not the biggest portions but adequate.
the decor is rustic, traditional japanese.
the crowd is mixed yuppies, young and old.
mediocre food
the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu.
service was decent.
– tucked away over by the beverly center.
on weekends, you might have to wait for couple hours.
the atmosphere was just okay.
it was decent but nothing exceptional.
the only problem would be the wait, but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting.
food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isnt a fancy place.
and they give good quantity for the price.
good food, great service, average prices (for the strip)
– i decided to eat at stack because of their price fixed pre-show dinner.
i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright.
it wasnt the freshest seafood ever, but the taste and presentation was ok.
it?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.
just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don?t look too far out of place.
waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd.
they arent the most talkative, but everytime ive been there they have been very busy, which probably accounts for the lack of conversation.
the pizza’s are not huge and the crust is thin…keep that in mind when you’re ordering.
plan on waiting 30-70 minutes.
its a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (thurs?sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.
– not bad.
portions was just enough for me, but may not be for a big eater.
fair menu selection.
the portions are big though, so do not order too much.
- mediocre service/quality
our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but i did remain puzzled by one issue:  who thinks that rays is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?
