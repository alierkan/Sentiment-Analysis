Yum!
Serves really good sushi.
Not the biggest portions but adequate.
Green Tea creme brulee is a must!
Dont leave the restaurant without it.
No Comparison
– I cant say enough about this place.
It has great sushi and even better service.

The entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need.
Ive been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date.
Snotty Attitude
– We were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast.
The owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint.
Good food!
This is a great place to get a delicious meal.
We never had to wait more than 5 minutes.
The staff is pretty friendly.
The onion rings are great!
They are not greasy or anything.
Overrated
– I was highly disappointed in the food at Pagoda.
The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns, the few they actually give you.....were not good.

Worst Service I Ever Had
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received.
Our waiter was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered, we were not given any water or utensils.
I complained to the manager, but he was not even apologetic.
I will never return again.
Fabulous Italian Food!
– I highly recommend Mioposto.
I am so happy to have a wonderful Italian restaurant in my neighborhood.
The wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy.

Finally a meal that you will remember for a long time!
– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants, its nice to see a place that bucks that trend, and just plain delivers high quality food and good service, period.

Rice is too dry, tuna wasnt so fresh either.

We were then charged for their most expensive sake ($20+ per serving) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price.

Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.
I dont know if Ill be back....
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place.
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before its edible, even when you order ahead.
BUt once done, its not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.
Best Sushi in town.
Everything you want and more, very fresh.

I went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast!
Every time 0-sixtynine is called the bartender buys everyone drinks!
Been there lots since and its always a good time.
Great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks.

Not alot of smoking places left in New York, but I have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city.
Kudos to these guys.
I found a new home and just moved with a long lease.
The sushi here is delicious!
They have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from; Atlantic or Pacific.
Ive had the Jellyfish, Horse Mackerel, Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others, and they were all good.

The decor is rustic, traditional Japanese.

The service was courteous and attentive.
Mediocre food
The outside patio area has an abbreviated menu.
My g/f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price.

We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.

It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa.

great beer
– My first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible!
We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food.
I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal.

Seattles BEST Winelist
– Rays (suprisingly) has the citys BEST  most diverse wine list.
The sommelier is fantastic, down-to-earth,  extremely knowlegable.
I would go back for the wine experience alone.
Nice job!
NOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS
– It is sad to see a place that was once THE place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch, now be the place that is a big DONT BOTHER.
The food is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).

What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment.
This establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of.
Perhaps now, Scooner or Later falls into the Dive category.
This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.
I hope one day Scooner or Later returns to what it once was.
Untill this happens, my advice is to STAY AWAY.

Well I guess its hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff.
We stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us.
Finally, my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked, Are you waiting for a table?
Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal.
The prior reviews said Kid friendly... give me a break with two young children that is light years.
The Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I couldnt eat it.
It was decent but nothing exceptional.

There is only one place on the east coast that has it all, plus a lot more.
Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world: BLUE RIBBON SUSHI.
Cut to the chase - this is amazing!
Its unpretentious and underground.
Its fresh, welcoming, delicious, and relaxing.

To be honest, Ive had better frozen pizza.

Love it every time 
I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic; it has not let us down in any way, and weve eaten here more than 10 times.
The food is fantastic, and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time weve been there.

Never had one single problem there.
Seafood Plus
– This was  great dining experience.
If youre going to see Danny Gans or just staying at the Mirage, dont miss this one.
The appetizer of oysters, lobster, crab (small size) made a perfect entre for my wife.
Seabass on lobster risotto was the best.
Caesar salad was superb.
Great bottle of wine.
Leave room for dessert.
COMPLETELY OVER RATED!
The food was ok, but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.
The food was ok, but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.
Even then, the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items.
We had a very hard time getting the waitress attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.
As it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.
When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.
It was clear he didn’t really care.
AVOID THE PLACE
– Save yourself the waste of time  DO NOT visit.
When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy  the service was horrible!
When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy  the service was horrible!
I waited for 10-15 minutes for service ordered a beer  was never served again.
After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left.
I went home  looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that doesnt work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service  deceptive link.
I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago.
After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks  kept telling us shed be right with us.
We left without ever getting service.
As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again  it still doesnt work.
Best Crab Cakes in Town
– Thats a big statement considering Ive been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since I was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time.
If you can, come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening.
Great seasonal fish and seafood, with a classy waterfront setting.

best chinese food i have tasted in a long time
You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing.
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up.
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese.
First off, the food came fast and all together :) i like that... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other.
so about the prawns, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.

best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted.
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty.
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked.

not chewy at all.
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee... oh la la yummy!!!
melt in your mouth.
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant.
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.
Chintzy portions
– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).

Terrible service, food ok, pricey

We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that itd be a 30 minute wait.
We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!
None that I can think of.
We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didnt arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.
Um so now what are appetizers for???
Oh I forgot to mention that they dont have bread service.
My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasnt a priority for them to actually bring it.
In other words, if they arent making $$ off of you then you dont rate high on their service scale.
Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isnt a fancy place.

If I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park.
Its great if you spent the day there and didnt want to drive to eat.
Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.
Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.

While this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.
While this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.
As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.
When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.
A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been blown off would be an understatement.
The manager continually interrupted with Is there anything else I can do for you?, a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience.
She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadnt bothered to get the waitresses name.
In short, Schooner or Later couldnt have cared less about our being at their establishment.
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi...then this might be the place.
the fish was fresh, though it was cut very thin.

And they give good quantity for the price.

We were only in Seattle for one night and Im so glad we picked Rays for dinner!
I love Dungeness crabs and at Rays you can get them served in about 6 different ways!
We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu.
I ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting....yummy!
And the service was simply spendid - quite a delight.

You Cant Go Wrong Here.

The music is great, no night better or worse, the bar tenders are generous with the pouring, and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits.

– I decided to eat at Stack because of their price fixed pre-show dinner.
When I walked in, I was taken aback by their incredible wood decor.
The music playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop music, but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.

The 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great, at least initially.
The steak was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.
It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.

Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak.
My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.
They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.
The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.

I dont know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place.
I have been to this place, folks and it is BAD.
Maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish thats half-way decent.
I have been here, spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment.

Delectable 
Its a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (Thurs?Sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.
Once youre inside, the real experience begins.
Everything, and I mean everything on the menu is delectable.
The waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.
The sushi is as fresh as it comes?youd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!

big thick pepperoni

The pizza itself is not exactly the best Ive had EVER, but still pretty good.
I probably wouldnt go back though cuz I dont know if its worth it.
Maybe Ill go back once more many years from now when Ive forgotten I went there already.
Sit in the Balcony

Portions was just enough for me, but may not be for a big eater.

The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places.
I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd.
The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.
I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.

Insultingly Overpriced
- Mediocre Service/Quality
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu.

To start off, approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $3.
They serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.

I should have just asked for the check when I saw that; but their menu was so unique that I continued.
The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6 pancakes (one of them was more like 5) in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced.

The pancakes should be larger (at least 8) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings.

On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadnt rejected the meal all together.

I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.
To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.

In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).

Much more than just a great view!

– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Rays Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.
Rays is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Rays!

To start things off, our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order.
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Rays fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.

For my entreacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.

The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).

My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.

I had a taste of all three items on her plate, and they were superb.
Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Rays is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?

Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.
All considered, I have to say that Rays Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.
