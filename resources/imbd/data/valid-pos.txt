i really liked tom barman's awtwb .  you just have to let it come over you and enjoy it while it lasts ,  and don't expect anything .  it's like sitting on a café-terrace with a beer ,  in the summer sun ,  and watching the people go by .  it definitely won't keep you pondering afterwards ,  that's true ,  but that's not a prerequisite for a good film .  it's just the experience during the movie that's great .   i felt there were a few strands that could have been worked out a little more ,  but being a lynch fan i don't care that much anymore  :  )   and i *loved* the style ,  or flair of this movie .  it's slick ,  but fresh ,  and the soundtrack is a beauty .  any music-lover will get his kicks out of awtwb ,  i can assure you .   i'll give it 8 out 10 .    ( music-wise 10 out of 10 ) 
barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to .  just as simple as that ,  and he succeeded .  not only in his goal ,  but also in making a wonderful movie ,  especially visually .  he knows how to use pans ,  slow-motion sequences ,  tracking shots ,  crane shots ,  etc .  in a beautiful ,  smooth way .  this gives the movie a very relaxing feel to it .   the story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing :  a party that they all attend to ,  which also is the turnpoint of this movie .  the beauty of this picture lies not in the question how the characters have effect on eachother  ( in comparance with a similar ,  of course better movie like magnolia )  .  i simply don't think that that was barman's idea .  the beauty lies in the different details of experiences that people go through which makes or breaks their lives .  barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe little experiences .  he knows people .  .  .  .  .  and antwerp .   the soundtrack of the movie is also excellent ,  but not a surprise as we know that barman is also a very succesful songwriter and musician with his band deus .  the music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing which contributes to the sunny ,  smooth feel of the movie .  other times we hear funky pop/rock-melodies which give some scenes the strength that they need .   there's only one flaw ,  and that's the last half an hour .  was it the runtime ,  which was breaking me up ?  or weren't the last scenes that fresh and accurate than the scenes until then ?  i can't figure it out .  .  .   all in all a beautiful sunny movie which lifts the belgian cinema up .   8 out of 10 !    ( it's the breeze that flows through a girl's hair on a sunny afternoon making her even more beautiful ;  it's the fresh breeze that makes you relax when it passes you at a crowded party when someone opens the door ;  it's the breeze that carries the perfume from that beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park who you just met a week ago ;  it's the breeze .  .  .  .  .  )   
this belgian film ,  directed by tom barman ,  singer of the well-known group deus ,  will not be favoured by everyone .  for the simple reason that there isn't a clear story or even a plot .  this movie just shows 24 hours in  " a city "   ( here antwerp )  and allows you to watch and truly enjoy the dialogues ,  the directing ,  the humorous  ( dario !  ,  the osteopath bruno !  ,   .  .  .  )  and tragic  ( windman ,  paul garcin ,   .  .  .  )  characters .   there are several memorable scenes :  the windman on the beach ,  the dance party at the end ,  the kiss-fan ,  windman visits the osteopath ,  .  .  .   clearly some other viewers didn't understand what's so beautiful and interesting in this movie .  they complain that this movie has no story ,  etc .  but it's the atmosphere that keeps you watching and that will drag you into it .   if you didn't watch it yet ,  be sure to listen carefully to the music .  the soundtrack is extraordinary just like tom barman and his group deus .   and  " ssst ,  mondje dicht hé .  "   ( don't tell anyone ) 
any way the wind blows is tom barmans  ( who is also know as front man of the rock formation 'deus' )  debut movie .  entirely shot in antwerp  ( belgium )  ,  the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters .  when the movie ends ,  you have a lot of stuff to think about ,  because most of the different story-lines are left wide open .   the movie has a  ( purely instrumental )  sound track that will rock your socks off .  in most scenes ,  the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel ,  really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time .  the main scene in the film ,  the party ,  is very well shot .   the director didn't hesitate to use video clip techniques ,  having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks i've heard lately .   the screenplay is great stuff .  camera angles and colors are very well chosen .  the 'costumes' are very hot and very 'seventies' too .  and i loved  ( most of the )  acting .   the thing i liked most about the movie ,  are the subtle touches of absurd ,  surreal ,  very dry or even cynical humor that interleave .   without claiming to be a comedy  ( this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art )  ,  it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some times .   this is one more directors' debut that shouldn't be an ending .  i hope to see more tom barman movies in the future because i had a good time .  cheers . 
 " written on the wind "  is an irresistible ,  wonderfully kinky film ,  as only director sirk could have done it .  the movie is submerged in a bucket full of freudian symbols ,  weird melodramatics and colorful contrasts .  the connection between financial success and moral decay is the film's main theme .  sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism .  however ,  i prefer to see the movie as a prime example of what sirk could do with kitschy material .  the palette of colors is particularly impressive .  the acting in the film is great too .  rock hudson and lauren bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance ,  but the movie belongs to robert stack and dorothy malone  ( she deservedly won the best supporting actress oscar )  ,  who manage to keep the film at a boiling point .  kudos to frank skinner's pulsating score ,  russell metty's brilliant camera work  ( every single shot is a masterpiece in itself )  ,  and the production design department .  also ,  the title tune is a beauty .  it's an unforgettable movie . 
i'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals .  whatever the case ,  i'm sure i loved it .  from the wonderfully twisted ,  lurid ,  intertwining stories ,  to the deliciously sinister performances from robert stack and dorothy malone ,  to the vivid ,  gaudy colour with which it's all captured ,  this is high-class trash and it's great fun .  not to mention the amusingly sly and thinly veiled sexual subtexts which permeate the entire film ,  always threatening to escape from the image into the dialogue but never doing so .  i'd be lying if i said that the film's sheer entertainment value didn't contribute to my love for it ,  but there's some sort of bizarre artistry behind the unintentional  ( or was it ?  )  comedy and i really ,  really dug that .  i could really get into this melodrama stuff . 
written on the wind ,  directed by douglas sirk and released in 1956 ,  is like all of sirk's mid 50's films- pure melodrama .  yet it is engrossing ,  richly developed melodrama ,  and sirk's trademark lurid colour expressionism ,  throbbing ,  barely repressed emotions ,  symbolism and juxtaposition of the classes make this a film to crave .   the film opens brilliantly ,  with the four central characters and the plot being introduced as the credits are still rolling .  sirk uses a clever flashback structure to take us into his world .  .  .   robert stack and dorothy malone are magnificent as the two hadley  " kids "  ,  kyle and marylee .  he drinks and sleeps around with women .  she drinks and sleeps around with men .  they both are worth millions ,  thanks to the hadley oil business .  hunky ,  yet poor ,  mitch wayne  ( rock hudson )  is kyle's lifelong friend ,  and marylee's dream lover .  enter into this sordid mess lucy moore  ( lauren bacall )  ,  a slim ,  attractive young woman who falls under kyle's charms after he picks up a phone and flies her across the countryside one evening .  mitch loves her too ,  but kyle wins her .  they quickly marry ,  and kyle stops drinking .  but fate seems to be written on the wind ,  and it is not long before a conniving marylee  ( who will  " have mitch "  ,  marriage or no marriage )  ,  a secretly smitten mitch ,  the confused lucy and the sad drunk kyle come to blows .  .  .  .   malone is just wonderful as marylee hadley ,  thoroughly deserving her best supporting actress oscar .  she steals every scene she is in .  stack is almost just as good ,  amping up the melodrama ,  while still maintaining subtly and quiet desperation .  hudson and bacall are a lot more restrained than those two ,  yet it is in keeping with the characters they play .   so ,  what's all this melodrama really about it ?  well ,  a lot of things .  stack's powerful portrait of male inadequacy and fear ,  for one thing .  sirk surrounds stack with phallic symbols throughout the film- note his tiny little gun ,  the oil derricks and the ultimate phallic symbol ,  kyle's seeming inability to conceive children .  stack seems to be suffering from a massive male superiority complex ,  made worse by his father's preference for hudson ,  his sister's desire for hudson ,  and his suspicion that his wife is carrying on with hudson .  with all this wealth kyle hadley still ends up at the wrong end of town ,  buying cheap corn liquor like a  " bum "  .   it's about impossible dreams ,  and having to let go of them .  the river where kyle ,  marylee and mitch used to play when they were kids is constantly referenced throughout the film ,  symbolising kyle and  ( especially )  marylee's wish for the innocence and simplicity of youth .  in an excellent melodramatic scene ,  perfectly pulled off by malone ,  marylee's stands by the river and imagines herself again as a child ,  with voice-over of mitch telling marylee that she will always be his girl .  this is where sirk strikes a huge emotional chord with the viewer .  who hasn't dreamed about going back to that special place in childhood ?  who hasn't ,  at some point ,  lived on a treasured memory ?  who hasn't wanted something they couldn't have ?  and hudson's last line of the film  ( yes ,  he gets no dialogue in the last 10 or so minutes ,  only close-ups )  recollects on how  " far we've come from the river ,  marylee "  .  amazing . 
it's a strange ,  yet somehow impressive story ,  about love .  personnaly ,  i never run over such a twist-off story in real life .  but ,  i can image there is .   it's a story that promises to be  " sick "  from the title .  but ,  after i watch it ,  i didn't get this feeling of  " sickness "  which i would surely have regarding society rules .  it's something beautiful in this movie .  .  .  something impressive .  .  . which i cannot contradict using any moral or society rules .   the movie focuses mostly on relation between kiki and alex .  you can see how this relation starts ,  evolves and finally ends .  you feel the moment when this love blossoms ,  the first whispers ,  touchings .  you feel the connection .  and no moment i though this is immoral .  you even hope it will not break in the end .  .  .  . it cannot break .  .  . it's not right .  you feel the pain of being hart broken in the end .  .  .   but , i need also to add a negative spin to this comment .  .  . i don't know if the story is not somehow *showed* to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form ,  but not in content .  you don't have the total story ,  but only fragments .  when movie has started ,  the relation between kiki and sandu was already in place .  so ,  no clue about the nature of the relation .  you feel only a tension between them .  .  . a fight between the need for love and desire to break this relation .  i think this line of kiki to sandu says all :   " i want to stop .  .  . and if you love me ,  you will do as i ask you "  .   this movie will probably stir some questions about what is love and what is to be moral .  .  . and where's the limit between them .  i don't know if the idea of this movie is  " love conquers all .  .  . even social and moral standards "  or  " love is beautiful .  .  . no matter how or where "  .  but in my opinion ,  this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think .  .  . 
an overblown melodrama typical of its period  ( mid-1950s )  and appropriate matinée food .  rock hudson ,  the hulk everyone always falls in love with ,  plays his usual stereotype role ,  but whereas in giant ,  made the same year ,  when his material and co-stars  ( taylor & dean )  were above average ,  in this movie he is just not good enough to raise the calibre beyond a mushy tale of how difficult it is to be both rich and happy .  the self-destructive brother and sister  ( robert stack ,  reeling his way through the film in a drunken stupor ,  and dorothy malone ,  playing a vampish poor little rich girl totally over the top )  end up the losers and hudson gets bacall - who is rather wooden in this part which does not have enough character or wit to get her going .  to paraphrase oscar wilde ,  the good end happily and the bad unhappily ,  that is the meaning of fiction .  however ,  i was interested to read that the film is based on a true story which vindicated the plot .  like other films of the period ,  homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms .  maybe the film could be remade :  stack's character would ring truer if he was hiding homosexual feelings for mitch by marrying .  todd haynes's far from heaven greatly improved on all that heaven allows  ,  also directed by sirk .  perhaps haynes could remake written on the wind and give us a truly memorable film . 
on the surface ,   " written on the wind "  is a lurid ,  glossy soap opera about the sexual dysfunctions of a texas oil family .  but underneath it all is a deep ,  social commentary on 1950's life .  director douglas sirk scores again with another univeral sudser .  robert stack falls in love with lauren bacall .  the problem is that stack's best pal ,  rock hudson ,  loves her too .  when stack finds out he's sterile and bacall ends up pregnant ,  the fireworks fly .  and ,  the all-too-good dorothy malone won an oscar for her portrayl of texas' biggest nympho who is shunned by hudson .  good epic soap opera . 
director douglas sirk scores again with this ,  the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films .  this lush ,  trashy saga is a masterpiece ,  beautifully combining all of the elements of sirk's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie .   " written on the wind "  very obviously influenced the 1980s tv series  " dallas "  and  " dynasty "  ,  as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps .   lauren bacall ,  wonderfully and subtly ,  plays lucy moore ,  a new york city secretary who marries oil baron ,  kyle hadley  ( robert stack )  .  unbeknownst to both of them ,  mitch wayne  ( rock hudson )  is also in love with the quiet ,  but sexy secretary .  they all go back to kyle's family's mansion in texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister ,  marylee  ( dorothy malone in an oscar-winning turn )  .  yipee !  the sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights ,  this is a campy trip .  not only does mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife ,  but marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is mitch .  topping it all off ,  kyle learns he's impotent ,  but somehow lucy ends up pregnant .   this is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment .  how can you not love it ?  this film signals one of universal's most popular films and one of director sirk's best works .  some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is great .  the cast is great ,  although bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind hudson .  stack's oscar loss reportedly devastated him .  he considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out .  and he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic .  what a stunning movie !  this film proves what i've been thinking for ages - sirk is the master of classic melodrama .  where's his oscar ?   
***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** released in 1956 , and considered quite racy at the time ,  douglas sirk's over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing .  the plot concerns the goings on in an oil rich dysfunctional texas family that includes big brother kyle ,  who is insecure ,  weak ,  wounded & very alcoholic ,  played by robert stack in a very touching & vulneable performance and his sluty sister marylee played in an extreme manner by dorothy malone .  ms .  malone's performance is telegraphed to us via her eyes ,  which she uses to show us her emotions ,  which mostly consist of lust  ( for rock hudson )  and jealousy  ( for lauren bacall )  .  malone is the only actress i've ever seen in movies who enters a room eyes first .  now don't get me wrong ,  her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot ,  and is one of the supreme camp acting jobs of the 1950's .  but it is also terrible ,  because as likeable and attractive as malone is , she's not a very good actress ,  and she's not capable of subtly or shading .  her performace is of one note .  she does get to do a wicked mambo , and in a great montage ,  as unloving daddy played by the always good robert keith falls to his death climbing a staircase ,  sirk mixes it up with an almost mad malone doing a orgasmic dance as she undresses .  stack ,  ( who should have won an oscar )  & malone ,   ( who won the award ,  but shouldn't have )  are the real stars of the film ,  the ones who set all the hysteria ,  both sexual & otherwise in motion ,  while the  " real stars "  of the film ,  hudson & bacall fade to grey & brown , which are the colors that they are mainly costumed in .  hudson who was a better actor then given credit for plays the childhood & best friend of stack's ,  and the stalked love interest of malone's who moans & groans over rock through most of the film .  but hudson wants no part of her , and instead is in love with bacall who is married to stack .  no one is very happy & no one is happy for very long .  the stack-bacall marriage falls apart big time after a year ,  and stack pretty much drinks himself into oblivion because he thinks he is sterile ,  and can't give bacall a baby to prove that he's a man .  sirk who was a very intelligent man ,  and had a long & fascinating career both in films and theatre in germany ,  ended his hollywood career at universal in the mid 1950's with a series of intense vividly colored  " women's movies "  or melodramas .  although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source material , in sirk's hands they became masterpieces of the genre .  sirk had a wonderful sense of color & design which he brought to play in these films filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played out their emotional lives among weird color combinations & lighting ,  make believe shadows ,  and lots of mirroed reflections .  in  " written "  the characters are always peeking out of windows ,  listening at doors or sneaking around .  so in the end ,  after much violence ,  an accidental murder ,  a miscarriage & more sirk ends the movie with a final & startling scene of a  " reborn "  and reformed malone in a man-tailored suit ,  sitting at a desk foundling a miniature oilwell . 
in her autobiography , laureen bacall reveals that bogie told her that she should not make such dud movies as this one or something like that . at the time , douglas sirk was labeled  " weepies for women "  , actually , he was restored to favor , at least in europa , after he stopped directing . and when he filmed  " written on the wind "   , sirk had only three movies to make :  " tarnished angels "  ,  " a time to love and a time to die "  , his masterpiece , imho , and finally "  imitation of life "  ( 1960 )  . then there was silence .  actually bacall and hudson characters do not interest sirk . they are too straight , too virtuous . dorothy malone -who was some kind of substitute for his former german star zarah leander-and her brother robert stack provide the main interest of the plot . a plot constructed continuously  , most of the movie being a long flashback . the instability of the brother and the sister  , from a family of rich texan oil owners , is brought to the fore by garish clothes , and rutilant cars that go at top speed in a derricks landscape .  malone's metamorphosis at the end of the movie is stunning  : suit and chignon , toying with a small derrick : she's ready for life , the rebel is tamed .  now alone , because she's lost hudson  ( but anyway , he was not in love with her )  . this end is a bit reactionary , but melodrama is par excellence reactionary ; three years later , in  " imitation of life "  , sarah-jane  ( susan kohner )  will be blamed because she does not know her place . 
one thing about hollywood ,  someone has a success and it's always rushed to be copied .  and another thing is that players give some of their best performances away from their home studio .   rock hudson got such accolades for his performance in the texas based film giant that universal executives must have thought ,  let's quick get him into another modern texas setting .   similarly robert stack got great reviews for the high and the mighty as the pilot who was cracking under the strain of flying a damaged aircraft that it was natural to give him another crack up role .   both of these ends were achieved in written on the wind .  before hudson was the big ranch owner ,  now he's the son of a hunting companion of robert stack's father who took hudson under his wing .  in other words the james dean part without the james dean racism from giant .    lauren bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that stack's hadley oil company uses .  hudson likes her ,  but she's dazzled by stack's millions and when he woos a girl he's got the means to really pursue a campaign .  she marries stack .   and last but not least in the mix we have dorothy malone who's stack's amoral sister who has a yen for rock ,  but rock ain't about to get tangled up with this wild child .    dorothy malone spent over 10 years in a whole bunch of colorless film heroine roles before landing this gem .  she got a best supporting actress award for her part as marilee hadley and it was well deserved .   if you like splashy technicolor fifties soap opera than this is the film for you . 
another classic study of the effects of wealth on a southern family is masterfully depicted in written on the wind .   kyle hadley has it all .  wealth ,  a plane ,  you name it .  kyle's best friend ,  mitch ,  has always gotten him out of difficulty .  mitch finished college ,  kyle got thrown out .  mitch is not from a wealthy home .  kyle's family ,  with hadley oil ,  controls most of everything in the town .   while in n . y .  ,  kyle meets the girl of his dreams ,  nicely played by lauren bacall .  after a whirlwind romance ,  he marries her and brings her home .  there she meets her father-in-law who warns her how difficult kyle can be .  kyle sleeps with a gun under his pillow .  the bacall character meets kyle's sister ,  mary lee ,  a tramp if ever there were ,  played to the fullest by dorothy malone ,  who was voted best supporting actress .   rock hudson plays mitch ,  the faithful friend .   a year of wedded bliss for kyle and his bride ends when kyle is told by the doctor that he can't have children .  it is when his wife reveals to him that she is indeed pregnant ,  kyle ,  thinking that the child is mitch's ,  goes on a drunken frenzy and is accidentally shot dead in a memorable scene .   mary lee ,  who has always loved mitch ,  tries but is unsuccessful in blaming mitch for kyle's death .  in a memorable courtroom scene ,  malone pulled out all the stops in finally admitting that kyle's death was an unfortunate accident .  her oscar was well deserved .   surprisingly ,  robert stack ,  brilliant as kyle hadley ,  was nominated for best supporting actor and lost in an upset victory by anthony quinn ,  as paul gauguin ,  in lust for life .   douglas sirk was the master of soap opera films of the 1950s .  written on the wind is no exception .  ***1/2 . 
douglas sirk directs this over-acted drama about the unhappy affluent .  kyle hadley ( robert stack ) and mitch wayne ( rock hudson )  are boyhood friends with different looks on life .  kyle is the womanizing son of an oil tycoon ;  mitch works for the hadley oil company .  both fall in love with the same woman ,  lucy moore ;  but it is kyle that has the means to wow her off her feet and marry her .  sister marylee ( dorothy malone ) seems to be the town's nymphomaniac and carrying a torch for mitch ,  who always seems to be the one to clean up the hadley's messes .  ambitious with pretension ;  a little over the top ,  but the stars make it a movie to see .  i was most impressed with malone .  rounding out the cast :  robert keith ,  edward platt ,  john lurch and robert j .  wilke . 
after playing a nymphomaniac in written on the wind ,  dorothy malone finally said good-bye to her sweet sister/wife roles and demonstrated an ability to play mantraps with the best of them .  she and gloria grahame played the same sort of tramps--and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role ,  malone won a best supporting actress oscar .   the film she's in is not quite up to oscar standards ,  but it is a strong enough melodrama under douglas sirk's capable hands .  there's an almost noirish look to the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has rock hudson ,  lauren bacall ,  robert stack and dorothy malone as its headliners .   domestic squabbles among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama ,  with the accent on the strong supporting players ,  stack and malone .  both of them seize the opportunity with both hands and stack ,  too ,  should have been awarded for his sterling job as the weak ,  alcoholic brother driven to desperation by his own wild motives .   the nominal stars have less impressive work to do ,  but do it with their usual skill and conviction--hudson and bacall .  they play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding .   the use of color is particularly striking  ( as it usually is in a sirk film )  and yet it doesn't preclude me from thinking of the film as a technicolor film noir in the vein of leave her to heaven .   well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast . 
stack should have received the academy award for this performance ,  period .  its a crime that he did not .  amazing how he humanizes a rich worthless character .    dorothy malone did earn a well-deserved academy award for her performance .  in fact ,  all of the acting in this film is excellent .   the plot begins with a taxi ride ,  then an airplane ride ,  then keeps moving on an emotional ride that will hold your interest throughout .  you will be entertained !   however ,  this is only a blatant soap opera .  one-dimensional ,  100-percent soaper .  you might call it the ultimate soaper ,  because the acting so thoroughly triumphs over the material .  excellently acted ,  well directed ,  but strictly within its soap genre .  i wouldn't even call it a melodrama  ( such as  " mildred pierce "  or  " imitation of life "  )  .  while not denying the great entertainment value of this film ,  you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter . 
i think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second ,  as someone else wrote in a comment ,  the implications of this kind of relationships  ( incest and lesbianism )  in the romanian society .   so .  .  .  to begin with the second aspect .  .  .  to make it short ,  it wasn't visible at all .  .  .   as for the first .  .  as i said ,  it had much more potential .  .  .  i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension .  .  .  much more tension .  .  .  and the potential tension didn't get through .  .  .   i think the soundtrack could've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme  ( wich was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments )  .  .  .  yeah .  .  .  i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack .  .   the actors .  .  .  i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10 .  .  .  not enough sensuality in the key moments .  .  .   a total of 7/10 .  .  .  .  mostly for the story
this gloriously turgid melodrama represents douglas sirk at his most high strung .  it eschews the soft wistfulness of  " all that heaven allows "  and the weepy sentimentality of  " imitation of life "  and instead goes for feverish angst and overheated tension .  and of course ,  it's all captured in vibrant technicolor .   the cornball story has something to do with a friendship between rock hudson and robert stack that becomes a rivalry when hudson snags the affections of lauren bacall ,  but who's really paying attention to the story ?  dorothy malone won a best supporting actress academy award for her splendidly over-the-top performance as stack's sister ,  who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will .  a highlight of the film comes when this high-spirited wild child breaks into a frantic dance in her bedroom ,  unable to bear the restraints placed upon her by middle-class propriety .  as so frequently happens in sirk movies ,  the scene is both unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity and yet strangely moving in its effectiveness .   sirk came closer than anyone else to turning pure camp into high art ,  satisfying the philistines and the high brows at the same time within the same films .  his was a unique talent and i don't know that there's ever been another film maker quite like him since .   grade :  a-
lauren bacall was living through husband humprey bogarts illness & death when she did this film .  rock hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom .  dorothy malone is in excellent form ,  and wins an oscar for support .  robert stack is nominated & falls just short for his role .   the story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas .  amazing how well drunks can drive in this film & also how quickly stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequences .   you can see why the cast is so good & actually production wise this film is very good .  you can tell bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine ,  she looks emotionally drained in some sequences .   the sexual references in this film are so mild ,  that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are .  film does a good job telling a story & actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end though none ever was made- though written beyond the wind would be a good title . 
 " written on the wind "  is a douglas sirk's melodrama .  douglas sirk was rediscovered by the  " cahiers du cinema "  ,  fassbinder etc .  .  that hailed him as a master director - i think that it is because of the sophistication of his cinematography -  " written on the wind "  offers luscious color images and gorgeous decors .  but i ask myself :  is this enough to carry a film ?  the acting in  " written on the wind "  ranges from weak to fair  ( excepting robert stack - he is convincing as the weak & spoiled playboy )  .  lauren bacall ,  normally a powerful presence in the screen ,  is miscast in this film .  dorothy malone as the seductress ,  the care-free  " femme fatale "  is ok ,  but she lacks the strength for the role .  rock hudson is efficient but vapid  .   the plot has very interesting ingredients .  the main characters are :    a rigid patriarch   his alcoholic son kyle  ( robert stack )   ( never loved by the disappointed father )    his frustrated and nymphomaniac daughter marylee  ( dorothy malone )   lucy  ( lauren bacall )  - a woman of principles ,  formerly a secretary and now married to kyle   mitch  ( rock hudson )  - brought up together with kyle and loved by the patriarch .    secrets beyond the door ,  a love triangle ,  frustration ,  fistfights ,  laughter ,  death etc .  - well ,  when i read the story summary on the back cover of the dvd i thought that i was in for a treat .  my mistake !  why ?  i'll try to explain :   " written on the wind "  takes itself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story .  as i said before the acting ,  in general ,  is not good enough - the intensity is lacking .  there are many strong scenes in the story ,  but the actors just do an efficient job .  i think that maybe with italian or spanish actors those scenes would have been explored fully - they would end  ( for us )  in an explosion of laughter or tears  .   what remains to us is the beautiful cinematography of douglas sirk .  for me this is not enough .  if you want to enjoy a good melodrama ,  see  " aventurera "  . 
the absolute summum of the oeuvre of that crafty dane douglas sirk  ( born detlef sierck )  ,  written on the wind compels our prurient attention in every gaudy frame .  from its justly famous opening sequence ,  with the leaves blowing into the baronial foyer of a texas mansion and the wind riffling the pages of the calendar into a flashback ,  the movie compresses into its 99 minutes all the familial intrigue that was to fuel such later ,  little-screen knockoffs as dallas ,  dynasty and falcon crest over their years-long runs .   the combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme americans ,  in our dollar-based society ,  find irresistible .  brother and sister robert stack and dorothy malone are the spoiled ,  troubled heirs to the hadly oil fortune ;  boyhood chum rock hudson and new bride lauren bacall are the sane outsiders who try to keep the lid on the roiling cauldron .   ( it's been rumored that the story was based on libby holmann's marriage into reynolds tobacco money .  )  as always ,  the misfits get all the scenery to chew -- and the best lines to spit out  ( malone ,  in her oscar-nabbing performance as the boozing nymphomaniac with a jones for hudson ,  gets to detonate a whole fireworks display of them )  .  hudson ,  while good ,  can't compete with all this over-the-top emoting ;  bacall starts out strong but grows recessive ,  a mere plot convenience .  no matter ;  with a succession of set-pieces shot in extravagant hues ,  sirk gives an object lesson in how to turn out overwrought melodrama set in the lush consumer paradise of late-50s america .  nobody ever did it better . 
on 24 october 1955 ,  the hard-work geologist of the hadley oil company mitch wayne  ( rock hudson )  meets the executive secretary lucy moore  ( lauren bacall )  in the office of her boss bill ryan in new york and invites her to go to a conference with the alcoholic playboy and son of a tycoon kyle hadley  ( robert stack )  .  on the way of the meeting ,  he confesses that they had traveled from houston to new york to satisfy the wish of the reckless kyle ,  who is his best friend since their childhood ,  of eating a sandwich from club 21 and the meeting was just a pretext to kyle's father jasper hadley  ( robert keith )  .  mitch and kyle immediately fall in love for lucy ,  and kyle unsuccessfully uses his money to impress lucy ;  then he opens his heart and proposes lucy .  they get married and travel to acapulco and the insecure kyle stops drinking .  meanwhile ,  kyle's sister marylee  ( dorothy malone )  is an easy woman and has a non- corresponded crush on mitch that sees her as a sister .  one year later ,  kyle discovers that he has a problem and might be sterile and starts drinking again .  the jealous marylee poisons kyle telling that his wife and mitch are having a love affair .  when lucy finds that she is pregnant ,  kyle believes that the baby belongs to mitch and his mistrust leads to a tragedy .     " written on the wind "  is an overrated melodramatic soap opera ,  with artificial characters and situations .  there are at least two great movies with characters with drinking problem :   " the lost weekend "   ( 1945 )  with stunning performance of ray milland and  " days of wine and roses "   ( 1962 )  with awesome performance of jack lemmon .  robert stack has a reasonable performance and his character's motives for drinking are shallow and clichés .  in the end ,  the forgettable  " written on the wind "  is entertaining only and never a feature to be nominated to the oscar .  my vote is seven .   title  ( brazil )  :   " palavras ao vento "   (  " words in the wind "  ) 
fabulous film !  rented the dvd recently and was floored by this stunning piece of work .  douglas sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of rock hudson ,  dorothy malone  ( oscar winner )  ,  robert stack  ( oscar nominated )  ,  and lauren bacall that words cannot describe .  paul verhoeven brilliantly payed homage to this film by having dorothy malone play sharon stone's murdering inspirational guru in his basic instinct .  what a great joke !    by turns the film is hilarious ,  riveting ,  campy ,  biting ,  trashy ,  compelling ,  and eye rolling !  it's definately the grandaddy of every tawdry big-and-little screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like you'll see here :  the camera work is smooth and polished ,  the use of color is breathtaking ,  the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable ,  the one dimensional characters are unforgettable ,  and the final image will have you scratching your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut !    while most older ,  highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through ,  written on the wind contains so much and goes by so fast that it's actually a shame when it ends .  thank you to mr .  sirk for crafting -and todd haynes for drawing attention to- what has now become one of my favorite films of all time !  see this movie !  !  ! 
 " written on the wind "  was an enormously successful universal picture .  it could only be done by douglas sirk ,  a man who saw the possibilities in the material he was given .  based on a popular novel by robert wilder and an adaptation by george zuckerman ,  it had all the elements that make an excellent melodrama :  nymphomania ,  a large oil fortune ,  alcoholism ,  incest and a mild touch of homosexuality .  mr .  sirk laid the path for what would follow later on in the soap operas genre ,  mainly ,   " dallas "  and  " dynasty "  ,  just to mention two .   the fact is this movie was shot entirely inside a studio .  most of the decor is phony .  like a lot of those 1950s pictures ,   " written on the wind "  was shot entirely in a studio lot .  just look at the scenes that are supposed to take place in manhattan ,  or miami ,  or even the lake are ,  one can see how the scenery is a painted backdrop .  mr .  sirk couldn't care less about realism as long as he could tell the story his own way .   we recently caught a screening ,  part of a revival of mr .  sirk's work ,  where people were laughing at some of the most dramatic moments ,  especially during the scenes where rock hudson ,  who plays the good mitch wayne ,  appears .  there is also something graphic in the way that both robert keith ,  who plays the patriarch jasper hadley ,  and later on his own daughter ,  the evil marylee ,  caress the oil derrick that adorns the elder man's desk ,  a sort of phallic object d'art .   douglas sirk probably wanted his cast to give over the top performances ,  which makes sense in the way dorothy malone portrays the nymphomaniac marylee ,  and to a certain degree ,  robert stack ,  who overacts as kyle ,  the tormented heir of the story .  that would probably be the easy explanation of what comes across the screen .  the only one that seems normal is lauren bacall ,  who wasn't asked to make her lucy moore character appear to be anything but a grounded person caught hanging out with the wrong crowd .   together with his other hollywood movies ,   " written on the wind "  shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public just what they wanted to see :  stories bigger than life that could only be seen on the big screen
another in the they don't make em like that category .  this story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean ,  sometimes over-the-top fun .  robert stack and dorothy malone are at their peak as the troubled hadley siblings ,  and they really took the roles and ran with them .  malone won an oscar and stack was nominated in the supporting categories ,  both honors being eminently well-deserved .  they counterbalance the somewhat bland leads .  neither bacall nor hudson could ever be called bad actors ,  but they've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here .  it's kind of hard for me to accept rock hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here ,  but that's more of a personal bias than anything else .  but that doesn't take away from the movie's overall entertainment value ,  which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable .  if you're up some night and this movie comes on i'd say watch it .  it's well worth it . 
does any one know what the 2 sports cars were ?  i think robert stack's might have been a masseratti . rock hudson's character told his father he was taking a job in iraq  , isn't that timely ?  i have had dorthy malone in my spank bank most of my life  , maybe this was the film that impressed me . loren bacall sure did have some chops in this film and probably out-acted malone but malones's part made a more sensational impact so she got the oscar for best supporting role . was loren's part considered a leading role ? old man hadley character was was probably a pretty common picture of tycoons of his era in that he was a regular guy who made it big in an emerging industry but in building a whole town he had forgotten his children to have his wife bring them up . in time , being widowed he realized that they were all he really had and they were spoiled rotten , looking for attention , so rather than try to relate to his children he blew his head off . an ancient morality tale . but seriously , what were those sports cars ? 
rich ,  alcoholic robert stack falls in love with secretary lauren bacall .  he marries her and is so happy he stops drinking .  however ,  bacall is secretly loved by stacks' best friend ,  rock hudson .  and stacks' nymphomaniac sister ,  dorothy malone ,  lusts after rock .  throw in a few complications and the movie goes spinning out of control  ( in a good way )  .   very glossy movie in beautiful technicolor with jaw-dropping fashions and furnishings  ( check out bacall's hotel room at the beginning )  .  everybody looks perfect and dresses in beautiful ,  form-fitting clothes .  basically this is a soap opera with grade a production values .  the story itself is lots of fun and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously over the top .  the acting by hudson ,  stack and bacall isn't that good ,  but seeing them so young and glamorous is great .  .  . especially stack .  .  . when he smiled my knees went weak !  dorothy malone ,  on the other hand ,  is fantastic--she deservedly won best supporting actress for her role .  she's sexy ,  violent ,  vicious and sympathetic .  .  . all convincingly .    fun ,  glossy trash .  don't miss it ! 
i saw this film at the chicago reeling film festival .  to pick up on the previous reviewer's remarks ,  the claustrophobic feel and off colors of the film is i sense quite intentional and conveys the sense of limited space ,  drab architecture ,  overall drabness that constitutes the urban environment of most people in eastern and central europe .  a bit shabby housing project style is how i'd describe it ,  and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities .  i can't say that i'm familiar with bucharest ,  romania where the action unfolded ,  but i have visited and lived in eastern europe for six months .    when i visited russia as a student for a semester ,  my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building ,  just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman ,  because the elevators weren't working .  but ,  i do concur with the reviewer ,  that the claustrophobia and muted colors ,  it's overdone ,  for there are ,  to be sure ,  beautiful historic buildings ,  parks ,  squares you can find in bucharest or in any historic city center of eastern europe ,  and bucharest's didn't get much of any footage in this film .  for me watching this film conveys well the claustrophobia that i would feel during my half-year stay there ,  feeling trapped and limited .   ( it makes you see why someone would want to immigrate and find a better life ,  just as people if hope to escape from a united states urban ghetto .  )    also ,  given the climate of homophobia ,  say ,  circa ,  us in the 1980s ,  the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter ;  hence ,  the focus on their interaction in the apartment .   it's remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in romania ,  and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing .  it's unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film ,  and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources .  the actors were fairly good and believable ;  the dialog was overall well done ,  and i could identity with these women .   the film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women ,  kiki ,  an energetic ,  fun-loving free spirit with a dark ,  troubling secret  ( her admiration and love for an abusive ,  incestuous brother ,  sandu )  falls in love with alexandra ,  a bright ,  bookish ,  idealistic young woman who moves to bucharest to begin her college studies .  opposites attract ,  and their personalities seem to complement one another ,  though there is some tension between the ambitious ,  studious ,  intellectual alexandra and kiki ,  who seems to be attending college to please her parents .  keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable ,  though we don't get any sense of the tension it requires ,  nor do we ever see or meet any other students--hard to believe--and the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed .  the chief threat to their love is kiki's brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him .  but kiki's love for alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond ,  or does it ?  that's what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops ,  and i won't say how it concludes .   ironically ,  kiki's love  " sickness "  isn't love for another woman ,  but her illicit ,  incestuous love for her brother .  thus ,  loving a woman offers the potential cure to the sickness of loving a sibling .    though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic ,  overly confined to interactions between kiki and alexandra ,  it was still engaging and moving to watch ,  so i'll give it a 7 . 
director douglas sirk once said `there's a very short distance between high art and trash ,  and trash that contains craziness is by this very quality nearer to art' .  this statement defines his cinema perfectly ,  a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations ,  adventure and war films ,  westerns and of course ,  his famous melodramas .   sirk's melodramas were ,  as the very word signifies ,  dramas with music .  the music sets the tone for his masterful style ,  and every stroke of his brush  ( sirk was also a painter )  leaves a powerful image on the screen-turned-canvas .  but this ain't life but its representation ,  an imitation of life .  sirk never tried to show reality ,  on the contrary .  none of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by hollywood  ( most notably technicolor )  to distinguish the artificial from the real thing .  let's remember that his golden period coincides with the time when hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama  ( blackboard jungle ,  rebel without a cause )  .  sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else .   another of sirk's statements summarizes this :  `you can't reach ,  or touch ,  the real .  you just see reflections .  if you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass' .  i defy anybody that has seen written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen .  one ends up giving up .   therefore ,  we are in a hall full of mirrors where there's no difference between real and its false copy .  nobody can say that the hadley are real people .  that town ain't real either ,  with those hideous oil pumps all over the place .  so in this realm the acting is affected ,  the decore is fake ,  the trick is visible .  everything is pushed a little bit off the limit  ( the sexual connotations of dorothy malone with the oil tower ,  for example )  .  sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time .   `the angles are the director's thoughts ;  the lighting is his philosophy' .  in written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows .  the hadleys house ,  with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way .  a house that resembles a mausoleum ,  that no party can cheer up .  as tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night ,  sirk's photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters ,  and so are the colours of the clothes they wear .  drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director's craft .   sirk considered himself a `story bender' ,  because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose .  written on the wind is a good example .  it wouldn't work in any other hands .   the other director that was using similar strategies was frank tashlin ,  who was for 50's comedy the same that sirk was for melodrama .  their films are full of the machinery of american life -advertising ,  tv sets ,  jukeboxes ,  washing machines ,  sport cars ,  vacuum cleaners- to depict its emptiness and decay .  i'm inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences .  the game was played by both sides ,  so it was camp .  now we regard them as `cult' or `bizarre' ,  because we are not those spectators anymore .  that is why todd haynes's homage `far from heaven' turns into a pastiche ,  because it reproduces sirk's work nowadays as if nothing happened in between .  then sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that julianne moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned film .   sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly .  there were always immovable characters  ( rock hudson and lauren bacall here )  against which he could assemble a series of split ones .  his balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters ,  because these are the ones sirk is interested in too .  when robert stack flies the plane and `tempts' lauren bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them  ( obvious faustian echoes )  we are strangely fascinated with him too ,  as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with mitch alone by the river .   in the sirk's universe the studio often-imposed `happy ends' have no negative impact .  in fact they worked just great .  sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the deux ex machinea of his day .  thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback ,  so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the hadley feud .   it was pointed out the many similarities between written on the wind with the godfather saga .  i absolutely agree and i'm sure the parallel is not incidental .  both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family .  the temperamental son portrayed by robert stack has an amazing physical resemblance with jimmy caan's sonny corleone .  the action of fighting her sister's male friend is symmetrical .  the non-son in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films ,  as the fact that both families carry the names of their town .  even details as the gate that gives access to the property ,  and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves ,  suggest that coppola had written on the wind in mind while setting his masterwork .  because both films deal with the subject of power :  the acquisition of power ,  its manipulation and legacy  ( even kyle hadley's sterility ,  the event that hastens the turmoil ,  is an issue easily tied to the central theme of power ,  in this case ,  a weakness in sexual power )  .  the other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is citizen kane .  one wouldn't think at first of similarities between welles and sirk's films but there are a good many ,  starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family's fortune and ending in the fact that mitch wayne  ( rock hudson )  ,  as charles foster kane ,  was adopted by a tutor ,  having his own father alive .  amazingly ,  the same actor  ( harry shannon )  perform both wayne and kane's fathers .  this detail is cannot be a coincidence .   written on the wind is a masterpiece in every aspect ,  in execution and vision ,  in style and technique ,  a highlight in the career of this wonderful director .  some say that this is his best film .  in my opinion ,  `magnificent obsession' ,  `all that heaven allows' ,  `there's always tomorrow' and `imitation of life' are just as good .  and for those who put sirk in the level of dallas or dinasty i wish them no happy end . 
it is ironic that during the '50s ,  when douglas sirk was at his most successful in terms of audience appeal ,  he was virtually ignored by the critics he is now seen ,  however ,  as a director of formidable intellect who achieved his best work in melodrama   " written on the wind "  is about the downfall of a texan oil dynasty surrounded by worthless reputation ,  alcoholism ,  and nymphomania it is about the twisted ,  fatal connections between sex ,  power ,  and money .  .  .   stack draws a compelling portrait of a tormented drunken destroyed by frustration ,  arrogance ,  jealousy ,  insanity ,  and some deep insecurities  dorothy malone succeeds as an attractive woman with an excessive sexual appetites ,  degrading herself for hudson and to other fellows in town her best line :   " i'm filthy .  "  in one frantic scene ,  we see her shaking ,  quivering and sweating to a provocative mambo in another weeping alone over a model oil-derrick at her father's desksymbol of excessive wealth and masculine tyranny  the frenetic atmosphere is both made palatable and intensified by sirk's magnificent use of colors ,  lights ,  and careful use of mirrors
the film begins with vincent price about to begin his performance as a magician .  however ,  mid-way through the very successful show ,  the police come and shut him down .  it seems that his old boss had cheated him out of the tricks price had created--even those he made on his own time at home .  as a result ,  price justifiably kills the evil man .  the problem is that while the viewer understood why price killed and most probably thought this was a good thing ,  because price was a bit mad ,  he just couldn't stop at one  ( sort of like eating lay's potato chips )  .   the film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks  ( including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for the shows )  ,  great plot twists as well as exciting action .  one thing you can't say about this film is that it is dull .  while it's also far from subtle ,  it is fun throughout ,  though and well worth a look .   had i never seen vincent price's version of house of wax ,  i probably would have liked the mad magician a lot more and scored it an 8 or 9 .  that's because while the mad magician is a wonderful film ,  it's highly reminiscent of the film that preceded it  ( house of wax )  .  the bottom line is that since house of wax was so successful ,  the formula was re-hashed in the follow-up film .  both were made in 3-d ,  both have a plot where price has every justification to kill but he can't stop once he's committed the first and both are great fun to watch .  the biggest differences ,  and there are few ,  are that house of wax was in color and was more of a horror film and the mad magician was definitely more of a mystery .   my advice is to see this film and house of wax  ( the price version only )  .  they are both terrific 1950s horror films . 
robert stack never really got over losing a best supporting actor oscar for his role as kyle in  " written on the wind "  to anthony quinn's 12-minute performance in  " lust for life .  "  stack plays the deeply disturbed ,  alcoholic son of an oil tycoon .  he has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised ,  mitch ,  played by rock hudson .  they both love the same woman ,  lucy ,   ( lauren bacall )  ,  who becomes kyle's wife .  kyle's sister ,  marylee  ( dorothy malone )  ,  is a drunken slut who's in love with mitch .  their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of douglas sirk ,  who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films ,  including  " imitation of life ,  "   " all that heaven allows ,  "   " magnificent obsession ,  "  and many others .   make no mistake - this is a potboiler ,  and stack and dorothy malone make the most of their roles ,  malone winning a best supporting actress oscar .  there's one amazing scene ,  mentioned in other comments ,  where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase .  we're led to believe that marylee sleeps with everyone ,  including the guy that pumps the gas ,  because she's in love with mitch .  mitch wants nothing to do with her .  he's so in love with lucy that ,  out of loyalty to kyle ,  he wants to go to work in iran to avoid temptation .  i doubt he'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was .   hudson and bacall have the less exciting roles here - hudson's mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up kyle's messes for his entire life ,  and bacall is mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety .  sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players .   in sirk's hands ,   " written on the wind "  is an effective film ,  and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting .  the director had a gift for this type of movie ,  and though he had many imitators ,  he never had an equal . 
i'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details ,  but this movie just hit me deep .  i don't think i'll ever forget it .  one scene especially  ( i think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one i am speaking )  is imprinted on my brain .   i also watched the similar movie lilja 4-ever  ( as referred to by a previous commentator )  .  it was also very moving ,  but not quite as straight to the point and brutal .  if you are sensitive at all ,  either will bring tears to your eyes ,  but anjos do sol  ( angels of the sun )  may stay with you forever .   this is very depressing subject matter ,  but i think ,  no ,  i hope that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to it .   more people need to see this film !  !  !  !  !  ! 
at the academy awards ceremony on march 27 ,  1957 ,  dorothy malone won the best supporting actress oscar for her torrid ,  over-the-top portrayal of a spoiled heiress of a texas oil tycoon in written on the wind .  the 1956 potboiler ,  adapted from robert wilder's novel  ,  was a veritable three-ring-circus showcasing alcoholism ,  greed ,  impotence and nymphomania .   malone's performance as marylee hadley  ,  a lonely rich girl who picks up men to assuage the pain of rejection from a former childhood sweetheart ,  was representative of the movie as a whole .  mesmerizing to watch even as it resorts to the  " lowest -common- denominator "  melodrama ,  written on the wind is ultimately the work of one man ,  the incredibly gifted director douglas sirk ,  an émigré from pre -world war 2 weimar germany who left his european theater heritage behind to pursue a career in hollywood .   an extremely erudite man ,  sirk made a name for himself in the 1950's as universal studios' reliable director of lavish soap operas ,  most notably with ross hunter's productions of magnificent obsession  ,  all that heaven allows and imitation of life  .  independent producer albert zugsmith offered sirk the opportunity to work outside the limiting constraints of universal's demure entertainments and create a more adult  ,   " sensational "  product  ,  hence the sultry wind and its follow-up ,  1957's tarnished angels ,  both released under the universal international banner .  it's anyone's guess why sirk didn't pursue loftier themes ,  but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas appealed more to his artistic sensibilities .  written on the wind could be considered sirk's epic soap opera  ;  indeed ,  it is so rife with human vulnerability and neurosis as depicted among the very rich that it is as compelling to watch as any real life domestic squabble among the rich and famous ,  perhaps more so .  robert stack  ( not an actor typically known for over -emoting )  nearly matches malone in intensity with his offering of the weak- willed brother kyle hadley ,  a mere shadow of his patriarchal father .  when he finds out that he is unable to impregnate his new bride  (  a beautifully leonine lauren bacall  )   ,  hadley goes off the deep end ,  escalating an already serious drinking problem with a  " secret  "  gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb .  both brother and sister ,  as venal and unlikeable as they are ,  are presented as victims of their past ,  giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous  (  and far more interesting than the 'good "  side of the family ,  mainly bacall and the impossibly handsome rock hudson  ,  young hadley's old boyhood friend and business associate ,  a surrogate son to the old man and malone' s unattainable object of desire .   )  despite all the domestic co-dependency on display  ,  it's not so much the story that is memorable here as the way it is filmed .  with a real panache for pictorial composition and editing ,  director sirk draws his audience into this picture with the most heightened technicolor cinematography imaginable  :  every single shot in this film is an eye-filling canvas of saturated colors ,  from the sight of a tank-like pink cadillac pulling up to an enormous mansion's front doors to the garish decor of a luxury miami hotel  ,  a spectrum of hues almost blinding in their diversity .  action and dramatic scenes feature sirk's adept use of tilted camera angles  ,  shadowy lighting and cross-cut editing  ,  shown to greatest effect in the scene where a rebellious  ,  drunken malone dances uninhibitedly in her upstairs bedroom to the loud blaring of a record player while her stricken father precariously ascends the huge staircase  ;  the scene is so riveting that you swear you are experiencing a great oedipal drama unfold .  what you're really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind ,  gussied up in lurid technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius . 
the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening .  .  .  was there a lot of symbolism ?  .  .  .  the 2 goldfishes - do they mean something in thai culture ?  there's not much plot ,  not much happens and it just meanders along .  no real start ,  no real middle and no real end .  rather unsatisfying really .   it was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know them .  .  . it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real .  the move felt chaotic and disjointed .  i don't know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve .  maybe if i were thai it would make more sense .  .  . 
a young girl surviving as a prostitute .   a cheap hustler who wants to get the big score .   they meet each other in thailand .  you may think by the opening titles it's going to be a violent movie but it is also a story of love with two persons in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life .  this film feels like an essay sometimes because of its changes of images ,  but still refreshing .  this story is also about eros and thanatos .   " it's not an original joke but it is well told "  says a character and that also applies to this one :  we've seen the story but this way we see it .  thailand appears in hot tones ,  the photograph going from one colored to a multicolored place .  and it captures the city as the cage of this imperfect persons .  there is also a good use of the music to dot the actions . 
it was fabulous !  the photography ,  editing ,  cinematography ,  music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination .  it was the enjoyment of  " slumming ,  "  without going through the danger .  we were there !  the dream sequences and flashback-sequence-ending were fresh .  it spoke to me .  keep up the good work !  another of that genre is city of god .  also - don't laugh !  - the comedy ,  desperately seeking susan .  nice ensemble types ,  with great performances by all .  sorry ,  i think training day fits that genre as well ,  with fantastic performances by an ensemble cast .  i had to switch the channel on some of the gritty sequences ,  but all-in-all ,  a great film ! 
i've just watch 2 films of pang brothers ,  the eye and one take only .  when i watched the eye ,  i was kind of disappointed about this two guys ,  who i had heard good words about them before .  that film  ( the eye )  has a really bad script ,  especially the ending  ( childish , cliche and too coincident in my opinion )   ,  but its still good in photography and experimental images .  so i decided to see one take only and i didn't disappointed again .  still great photography ,  stunning image ,  mtv-style editing ,  cool music and this time , the story has a lot of indie spirit , logical and beautiful ,  you'll see some tiny plot holes ,  but it doesn't cause any trouble with the storyline .  the only problem about this film is i get a bad dvd . 
this movie was directed by victor nunez who also wrote the screenplay  ( ulee's gold )  .  nice and straightforward writing ,  that was nominated for the independent spirit award ,  looking at ruby's day to day life .  what we see is a slice in the life of the young woman ruby .  ashley judd  ( sisters )  won the independent spirit award best female lead for this role .  ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity .  she explores jobs ,  friendships ,  boy friends ,  sex ,  a typical young adult search .  the movie won grand jury prize at the sundance film festival .  as an independent film enthusiast i picked the movie because of sundance .  i appreciate this type of movie ,  because it does not carry the hollywood baggage .   although the stories are completely different this reminded me of nobody's fool ,  staring paul newman .  the later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man .  i like that .  the story is very nicely told ,  and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story .  the only thing i am not sure about is the title .  i am sure that there are not that many bugs ,  and flies in paradise as there are in florida .  as i am allergic to mosquitos ,  florida is no paradise to me ,  i itch all over thinking about florida .  i turn into a complete red boil .  i recommend this movie !  favorite scenes :  ruby and her friend rochelle bridges ,  played by allison dean walking at the beach of panama city ,  florida .  indeed the sand is very white .  i have been there .  favorite quotes :   " necessity has always been a good excuse .  "   " all that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now ,  who is going to be and when and why .  "   
this movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown america for a young girl on her own .  the realism and subtle nuances ,  offered to ashley judd's character ,  ruby ,  by the storyline ,  capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of florida .  from the slam of a screen door ,  to the lack of work ,  the echoes of what life is really like on the  " red-neck riviera "  provide rough choices for the young girl .  paradise did not come easy .  but she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit ,  and learns to be her own woman ,  with a strength that flows from within .  ashley judd's winning smile ,  and infectious gait exude warmth and command respect and admiration .  the careful pace of the character development resembles that of  " ulee's gold "  in 1997 ,  starring peter fonda ,  and also directed by victor nunez . 
i love ashley judd and think all of her movies are great .  ruby  in paradise is one of her best .  it is a very understated movie that you really have to watch close to appreciate it .  a story of a woman trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easy .  some of her movies such as kiss the girls and time to kill probably did better at the box office and video rentals .  they were very good movies  also ,  but take the time to really look at ruby and i think you will agree it is one of ashley's best .   
allison dean's performance is what stands out in my mind watching this film .  she balances out the melancholy tone of the film with an iridescent energy .  i would like to see more of her . 
this is an intimate movie of a sincere girl in the real world out of hollywood's cheap fantasy is a very good piece of its class ,  and ashley judd fills the role impeccably .  it may appear slow for thrill seekers though .  cool movie for a calm night .   
in northeastern of brazil ,  the father of the twelve years old illiterate maria  ( fernanda carvalho )  sells his daughter to the middle man of a prostitution organization ,  tadeu  ( chico dias )  ,  to be employed as a housemaid and have a better life .  however ,  the girl is resold to the farmer lourenço  ( otávio augusto )  that deflowers her ,  and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience .  then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in amazonas and explored his owner ,  the despicable saraiva  ( antonio calloni )  .  when maria escapes to rio de janeiro expecting a better life ,  she is explored by the cáften vera  ( darlene glória )  .    " anjos do sol "  exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in brazil through the fate of the girl maria .  last year i saw  " lilja 4-ever "  that tells an identical story in the former soviet union ;  therefore this problem does exist in third world countries .  director and writer rudi lagemann presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes .  it is the debut of the promising fernanda carvalho ,  who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival .  most of the prostitutes are amateurs ,  and it is impossible to recognize the famous darlene glória so different she is after many plastic surgeries .  the bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic .  my vote is ten .   title  ( brazil )  :   " anjos do sol "   (  " angels of the sun "  ) 
another one of those films you hear about from friends  (  .  .  . or read about on imdb )  .  not many false notes in this one .  i could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a dead-end home town in tennessee to florida ,  with all her worldly possessions in an old beaten-up car .   the heroine ,  ruby ,  makes some false starts ,  but learns from them .  i found myself wondering why ,  why didn't she lean a bit more on mike's shoulder ,  but .  .  . she has her reasons ,  as it turns out .   just a fine film .  the only thing i don't much like about it ,  i think ,  is the title . 
in the sea of crap that hollywood  ( and others )  continue to put out ,  this is one of those diamonds in the rough .  a small ,  simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that you didn't just waste an hour and a half of your life .   ashley judd is really quite amazing in this movie .  i had never really been a fan or had noticed her before but going back and seeing this early performance of hers convinced me she's extremely talented .   watching this film was an assignment in a college course for me so i was skeptical i would even care .  i thought ,   " oh boy ,  some dumb chic flick or feminist male-bashing indie crap .  .  .  "  i was pleasantly surprised .  without analyzing the many relevant themes ,  i'll just say ,  if you haven't seen it ,  do yourself a favor and check it out .  sometimes the down-to-earth ,  slice-of-life movies are the best ,  and this is a great one . 
my brother brought this movie home from the rental store and i remember expecting it to be such a bore .  i think the title especially put me off .  i can't ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over .  i watched the movie twice before i let my brother take it back to the store .  it is very infrequent that a movie speaks to me the way this one did .  i was completely caught up in ruby's situation as she tries to make her way through her life .  the bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly .  i could have kept watching for hours .  another downside is that i have been unsatisfied with everything ashley judd has done since .  she is so perfect in this movie .  this film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time . 
victor nunez imbues this unsentimental tale of a young woman's emotional journey with a sense of poetry seldom seen in cinema .  by poetry i mean the sense in which the literary and the cinematic come into play .  there is something very literary about the film ,  almost as if a novel has been adapted page by page to screen .  in this sense ,  the film achieves depths many cannot ;  but it is also rather slow at other times ,  undercutting the depths it once achieved in favor of ennui .  the film's star ashley judd has not yet made a better film than her debut here .  she fits the role of lead ruby like a glove ,  almost as if she didn't have to act .  she has true movie star presence in the film ,  and hasn't really managed to convey the same allure in her later films ,  although she was impressive in normal life . 
this will be a different kind of review .  i've seen this movie twice on tv and would like to have a copy because it talks about panama city and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there .  it was the first movie i'd seen by ashley judd and she was great and i've enjoyed every other thing i've seen her in .  sundance's reaction made an impression on me too ,  as did the director ,  victor nunez ,  who has directed and written several movies about florida .  this movie speaks to me and i've seen nothing with which to compare it .  the plot speaks less to me than the surroundings .  well ,  i told you it would be a different kind of review . 
this was the first movie i ever saw ashley judd in and the first film of victor nunez' that i ever say ,  and boy am i glad i did .  its' quiet tone ,  its' relaxed pace ,  its' realistic depiction of a young woman just starting out in life ,  its' fine depiction of the struggles she has to go through to make her mark in life ,  the decisions she makes based on real things ,  the people she meets - there is nothing wrong with this movie .  it is as close to movie magic as i have ever seen outside of the  "  star wars  "  movies ,  and ,  given what those films are like ,  that means this film deserves a high rating indeed .  ashley judds' acting ,  mr .  nunez'writing ,  and its' great simple worthwhile story make this a fine coming-of-age story and a wonderful movie . 
 " ruby in paradise "  is a beautiful ,  coming-of-age story about a young woman ,  ruby lee gissing ,  escaping her stifling roots to become herself .  although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd -- in likely her first movie role ,  albeit one to be quite proud of -- the emphasis is not upon becoming  " somebody ,  "  a la the next madonna  ( whether jesus' mother or the lurid ,  attention-hungry singer )  .   it instead emphasizes following ones' instincts and being somewhat introspective about them ,  to grow into one's ideal ,  adult self .  note :  this isn't an action movie !  !  !  it uses an occasional voice-over narration  ( by ms .  judd )  while writing in her journal -- and oh ,  i see i've just lost the male half of the readers out there .  but be patient with this beautiful movie ,  where we learn that one's bliss can be discovered in -- oh ,  i dunno ,  carrying water and chopping wood .   actor/director/writer todd field ,  who played nick nightingale in  " eyes wide shut ,  "  co-stars as ruby lee's noble love interest ,  one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth .   but not even his character is the answer for ruby lee :  there's no external hero imposed upon her .  the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves .  writer/director victor nunez ,  who also wrote/directed  " ulee's gold ,  "  did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself -- confronting age-old challenges of good v .  evil along the way .   the supporting cast is also stellar ,  and the music used ,  particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips  ( whom i hear is the wife of t .  bone burnett )  ,  is right on -- most especially  " trying to hold on to the earth .  "  now ,  when i hear the first few chords of that song ,  tears spring to my eyes ,  pavlovian and unbidden -- not sure if it's the music ,  or the indelible connection to the movie's quiet ,  charming message of empowerment .   this movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his/her way .  for any woman of any age ,  it is a must see !  the downside :  it is not on dvd ,  except in spanish .   ( we learned ,  however ,  that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version ,  which can be readily found online .  my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me .  )  although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on-air  on an indie channel ,  usually  you can't count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world .  so buy a copy for yourself .   this movie should have a major re-release ,  and it would ,  if i were queen of hollywood .   -- figgy jones
i cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is .  suffice it to say ,  anytime i'm depressed about how unfair or futile things seem ,  this is the movie i go rent to put me in the right frame of mind .  the background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness .  the indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard ,  and is happy as a result .  persifina ,  the laundry co-worker of ruby's  ( ashley judd )  is another=-her eyes and smile could make the hardest person's day .  i watch this movie and i dream of better days to come or of a good conversation with friends ,  and i realize that being alone--ruby is alone quite often--isn't the same as being lonely .  recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful lull of a movie . 
very slow-paced ,  but intricately structured and ultimately very touching .  a nice ,  very true-to-life look at a small florida beach town in the dead of winter -- i've been there ,  and this is absolutely accurate .   it's also the debut feature of actress ashley judd ,  and she makes a big impression here .  it's hard to believe this film is 12 years old -- i remember seeing it in theaters ,  and i recently rented  " ruby "  again .  except for the 80's looking clothes ,  it has held up very nicely .  ashely is so radiant and touching here ,  that it's hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing .  boy ,  talk about failing to fulfill your early promise !  anyone seeing ashley here in  " ruby in paradise "  would assume this elegant ,  natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting -- instead she has become the  " go to "  girl for dumb action films and slasher movies !  very disappointing ,  but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise .   as some other commenter's say ,  this is not for everyone as it's very slow paced .  this is not an action film ,  nor is it really a romance .  the director  ( victor nunez ,   " ulees gold "  ,  another excellent character study )  treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect ,  allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail .  in that way ,  i think this is one of the most moving and respectful coming-of-age stories about young women that i can recall -- it's not about ruby's sexual awakening or  " how she lost her virginity "  ,  but about her life choices and her growing maturity .   a lovely film ,  if you take the time to watch it .  .  . i think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls  ( or boys for that matter )  and give them a chance to think about and discuss it .   particular kudos to director nunez ,  who also wrote the script ,  which is so realistic and nicely detailed that i assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female-written novel or memoir ,  but in fact it's mr .  nunez's original work .  rated 8 out of 10 . 
although i didn't like stanley & iris tremendously as a film ,  i did admire the acting .  jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie .  i haven't always been a fan of fonda's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time .  de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold .  he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can't care for him anymore that will break your heart .  i wouldn't really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment ,  but i will say you won't see much bette acting anywhere . 
i first saw this film when i was about 13 .  it blew me away then and in many respects it still does now .  but i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now .  there is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism - and thus fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it .  what we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one side ,  beko and woods in 3d panoramic rainbow vision - on the other ,  two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil .   this all makes for a great film story ,  but it worries me that people see the portrayal as 'accurate' . 
this movie is using cinematography fantastically ,  the depth of the camera catches each character .  denzel washington and kevin kline put on awesome performances though washingtons accent does die in certain scenes .  how is this movie laying forgotten ?  unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever .  a worrying idea .  attenborough at his best since ghandi ,  this master piece stands for what it should in movies such as these ,  no worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom in the south african apartheid . though critised for the biased nature ,  the movie is faithful to the book by donald woods and faithful to the message intended to express to the world .  ta and peace
i was electrified when i first saw this in 1983 or 1984 .  steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten .  i didn't when finally in south africa in 1993 .  it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty .  when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel' iafrika ,  my hair stood on its ends .  there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples . 
i have just finished watching this film in my gcse history class .  it was thrilling and was a brilliant insight to what actually happened to steve biko during the time of the apartheid law .  how anybody can say that this film was the most boring or dull 2 and a half hours of their lives i don't know because it had me hooked from start to finish .  it was great how denzel washington portrayed him and showed how he was fighting against the apartheid law and to get equal rights for black people .  in one part steve biko says to a policeman we are just as weak and human as you are ,  this is to show them that he and all of the other black people in south africa were no different to the whites .  donald woods inspired me because he fort for what he believed in and did not believe totally in apartheid .  he and steve biko formed a very strong friendship that shook south africa and went on to awaken the world .  i very much enjoyed this film and strongly recommend this to people .  it helped me see that racism is not right and that everybody is equal ,  their fate should not be determined by the colour of somebody's skin .  n
i keep watching this movie over and over and over .  i have to watch it at least once a week .  i am from africa and looking at that movie taught me some things that i didn't even know about africa .  denzel's movies are all full of lessons for people of walks of life .  i wish he was my own brother .  i have also seen and love your masala mississipi .  what a thrilling situation .  when denzel was trying to hook his brother up on the job ,  reminds me of my teen ages when my brother was always mad with me about getting myself busy all the time .  my brother was always caring for my old father and he wants to see me the same way too .  by the way where did denzel get that african accent from in the cry freedom movie ?  i have first seen that movie in africa and i didn't know then that denzel was american till i moved down here . 
i first watched this movie on its release in 1987 and was greatly affected emotionally ,  through a combination of guilt at what my fellow white human beings could do to innocent people and the reluctance of the outside world to really investigate these atrocities against man .   particularly moving was the funeral of steve biko ,  made even more vivid and hard-hitting by the south african anthem played at the time .  i have long believed that this movie achieved what nobody else had managed - to open the eyes of the world to what was really happening in south africa .  i consider myself to be a normal right thinking person and i can attest to how this film changed my whole way of thinking about not just south africa ,  but how we as white people perceive black people .  i have never seen any difference between people of any colour or creed ,  but after viewing this film i physically changed my life and have spent the last 17 years living in a predominantly black country and helping many people rise above their present standard of living and achieve that which they would not have thought possible .  the greatest reward i can honestly say i have received - to be able to say that in my own small way i have contributed and redressed the balance a little .  but if more people thought like me and actually did something to help black people without seeking reward then the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off .   i challenge any right thinking person to watch cry freedom from beginning to end and not feel that emotion tugging at your heartstrings as you witness the 700 schoolchildren brutally shot dead in sharpville for refusing to learn afrikaans ,  the senseless murder of steve biko ,  such a champion for his own people's rights ,  and then ,  ultimately ,  to understand that all this is not merely a film ,  albeit a magnificent one ,  but that it all actually happened and less than 30 years ago .   yes ,  my friends ,  watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard .  i couldn't .  i was too upset at knowing the truth .  that is the hallmark of a great film .  it was obviously the intention of sir richard attenborough to get this message over about south africa .  of course he has achieved it .  unless you happen to support apartheid .  god help you . 
 " cry freedom "  is not just a movie .  it is a historical account ,  heroic story ,  and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history .  not only does denzel washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating ,  determined hero ,  steve biko ,  but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of south arfrican apartheid .  the story of biko ,  an influential leader ,  and his main  " influencee "  ,  donald woods ,  is a heartbreaking one .  but ,  the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in south africa .   " cry freedom "  manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot .  it is because of great films like this one ,  that the public can become educated on terrible events in history ,  great leaders who sought to end them ,  and how we can never allow them to happen in the future .  because of this importance ,   " cry freedom "  is an amazing film that should be seen by all . 
the performance of every actor and actress  ( in the film )  are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be ;  and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again .  however ,  i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors' and director ,  attenborough's credits that puzzles me :  aren't they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent ,  long lasting film for the audience ?  i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one  ( possibly one of the  " knowledgeable "  personnel  ( insider )  of the film . 
i think the weighted average for this film is too low .  i give it a 7 .  very entertaining ,  although over the top in a few places .  my wife says it passes the danielle steele test .  superb performances throughout ,  particularly by andie macdowell . 
this is a film that everyone should watch .  quite apart from raising hugely important points  ( while south africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now )  ,  it is superbly directed while denzel washington gives ,  in my opinion ,  the best performance in his career so far .  kline also gives a good performance ,  although perhaps not as stunning as washington's .  john thaw also puts in a good turn as the chief of police .   there are so many possible areas where a film on apartheid could fall down ,  but all of these have been avoided .  it would be easy to simply portray white people as the bad guys and black people as the good guys ,  but attenborough has not done this .  sure ,  there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil ,  such as the captain at the soweto uprising ,  but to add extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long .  some people complain about the length of the film as it is ,  but i think it needs the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story ,  for it really is an incredible one .   the best scene in the film is that of steve biko's funeral .  when the whole crowd begins to sing the south african national anthem ,  it is probably one of ,  if not the most moving scenes i have seen .   if you haven't seen this film already :  watch it .  it may not be comfortable viewing ,  but it's certainly worth it . 
this film moved me beyond comprehension ,  it is and will remain my favourite film of all time ,  mainly because it has almost every emotion all rolled into its 157 minutes .  what is the hardest part for me to take is that whenever i want to hear the amazing music and songs from the film ,  i have to put it into my dvd player ,  so i was wondering if anyone anywhere knows who sings the songs in the film and where they can be found ,  as i have looked everywhere i can think sporadically over the past 5 years .  my favourite quote from the film is when in court the advocate says  " but your own words ask for direct confrontation ,  isn't that a direct call for violence ?  "  biko replies  " well you and i are in confrontation now ,  but i see no violence !  !  "   craig robertson fife ,  scotland
what is  " cry freedom "  like ?  it is simply great and unique experience about making of south africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people .  main character of the story is donald woods  ( kevin kline )  ,  chief editor of the newspaper daily dispatch in south africa .  woods writes several articles ,  where he speaks critically about views of steve biko  ( denzel washington )  .  soon woods meets biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in south africa  ( right from the top ,  even from the chief of police )  .  when biko dies in police custody ,  woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it .  but woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place ,  so world can find out the truth .   attenborough managed to make a good movie about people ,  with main message that black and white are the same ,  cause we are all people .  story leads us to south africa and this  ( movie )  is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and i'm disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie .  this is movie from which we all can learn something .  although it is a bit long ,  this story couldn't be presented in any shorter way because director wanted to show us how hard was for woods to get that book published after death of biko .    also relationship between woods and biko was shown great ,  just like families of those two people and all the problems they are going through .  but sometimes sacrifices must be made  ( biko's death )  so the truth could be reveled  ( woods book )  . 
even though it has one of the standard  " revenge price plots ,  "  this film is my favorite of vincent price's work .  gallico has that quality that is missing in so many horror film characters- likeability .  when you watch it ,  you feel for him ,  you feel his frustration ,  the injustices against him ,  and you cheer him on when he goes for vengeance ,  even though he frightens you a little with his original fury .  as the film goes on ,  his character becomes tragic .  he's committed his murder ,  but now he must kill to cover that up .  and again to cover that one up .  and again .  .  .  your stomach sinks with his soul as it goes down its spiral- like watching a beloved brother turn into a hood .  even if the revenge story is of old ,  the plot devices themselves are original- gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways .  a shame this one isn't available for home veiwing . 
steve biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority governed south africa in much the same way as gandhi tried to resist the british empire's colonialism in india .  richard attenborough's film cry freedom is not about biko or apartheid as much as it is about donald woods ,  the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell biko's story .  the film has a jarring point of view switch after biko dies in prison from tortuous behavior at the hands of south african  " police "  .  woods ,  played by kevin kline ,  must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books about biko or allow his wife ,  played by penelope wilton ,  to pressure him into forgetting about the books .  in that case ,  biko dies in vain .  what begins as a life-changing friendship between biko and woods degenerates into a standard by the numbers escape over the border yarn after biko's death .  oscar-nominated denzel washington is good in only his fourth film as biko ,  but something is wrong in a film that tries to depict the struggles of apartheid by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half the film .  attenborough would have served his topic better by focusing on biko's rise to prominence instead of beginning where biko befriended woods .  perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1/2 hour film wasn't exactly conducive to big box office ,  but the film was a tremendous box office flop anyway .  film politics aside ,  the film still entertains and sends a message or two ,  albeit ,  in pg-sanitized fashion .  *** of 4 stars . 
a long film about a very important character from south africa ,  stephen biko .  he is one of these blacks who did not survive apartheid ,  who actually died a long time before their normal time .  the already old film though does not show how important biko was ,  what he really represented .  his life and his teaching is reduced to little ,  at best a few witty remarks .  the film being from 1987 ,  the objective was to push south africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation .  so the film aims at showing how irrational the south african supporters of apartheid are ,  in 1987 .  to show this the film has to look beyond biko's death ,  hence to center its discourse not on biko but on a white liberal journalist and his escaping the absurd system in which he is living .  his escape is made necessary because of the victimization he is the victim of ,  along with his family ,  and because he wants to publish the first book on biko ,  after his death ,  and that can only happen in england .  the film shows a way to escape south africa ,  while apartheid is still standing and killing .  so do not expect this way to be realistic and true .  it could not be .  but the film has tremendously aged because it does not show south africa with any historical distantiation ,  the very distantiation that has taken place under nelson mandela's presidency and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out .  the film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today ,  especially since the film does not mention the third racial community ,  the indians .  panegyric books or films all have that defect :  they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view .  that explains why the film has aged so much ,  seems to be coming from so long ago ,  as if nothing had changed at all .  a remake is necessary .   dr jacques coulardeau ,  university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne ,  university versailles saint quentin en yvelines ,  cegid
it's a shame that this piece of work wasn't acknowledged as a piece of work .  it has everything a historical film must have :  a serious historical research ,  outstanding performances of every actor involved and a discrete but great direction .   when i saw the movie i knew it should be a prototype for every biographical movie . 
this is an absolutely incredible film .  it shows south african racism from the perspective of the victims ,  and provokes a feeling of anti-racism in everyone who sees it .  it is the best historic film i have ever seen . 
'cry freedom' is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth .   the first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist steve biko and editor don woods  ( played fanatically by dezel washington and kevin klein )  .  while the second half deals with woods looking for answers on biko's death .   although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between biko and woods' .  i found the second half about don woods struggle to have biko's story be heard around the world much more interesting . 
richard attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with the academy award winning 'gandhi' ,  back in '83 .  i didn't know of any other work of his till i recently came across 'cry freedom' ,  released back in 1987 .  while it may not have been as popular as his gandhi ,  it is every bit as gripping ,  if not more ,  and was released when south africa still had not got rid of the shackles of apartheid .  while most movies on social issues come out after the event had happened ,  i guess this one released during the time .   the story is based on real life characters and events .  the book on which the movie was based ,  was written by donald woods  ( kevin kline )  ,  a journalist who used to work in south africa until the end of the seventies .  it traces the origins of woods friendship with the charismatic black leader steve biko ,  who is wonderfully portrayed by denzel washington .  i cannot imagine a better choice for the role .  washington exudes a natural charm and screen presence ,  which biko's character required .   while initially ,  woods was against what he felt was black racism being spread by biko ,  after meeting the man ,  he could not help being drawn into his struggles and ideas .  the bond between them grows stronger ,  and woods and his family realise and become more sensitive to the plight of the people biko represents .   however ,  finally ,  tragedy strikes ,  and woods must now concentrate on escaping from south africa ,  with his book ,  so that he can get it published and let the outside world know what is going on .  the second half of the movie is a gripping tale of his escape from south africa ,  along with his family ,  and will keep you on tenterhooks .   there are some deliciously humorous dialogues too .  the scene between biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example .   lawyer :  do you advocate violence ?  biko :  i advocate a confrontation .  lawyer :  well ,  isn't that violence ,  mr .  biko ?  biko :  not necessarily .  you and i are having a confrontation now ,  but i don't see any violence .   however ,  there are moments that bring you back to the horrors that pervaded the country before better sense prevailed .  the scene where the army opens fire on a protest by school children is gut wrenching and heartbreaking .   this is definitely a must watch .  i would suggest those not familiar with attenborough's work ,  do take time out for this .  there are movies which make a lot of money .  and there are movies which make lives .  i would any day prefer the latter . 
what a brilliant film .  i will admit it is very ambitious ,  with the subject matter .  at a little over two and a half hours ,  it is a very long film too .  but neither of these pointers are flaws in any way .  cry freedom ,  despite the minor flaws it may have ,  is a powerful ,  moving and compelling film about the story of the black activist steve biko in his struggles to awaken south africa to the horrors of the apartheid .  it is true ,  that the first half is stronger than the second in terms of emotional impact .  people have also complained that the film suffers from too much woods not enough biko .  i may be wrong ,  but although it is biko's story ,  it is told in the perspective of woods ,  so woods is an important character in conveying biko's story to the world .   cry freedom visually looks amazing .  with the show-stopping cinematography and the stunning south african scenery it was a visual feast .  the opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot .  george fenton's music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes .  it was subtle in scenes in the second half ,  but stirring and dramatic in the crowd scenes .  the script was of exceptional quality ,  the courtroom scenes with biko were enough to really make you think wow this is real quality stuff .  the first half with biko as the main focus constantly had something to feel emotional about ,  whether it was the police's attack of the south african citizens or biko's death .  the second half entirely about donald woods carries less of an emotional punch ,  but is compensated by how it is shot ,  performed and written .  and there are parts that are genuinely suspenseful as well .    the performances were exceptional from the entire cast ,  from the most minor character to the two leads ,  there wasn't a single bad performance .  regardless of the accents that is ,  but it is forgiven so easily by how much the performances draw you in .  denzel washington in one of his more understated performances ,  gives a truly compelling performance as biko ,  and kevin kline shows that he can be as good at drama as he is at comedy ,  for he gave a suitably subtle performance to match that of washington's .  and the two men's chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note .  penelope wilton is lovely as donald's wife wendy ,  and she is a great actress anyway .  out the supporting performances ,  and there may be some bias ,  two stood out for me .  one was timothy west ,  who relishes his role as captain dewet .  the other was the ever exceptional john thaw in a brilliantly chilling cameo-role as kruger .  lord richard attenborough's direction is focused and constantly sensitive as usual .   overall ,  a truly wonderful film .  ambitious and long it is ,  but never ceases to be compelling ,  powerful and achingly moving .  a definite winner from lord richard attenborough ,  and worthy of a lot more praise .  10/10 bethany cox
i think the context of the story has been covered by other posters so i would just like to write about the impact this film had on me .   i first saw this film the year of it's release around 1987 .  my school organised a trip to the cinema to see it ,  for an re project i think .  we all went along of course excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema !  little did we know what we were about to experience .  to this day i still remember the feelings it invoked in me and i remembered crying a lot as were most of my friends .  i think at the age we were we found it shocking and quiet rightly outraged in our own youthful way  . it had such an impact on me that i joined the anti apartheid movement the same year .   i think it served it's purpose in my case . 
what a movie !  i never imagined richard attenborough could have such a movie in him .  gandhi has always left me indifferent ,  apart from ben kingsley's performance ,  and i never considered attenborough a particularly good filmmaker .  but cry freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times .  it's an exciting ,  mesmerizing political movie with great performances by kevin kline and a young denzel washington .   kline plays donald woods ,  a south africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights activist steve biko .  it starts as a difficult friendship ,  for woods sees biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites .  but biko ,  with his kind words ,  upbeat attitude and complete transparency ,  wins over woods and introduces him to a reality about apartheid that woods knew nothing about .   biko is a decent ,  law-abiding citizen who altruistically stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people .  one night ,  coming from an illegal meeting ,  he's arrested and beaten to death .  the authorities try to hush up the matter because biko has become a huge personality in south africa .  but through the efforts of woods the truth comes out .  but what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as woods and his family become targets for the secret police .   this movie has an interesting structure .  it has in fact two narratives :  first it narrates the life and death of biko .  it's an amazing first half ,  completely dominated by the charisma of washington in what may be his greatest performance yet .   the second half ,  no less interesting ,  narrates woods attempt to escape from south africa to publish a book about biko .  woods has become an enemy of state ,  a banned person ,  which means he can't meet people or leave his country .  plus he's constantly spied by the police .  kevin kline gives a great performance in this second half too .   although the first half is quite straightforward ,  the second does interesting things with editing ,  by giving flashbacks of biko and of events that show the repression against the black south africans .  some may argue this is to make it more interesting ,  but for me the second half just as captivating ,  as woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape south africa .   the last minutes were so heartbreaking i was in tears .  george fenton and jonas gwangwa's score certainly had something to do with it .  although i've never been much of a fan of fenton  ( cannot stand his gandhi score )  ,  i do think the score for cry freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema .  the movie ,  thanks to the music married to the powerful images ,  at times reached incredible peaks of emotion .   cry freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of denzel washington .  this is a movie to be cherished in its entirety .  acting ,  writing ,  music ,  editing ,  cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit .  this movie deserve a place alongside movies like the pianist ,  life is beautiful and the shawshank redemption . 
 " crush "  examines female friendship ,  for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme  ( e .  g .  ,   " steel magnolias "  )  .  at the same time ,  it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise .  the events depicted were highly improbable ,  but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me .  not a film for the speeding-vehicle-and-explosion crowd ,  but grown-up women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears . 
 " the true story of the friendship that shook south africa and awakened the world .  "    richard attenborough ,  who directed  " a bridge too far "  and  " gandhi "  ,  wanted to bring the story of steve biko to life ,  and the journey and trouble that journalist donald woods went through in order to get his story told .  the films uses wood's two books for it's information and basis -  " biko "  and  " asking for trouble "  .   the film takes place in the late 1970's ,  in south africa .  south africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid ,  which keeps the blacks separated from the whites and classifies the whites as the superior race .  the blacks are forced to live in shantytowns on the outskirts of the cities and towns ,  and they come under frequent harassment by the police and the army .  we are shown a dawn raid on a shantytown ,  as bulldozers and armed police force their way through the camp beating and even killing the inhabitants .  then we are introduced to donald woods  ( kevin kline )  ,  who is the editor of a popular newspaper .  after publishing a negative story about black activist steve biko  ( denzel washington )  ,  woods goes to meet with him .  the two are wary of each other at first ,  but they soon become good friends and biko shows the horrors of the apartheid system from a black persons point of view to woods .  this encourages woods to speak out against what's happening around him ,  and makes him desperate to bring steve biko's story out of the clutches of the white man's south africa and to the world .  soon ,  steve biko is arrested and is killed in prison .  now woods and his family are daring to escape from south africa to england ,  where woods can publish his book about steve biko and the apartheid .   when i first heard of  " cry freedom "  ,  i was under the impression that it was a movie completely dedicated to the life of steve biko .  i had never actually heard of steve biko before i seen this film ,  as the events in this film were really before my time .  but it's more about the story of donald woods and his journey across the border into lesotho as he tried to elude the south african officials .  woods was put on a five year type house arrest after steve biko was killed .  so in order to publish his manuscript on steve biko ,  he had to escape .  because the manuscript would be considered treason in south africa and that could have resulted in woods meeting a fate similar to that of biko's .  the real donald woods and his wife acted as consultants to this film .   denzel washington is only in the film for the first hour ,  and i was disappointed with that as i was expecting to see him for the entire movie .  but he was amazing as steve biko ,  and captured his personality from what i've read really well and his accent sounded perfect .  his performance earned him an oscar nomination for best supporting actor .  kevin kline delivers a excellent and thought-evoking performance as donald woods ,  and penelope wilton is excellent as his wife wendy .   filming took place in zimbabwe ,  as needless to say problems arose when they tried to film it in south africa .  while in south africa ,  the south african gestapo followed the film crew everywhere ,  so they got the bad vibes and they pulled out and went to neighbouring zimbabwe instead .  despite everything ,  and the fact that the apartheid didn't end 'til seven years later ,   " cry freedom "  wasn't banned in south africa .  but cinemas showing the movie received bomb threats .   richard attenborough brings the horrors of the apartheid to the screen with extreme force and determination .  he doesn't hold back at the end of the movie when showing what was supposed to be a peaceful protest by students in a shantytown ,  turns into a massacre when police open fire on them .  the film ends with the names of all the anti-apartheid movers who died in prison ,  and the explanations for their deaths .  many had  " no explanation "  .  quite a few were  " epilepsy "  ,  which is hard to believe ,  and many more either fell from the top of the stairs or were  " suicide from hanging "  .  no one will ever know what really happened to them ,  but i think it's fair to say that none of these men died at their own hands ,  but at the hands of others ;  or to be more precise ,  at the hands of the police .     " cry freedom "  is a must-see movie for it's portrayal and story of steve biko .  it's also a searing and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the hellish grips of racial segregation and violence . 
very rarely does denzil washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for kevin kline and in this case  ,  this must count as one of their best films .  it is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of steve biko although we do get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend donald woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt  ,  putrid society south africa was .  the direction is outstanding from david attenborough as it was for gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film .  two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie  . what is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras .  thousands of people in both films .  this film really does open your eyes to what happened before the break up of aparthiet and you cannot fail to moved by it .  8 out of 10 . 
it's sad to view this film now that we know how the anc got shafted by international capitalism .  biko died for nothing much .  woods achieved little .  yes ,  outright apartheid was abolished ,  but all the apparatus of power was reserved by the minority whites ,  leaving the anc government more or less impotent .  as naomi klein writes in the shock doctrine ,  in the talks between the black and white leaderships  " the deklerk government had a twofold strategy .  first drawing on the ascendant washington consensus that there was no only one way to run an economy ,  it portrayed key sectors of economic decision making --- such as trade policy and the central bank --- as  " technical "  or  " adminsitrative "  .  then it used a wide range of new policy tools --- international trade agreements ,  innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs --- to hand control of those power centres to supposedly impartial experts ,  economists and officials from the imf ,  the world bank ,  the gatt and the national party --- anyone except the liberation fighters from the anc .  "  the statistical results are horrifying ,  with not much change accomplished ,  and aids flourishing .  viewing cry freedom in this light is deeply ironic --- actually tragic .  the anc has transformed itself from being the solution to being the primary problem . 
an overlong ,  but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader steve biko and donald woods .  the first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men ,  and how they help each other out ,  but the second half isn't as strong ,  due to the elimination of the biko character .  still ,  its a compelling film with great performances by kline and washington ,  in the film that put the latter on the map .  washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time .  overall ,  a well made film that could have been trimmed down a bit .  7/10 . ____________________________________
as anyone old enough knows ,  south africa long suffered under the vile ,  racist oppression of apartheid ,  which completely subjugated the black population .  one of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was steve biko ,  who was murdered in jail .  following the murder ,  reporter donald woods sought to get biko's message out to the world .   in  " cry freedom "  ,  woods  ( kevin kline )  befriends biko  ( denzel washington )  before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges .  when woods attempts to spread biko's word ,  he and his family begin living under threat of attack ,  and they are finally forced to flee the country .  the last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters .   as one of two movies  ( along with  " a world apart "  )  that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement ,   " cry freedom "  stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved . 
cry freedom is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheid's cruelty in just a couple of hours .  famed director richard attenborough  ( gandhi )  is certainly no stranger to the genre ,  and the collaboration of the real-life mr .  and mrs .  woods ,  the main white characters in their book and in this film ,  lends further authenticity to cry freedom .  the video now in release actually runs a little over 2 and a half hours since 23 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part tv miniseries after the film's initial theatrical release .  while the added length serves to heighten the film's forgivable flaws :  uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular ,  another possible flaw  ( the insistence on the white characters' fate over that of the african ones )  may work out as a strength .  viewing crying freedom as a politically and historically educational film  ( as i think it should ,  over its artistic merits )  ,  the story is one which black africans know only too well ,  though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact .  it is the whites who have always been the film's and the book's target audience ,  hopefully driving them to change .  now twelve years after the movie's production ,  cry freedom is in many ways a more interesting film to watch .  almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place ,  1987's cry freedom's ideals remain by and large unrealized .  it therefore remains as imperative as ever for white south africans ,  particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it ,  and absorb the film's messages .  in total contrast to american slavery and the jewish holocaust's exposure ,  south africans' struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories :  cry freedom ,  cry the beloved country  ( ok ,  count it twice if you include the remake )  ,  and sarafina  ( did i miss one ?  )  .  all three dramas also clumsily feature american and british actors in both the white and black roles .  not one south african actor has played a major role ,  white ,  coloured ,  indian or black !  )  .  and yes i did miss another international south african drama ,  mandela and deklerk .  though this  ( also highly recommended )  biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted ,  mandela was played by a black american  ( sidney poitier ,  who also starred in the original s . a . -themed cry the beloved country )  ,  while the afrikaner deklerk was played by a  ( bald )  very british michael caine ,  a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of afrikanerdom is vehement anti-british feelings .  until local sabc tv and african films start dealing with their own legacy ,  cry freedom is about as authentic as you'll get .  as villified as the whites  ( particularly the afrikaners )  are portrayed in the film ,  any observant  ( non-casual )  visitor to south africa even now in 1999 ,  not to mention 1977 when cry freedom takes place ,  will generally find white's attitudes towards blacks restrained ,  even understated .  looking at cry freedom in hindsight ,  it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all ,  and it is .  but cry freedom at time shows not much has really changed in many people's minds yet ,  and that the black africans' goal to freedom and reconciliation is still ongoing .  this is why if you're a novice to the situation ,  cry freedom ,  is your best introduction . 
billed as the story of steve biko -- played excellently by denzel washington ,  as you'd expect -- this was actually more the story of donald woods ,  played by kevin kline .   this was undoubtedly the making of kline as a serious actor ,  and he was surprisingly good in the role .   attenborough gave this the sort of direction you'd expect ,  and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the sort that only he can get across .   the remainder of the cast was competent enough and did a good job ,  in what ends up as an ultimately sad tale of a south africa that is still nowhere near the distant past . 
this film is ,  quite simply ,  brilliant .  the cinematography is good ,  the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking .  this is the story of donald woods ,  a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid .  kevin kline is completely convincing - so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later ,  i recognised him from kline's portrayal .  denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance ,  as ever .   i urge you to watch this .  it is long ,  but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story .  remember ,  folks ,  this really happened . 
i show this film to university students in speech and media law because its lessons are timeless :  why speaking out against injustice is important and can bring about the changes sought by the oppressed .  why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential to democracy .  this is a must-see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the activism of steven biko and the journalism of donald woods .  it also gives an important lesson of free speech :   " you can blow out a candle ,  but you can't blow out a fire .  once the flame begins to catch ,  the wind will blow it higher .  "   ( from biko by peter gabriel ,  on shaking the tree )  . 
great battle finale and nice sets help keep this often-slow movie enjoyable .  at times it had me checking my watch ,  although there were enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it .  the ending should surprise even those familiar with the nibelungen story line . 
this is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small england town .  one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor ,  when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever .  definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you !  a powerful piece of work .  this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time .   *spoiler !  !  !  spoiler alert !  !  spoiler !  ! *  the main character is taken by her young ,  handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms .  her two jealous  " friends "  play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy .  she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop .  in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together .  ( in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted ) 
in  " die nibelungen :  siegfried "  ,  siegfried was betrayed .  now ,  kriemhild seeks revenge .  she marries hagen ,  and through a series of events ,  finally engages in a very drastic  ( but fitting )  action at the end .   one of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals .  attila the hun  ( called etzel in the movie )  is shown as the strange person from the east ,  possibly an allusion to the soviet union .  obviously ,  it was not fritz lang's fault that hitler used  " the nibelungenlied "  for german national pride in the third reich ,  but one can see what the fuhrer liked about the story .  nonetheless ,  this is an absolutely formidable movie . 
the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is  " beauty "  .  beauty is all around ,  in actors' play  ( andie is superb as always )  ,  in well designed shots ,  and in authors' red line idea - the love .   i think the kenny's character is the only white spot in these three womens' otherwise boring and predictable life .  his interaction makes andie's character living as entertaining as it could possibly be .  when he's gone ,  it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desires .   the fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad ,  instead it shows that life prevails in any forms ,  even in this small british village ,  which is shown perfectly .   another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways - all that houses and  " fags "  and accents  :  )  )  )  .  and andie again is doing superb job !  it is a shame that this movie got such low marks .  10 out of ten ! 
fritz lang's german medieval saga continues in die nibelungen :  kriemhilds rache  ( 1924 )  . kriemhild  ( margarete schoen )  wants to avenge her murdered husband ,  siegfried . her brother is too weak to bring the murdered ,  hagen ,  to justice . kriemhild marries etzel ,  the king of the huns  ( rudolf klein-rogge )  . she gives birth to a child ,  and invites her brothers for a party . etzel and the other huns should kil hagen ,  but he is protected by his brothers . we see a huge battle of life and death begins ,  and she sets the whole place on fire . eventually hagen is dead ,  and so is kriemhild . these movies deal with great themes ,  such as revenge and undying love . sure we have later seen some better movies made of those topics ,  but this was one of the early ones . 
i finally got my wish to see this one in a cinema .  i'd seen fritz lang's film on video some years ago .  i'd been hoping that ideal screening conditions would work their magic .   conditions were ideal at cinematheque ontario .  pristine full-length print .  intertitles in the original gothic-script german with simultaneous english translation ,  accurate without being too literal .  live piano accompaniment .  ideal .   the film's magic sputtered for a little while but ultimately failed to catch ,  at least for me .   this film bears no real relation to wagner's ring cycle as i already knew but some may not .  wagner had adapted the 13th c .  niebelungenlied to his own purposes .  part i of fritz lang's epic --  " siegfried "  -- has much that will be familiar to listeners of wagner however .    " kriemhild's revenge "  is the story of siegfried's wife kriemhild ,  her marriage to king etzel  ( attila )  the hun ,  and her desire for revenge against hagen and gunther ,  the rechristened nibelungs ,  for the murder of siegfried .  the spectacular conflagration in this film presumably evolved and expanded in the wagnerian mythos into his götterdämmerung ,  his twilight of the gods ,  and the end of valhalla .  this film remains earthbound .   most of the film is spectacular .  the massive sets rival those of  " cabiria "   ( 1914 )  ,  which inspired griffith's  " intolerance "   ( 1916 )  .  their decoration sets a new benchmark in barbaric splendour .  there's a huge cast of scarred ,  mangy huns and art deco burgundians .  and battles .  battles that never seem to end in fact .   kriemhild is very successful in her plan of revenge .  she manages to destroy all around her .  her loyalty to her martyred siegfried seems not to stem so much from love ,  or devotion ,  but from something closer to psychosis .  lady macbeth cried out ,   " unsex me here .  "  she knew she was emotionally unprepared for what she needed to do .  but kriemhild displays no normal human emotions ,  and certainly nothing one equates with the feminine principle .  she is already  " top full of direst cruelty "  ,  to borrow shakespeare's phrase ,  from the outset .  margarethe schön and her director convey this with a glower .  i don't want to exaggerate ,  but that glower is virtually the only expression ever to  " animate "  kriemhild's face .  it's the ultimate in one-note performances .  it's clearly intentional however ,  not simply a case of poor acting .   what we have then on offer is a one-dimensional sketch of an avenging fury .  some might see kriemhild as an empowered heroine .  i just see the film as misogynistic . 
in some ways ,  the wrath of kriemhild surpasses siegfried's death ,  but it also loses some of that film's greatness .  the plot of this one is more cohesive than the first ,  which is quite amazing .  the second half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through ,  until ,  that is ,  you get to the climactic battle scenes ;  only the iliad's are better .  lang and harbou embellished the huns .  the poet-compiler of the nibelungenlied didn't know a hun from his right ball ,  and as a result they are ,  more or less ,  the same as the burgundians in custom .  for example ,  although the poet clearly describes etzel as a heathen  ( which is kriemhild's main concern as rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him )  ,  when she gets to hunland ,  the first thing she does is go to mass .  the huns here are clearly heathens ;  they're almost like caveman .  the depiction of them is hilarious ,  especially verbal ,  the jester ,  who has two marvelous scenes .  etzel's character has been given more weight .  he is much more formidable .  all he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem .  lang and harbou are masterful at building suspense ,  especially at the banquet scene ,  which is intercut with verbal's second performance to an amazing effect .  however ,  as is the nature of this half of the poem ,  the film's amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one ,  for the most part ,  except for a dazzling sequence where etzel's hall burns down with the nibelungs inside .  the one thing i do have to object to is the way harbou changes the ending .  spoilers :  in the poem ,  after hildebrand captures hagen and gunther ,  they are imprisoned .  kriemhild visits hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde .  he refuses and she herself decapitates her brother .  when hagen still refuses ,  she decapitates him .  hildebrand  ( or possibly dietrich )  is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he ,  in turn ,  decapitates her ,  calling her a  " devil woman "  .  etzel ,  who is much weaker in the poem than he is here ,  says something silly like :   " ah me !  "  i can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as hildebrand brings them from the castle ;  to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic .  i also understand why they didn't have hildebrand kill kriemhild :  his character is much reduced here ;  his name is only mentioned once .  but ,  to have kriemhild kill herself ,  adopting brynhild's death from the icelandic sources ,  is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them .  the point of the poem is that kriemhild's wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil .  here ,  we simply have her die for her lost love .  it's not as interesting . 
please see also my comment on die nibelungen part 1 :  siegfried .   the second part of ufa studio's gargantuan production of the nibelungen saga continues in the stylised ,  symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor .  however ,  whereas part one was a passionless portrayal of individual acts of heroism ,  part two is a chaotic depiction of bloodletting on a grand scale .   as in part one ,  director fritz lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm ,  with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands .  these pictures should only be watched with the note-perfect gottfried huppertz score ,  which fortunately is on the kino dvd .  now ,  with this focus on mass action ,  lang is presented with greater challenges in staging .  the action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed ,  but now he simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow ,  with the level of activity on the screen swelling up like an orchestra .   but just as part one made us witness siegfried's adventures matter-of-factly and without excitement ,  part two presents warfare as devastating tragedy .  in both pictures ,  there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters .  that's why lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action ,  never allowing us to feel as if we are there  ( and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of lang's work )  .  that's also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical ,  with the actors lurching around like constipated sleepwalkers .   nevertheless ,  kriemhild's revenge does constantly deal with emotions ,  and is in fact profoundly humanist .  the one moment of naturalism is when atilla holds his baby son for the first time ,  and lang actually emphasises the tenderness of this scene by building up to it with the wild ,  frantic ride of the huns .  the point is that lang never manipulates us into taking sides ,  and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the wagner opera .  the climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene .  why then did hitler and co .  get so teary-eyed over it ,  a fact which has unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films ?  because the unwavering racial ideology of the nazis made them automatically view the nibelungs as the good guys ,  even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin .  for hitler ,  their downfall would always be a nationalist tragedy ,  not a human one .   but for us non-nazi viewers ,  what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of pageantry and musical rhythm .  when you see these fully-developed silent pictures of lang's ,  it makes you realise how much he was wasted in hollywood .  rather than saddling him with low-budget potboilers ,  they should have put him to work on a few of those sword-and-sandal epics ,  pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally ,  where it's the poetic ,  operatic tonality that sweeps us along . 
i saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in nürnberg ,  and it was superb .  i do have to admit that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion/xylophone player influenced the mood of the film ,  but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the tragic nibelungen saga .   if you are interested in silent films or in the nibelungenlied ,  i highly recommend this film .  the costumes were fantastic and creative ,  the sets were opulent and exotic ,  and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking  ( as is typical of silent film  " tragedies "  )  unfortunately ,  i have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns siegfried .  the story of this second film begins after siegfried's death ,  when kremhild  ( gudrun in the norse versions of the story )  begins to plan her revenge against her brothers .   also ,  i watched this film in german ;  i am a native english speaker and have a basic german knowledge .  it was difficult to read the  ? subtitles  ( what do you call that in silent films ?  )  at first because of the old style german script ,  so i advise that if you watch it in german that you make sure you can differentiate your  " k's "  ,   " f's "  ,  and  " s's "  in the old script .   :  ) 
canto 1 :  how kriemhild mourned over siegfried and how king attila woos her through his ambassador rüdiger von bechlarn :  kriemhild  ( margarete schön )  insists on having the head of the killer of her beloved husband ,  hagen tronje  ( hans adalbert schlettow )  ,  but her brother ,  king gunther  ( theodor loos )  ,  refuses her request .  when king attila of the huns woos kriemhild through his ambassador rüdiger von bechlar ,  she makes him promise through oath in the name of his king that no man would ever offend her .  hagen tronje hides the nibelungen treasure in the bottom of a lake .   canto 2 :  how kriemhild takes leave from her homeland and how she was received by king attila :  kriemhild brings some earth from where siegfried died ,  and travels to the court of the huns ,  where she is welcomed by attila himself ,  who also promises through oath to defend her .   canto 3 :  how king attila besieged rome and how kriemhild summoned her brothers :  when kriemhild delivers a baby boy ,  attila returns to his realm and asks kriemhild what she would like most to please her .  she asks him to invite her brothers to come to his kingdom .   canto 4 :  how kriemhild receives her brothers :  kriemhild insists on having the head of hagen tronje ,  but her brothers keep loyalty to their friend and again do not accept her request .   canto 5 :  how the huns celebrated the summer solstice with the nibelungen :  kriemhild asks attila to kill hagen tronje ,  but he refuses since in accordance with the laws of the desert ,  a guest is considered sacred .  kriemhild offers gold to the hums for the head of hagen tronje .  there is a fight ,  and hagen tronje kills attila's son .   canto 6 :  the nibelungen's distress :  the huns lose the battle against the nibelungen ,  but keep them under siege inside attila's castle .  kriemhild promises to spare their lives provided they deliver hagen tronje ,  but her brother gunther tells that german people are loyal with their friends .   canto 7 :  the nibelungen's end :  after the death of rüdiger von bechlarn ,  giselher and gernot ,  hagen tronje and guhther are finally captured .  kriemhild kills hagen tronje ,  ending her revenge with the destruction of the nibelungen .   the conclusion of the poetic saga of siegfried through  " kriemhild's revenge "  is also told through seven dramatic cantos .  the nature of the first part is a magnificent tale of fantasy ,  adventure ,  romance and betrayal ;  the second part is a dramatic story of hate ,  revenge and loyalty .  the solid screenplay with a perfect development of the characters ,  the excellent performances of the cast and the awesome direction of fritz lang produced another epic ahead of time .  margarete schön is impressive with a total different woman ,  obsessed and inflexible in her revenge wish .  the costumes that kriemhild wears are also very impressive ,  and her acting is based on her face and look .  i was a little disappointed with the reaction of attila after the death of his only son ,  since i found it too passive .  my vote is eight .   title  ( brazil )  :   " os nibelungos  parte ii :  a vingança de kriemshild "   (  " the nibelungen part ii :  kriemhild's revenge "  ) 
after repeated listenings to the cd soundtrack ,  i knew i wanted this film ,  got it for christmas and i was amazed .  marc bolan had such charisma ,  i can't describe it .  i'd heard about him in that way ,  but didn't understand what people were talking about until i was in the company of this footage .  he was incredible .  clips from the wembley concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches such as nuns gorging themselves at a garden party as marc bolan performs some acoustic versions of get it on ,  etc .   ( i'm still learning the song titles )  .  george claydon ,  the diminutive photographer from magical mystery tour ,  plays a chauffeur who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors .  nothing i can say to describe it would spoil it ,  even though i put the spoilers disclaimer on this review ,  so you would just need to see this for yourselves .  it evades description .    yes ,  i love the beatles and was curious about ringo directing a rock documentary - that was 35 years ago - now ,  i finally find out it's been on dvd for 2 years ,  but it's finally in my home .  it's an amazing viewing experience - even enthralling .    now the dvd comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste from another user :    there's two hidden extras on the born to boogie double dvd release .    1 . from the menu on disc one , select the bonus material and goto the extra scenes 2 . on the extra scenes page goto scene 42 take 1 and keep pressing left 3 . when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a  " star+1972 "  logo appears 4 . press enter   5 . from the main menu on disc two , select the sound options 6 . on the sound options page goto the 90/25  ( i think thats right )  option and keep pressing left 7 . when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a  " star+home video "  logo appears 8 . press enter
if you're a t-rex/marc bolan fan ,  i recommend you check this out .  it shows a whimsical side of marc bolan as well as ringo starr ,  apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that aren't part of the concert ,  but fun to watch ,  leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people ,  and when the concert is shown a talented musician ,  both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls .  watching him in concert ,  you would never know that being a rock star is a job ,  but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends ,  like elton john and ringo starr appearing in some of the live performances .  true ,  there are a few songs missing that i would like to have seen on there ,  but like any album it can't have everything .  i just bought this in 2006 ,  but if i would have know it came out in 1972 ,  i would have definitely bought it years ago .  sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars ,  would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash ! 
panned by critics at the time but loved by the fans ,  this film has now become a classic .  mixing supposedly 'surreal' footage shot at john lennon's home among other places with live footage of marc bolan & t . rex at their very best ,  this film is not just a must for everyone who's liked marc bolan but gives a fascinating insight into the era .   these were the times when marc was hobnobbing with the likes of ringo starr of the beatles [who directed it] and you can even find a brief spot from one reg dwight [elton john to you] bashing the ivories in an amazing [and never officially released] version of tutti frutti and rocking and ballad versions of children of the revolution .   there's also wonderful scenes featuring chelita secunda [said to have 'created glam rock' with her use of glitter etc] ,  mickey finn and even the actor from catweazle !  !   the best scene for me is in the garden when marc leaves the dining table ,  sits down cross-legged in front of a string section and knocks out acoustic versions of classics such as get it on and the slider .   highly ,  highly recommended !  !  five stars [out of five] .   rory
born to boogie is a real 'find'--though a rock fan for nearly thirty years ,  i only first saw the film a few days ago ,  and rank it among the top rock films of all time ;  the music's terrific  ( the cream of t .  rex )  and the visuals consistently exciting and unusual ,  leaving this viewer craving any more past directorial efforts of ringo starr ,  who did a fine job here .  if you love the music ,  you'll be in t .  rextasy throughout ,  as marc bolan really is the star of the piece ,  front and center .  even the fact that some songs are repeated doesn't matter a bit :  different venues ,  costuming ,  musical arrangements ,  and bizarre visual concepts are all used to lend different textures and a great deal of upbeat humor to what could have ended up as 'only' a concert film in other hands .  as rich and full packed as born to boogie is ,  the film's only about an hour long ,  but what is there is totally satisfying .  therein lies my only criticism--the video package states something like 71 minutes ,  and at least one online source claims the film to be 67 minutes ,  but apparently it's more like 61 minutes of rocking fun . 
well ,  i thoroughly enjoyed this movie .  it was funny and sad and yes ,  the guy andie macdowell shagged was hot .  interesting ,  realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery .  i think my mum would like it .  i still think they should have been allowed to call it the sad f**kers club though .  .  . 
this is indeed a treat for every bolan fan ,  some might think that it's a little over the top ,  and that it is only about ringo and marc's egos ,  but i think it's similar to any other concert video ,  except for the fact that this is marc bolan ,  not just any guy !  i especially liked the music video for children of the revolution ,  with elton john and ringo starr .  this clip alone is worth all the money ,  i can't believe they did'not release this version as the single .  the movie is really superb ,  especially for us danes .  now ,  i wasn't alive during the 70's .  but danes in general was totally shot out from what was happening around them .  the media didn't play or show any of the popular music back then ,  including marc bolan and t . rex ,  they only played a little with the doors ,  only the really popular songs though .  so ,  i know from my dad ,  that seeing this ,  gives him back a part of his youth ,  he never got to experience .   i wont make this too long ,  so .  .  .  if you're the least bit fan of marc bolan ,  you need to see this .  you might find it boring or as said before ,  a little over the top .  but at least you've seen one of the best musicians ever ,  in action !   only thing that disappoints me a little ,  is that ride a white swan isn't on the tape .  but i forgive it ,  since jeepster and get it on are so wonderfully played . 
so halfway through the season ,  i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through ,  which is crap .   i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on dvd later .  maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season .   i loved the show and looked forward to it every thursday after the oc .  can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared ?  needless to say ,  i'm not very happy with fox right now .  even more so after discovering that no ending was filmed .  i mean ,  if you're going to work on a project ,  at least finish it to see what happens .  a half filmed show is like a half made car ,  it's pretty much useless .  fox ,  film the damn ending and give some of the show's fans some peace . 
i can't believe that they took this off the air .  especially ,  when they only had a few more episodes left .  my daughter ,  sister and a few of my friends loved watching this show .  we were so upset when they stopped showing this because of so called ratings .  it is not fair to the people who were watching this show since the beginning .  we had a right to see the end .  i wish they would take an overall vote from all people with a 3 times a year voting system .  they could send out papers in the mail and we as viewers could give an overall vote on all programs that we watch or have heard about .  this could also help promote a new show .  people would see it and wonder what it is .  not only could you see what the viewers are watching ,  you could also use this as a tool for free advertisement for tv and cable channels .  we want to see the other episodes .  bring it back !  ! 
i really love this show ,  it's like reading a book and each chapter leaves you wanting more .  it gets you thinking about what is going to happen in the next episode ,  and the struggle of trying to maintain their friendship throughout the years .  after each episode ends it leaves a sweet bitter taste in your mouth knowing that :  one - the show was good ,  you can't wait for the next episode and it really gets you thinking about what actually happens to the friends throughout the twenty years .  and two - the fact that the show has been put  " on hiatus "  and we will not see the show finish in it's entirety .  fox obviously do not know what they have done ,  they claim that they are losing viewers in the 18 - 49 category they clearly do not know what people want to see if they got rid of a good show such as  " reunion "  .  i have one query though that i would like to raise .  if they were to bring the show back and it went on for another season how would it work since each episode is done in the period of a year and the story is based on what happens in the span of twenty years ?  your answers are most welcome .  bring back reunion !  bring back reunion ! 
so ,  fox pulled the plug midway through a drama/mystery .  .  .   how lame is that ?  do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens ?  why weren't the remaining ,  already filmed episodes aired in the us ?  they were broadcast elsewhere .   hey ,  fox !  are you listening ?  this was a great show ,  but you left us hanging .  if you're going to introduce new drama/mysteries ,  at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid-theme .  every time something like this happens  ( and it seems to happen a lot with you - i . e .  ,  fox )  ,  there are more of those who will  " wait and see "  before investing their time .  this means you will see an artificially low interest share ,  and are more likely to end the series .  see ?  it is a vicious cycle .  don't let us down again .  .  . 
i'm usually not too into a specific show  ( save for the o . c .  & desperate housewives .  .  . hey ,  i am 20 !  )  ,  but ,  no kidding ,  after one episode of reunion i was hooked .   i can't even say how bummed i was that it's time-slot conflicted with bush's speech last night because i was really looking forward to the 1987 episode ,  which will now air next thursday .  again ,  that conflict was disadvantageous because ,  being a new show ,  it needs to build up a following and having the second episode pushed back a week kills some momentum .   that said ,  tv doesn't always have to be emmy worthy to be enjoyable .  i don't expect reunion to take home any prizes ,  but i do expect it will be able to capture my attention all season .  ever watch the first few episodes of a beloved show years later ?  sometimes you wonder how you ever got hooked .  character building takes some time .   the one episode for each year idea is wonderful ,  in my opinion .  the only other show i can recall doing something similar is 24 ,  with each episode being an hour .  .  . and having an eventful year is more realistic than a day that eventful !  please give this show a shot .  relax about art form .  .  . it's just tv ! 
believe it or not ,  at 12 minutes ,  this film  ( for 1912 )  is a full-length film .  very ,  very few films were longer than that back then ,  but that is definitely not what sets this odd little film apart from the rest !  no ,  what's different is that all the actors  ( with the exception of one frog )  are bugs .  .  . yes ,  bugs !  this simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of chaplin ,  laurel and hardy or max linder but instead this russian production uses bugs  ( or ,  i think ,  models that looked just like bugs )  .  chaplin and laurel and hardy were yet to be discovered and i assume linder was busy ,  so perhaps that's why they used bugs !  using stop-motion ,  the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well--and a heck of a lot more realistically than king kong 21 years later !    the film starts with mr .  beetle sneaking off for a good time .  he goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home .  but ,  unfortunately for mr .  beetle ,  he is caught on camera by a local film buff .  plus ,  he doesn't know it but mrs .  beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter .  of course ,  there's a lot more to this domestic comedy than this ,  but the plot is age-old and very entertaining for adults and kids alike .   weird but also very amazing and watchable . 
this is one of the best animated movies i've ever seen in my life .  this isn't just a fun movie ,  or a well-made movie .  this is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it weren't ,  just the technical skill that went into making it ,  would grant it a place in the history of animation .   wladyslaw starewicz created a stop-motion movie about the secret life of beetles .  he imagined a coherent world of insects ,  with jobs ,  houses ,  nightclubs ,  movie houses ,  even little props like posters and bicycles and paintings .   in this movie he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge .  mr .  beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly ,  much to the chagrin of a grasshopper ;  but he's a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling .  mr .  beetle returns home and finds mrs .  beetle having her own affair .  mr .  beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife .  the two make up and go out to the movies .  and the movie they watch is mr .  beetle and the dragonfly .  described thus it sounds banal ,  but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema .  along with emile cohl and jiri trnka ,  wladyslaw starewicz pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work .  for that reason he must not remain forgotten . 
this short is a puzzlement .  words fail me here ,  as this is almost indescribable ,  technically exceptional after more than 90 years  ( the visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing )  ,  this is not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or  " normal'-because it most certainly is not either .  this be an odd one ,  gang .  well worth checking out ,  but if things like ren and stimpy make your head hurt ,  you may want to skip this .  recommended . 
an absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousies and infidelities surrounding a beetle marriage ,  russian animation pioneer wladyslaw starewicz's  " mest kinematograficheskogo operatora "   (  " the cameraman's revenge "  ,  or  " the revenge of a kinematograph cameraman "  )  is a delight of early animation ,  brimming with highly-effective stop-motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination .   mr .  and mrs .  beetle have a completely uneventful marriage ,  and both yearn for more excitement in their lives .  mr .  beetle's desires can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the  " gay dragonfly "  night club ,  whom he visits whenever he takes a  " business trip "  to the city .  she is the only one who understands him .  a fellow admirer of this dancer ,  an aggressive grasshopper ,  is jealous that mr .  beetle has stolen his lady and ,  as fate would have it ,  he is also a movie cameraman .  the devious grasshopper follows mr .  beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room ,  where he films their exploits through the keyhole .   meanwhile ,  mrs .  beetle has ,  likewise ,  acquired a friend to add excitement to her life .  he is an artist ,  and he brings her a painting for a present ,  before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy .  at that moment ,  however ,  mr .  beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle .  as mr .  beetle bashes through the front door ,  the artist friend clambers up the chimney ,  but he doesn't escape without mr .  beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him .   there is a certain irony in the statement that follows :   " mr .  beetle is generous .  he forgives his wife and takes her to a movie .  "  he is generous enough to forgive her ,  and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier .  at this point in time ,  however ,  we still haven't forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge ,  and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film mr .  and mrs .  beetle are attending .  suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of mr .  beetle's disloyalty ,  and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella ,  before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper .   in the final scene ,  both mr .  and mrs .  beetle ,  now somewhat more appreciative of each other ,  are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when mr .  beetle sought his final revenge .  we do ,  indeed ,  hope that  " the home life of the beetles will be less exciting in the future "  this film may appear to be a mere story of the comings-and-goings of a miniscule insect species ,  but starewicz is communicating so much more than that .  this isn't a story about beetles  it is a story about us .  and it's startlingly accurate ,  isn't it ?  ! 
the cameraman's revenge is an unusual short not because of the subject matter  ( adultery )  or because it's animated  ( winsor mccay had introduced little nemo on film by this time )  but because it depicts bugs to tell the story !  ladislaw starewicz had originally wanted to film actual bugs fighting but couldn't get them to do it on camera because of the hot lights they suffered through so he took dead ones and started using stop-motion techniques to manipulate movements to his satisfaction .  this short does a good job of putting human characteristics on little creatures such as riding motorcycles ,  painting ,  filming ,  kissing ,  and dancing .  starewicz would also make frogland  ( 1922 )  and the mascot  ( 1933 )  but his first notable work would be this one .  if you're interested in this and the other shorts mentioned ,  check your local library to borrow the dvd the cameraman't revenge and other fantastic tales from image entertainment . 
ladislas starewicz's curiosity with insects and cinema melds into a short film about a love triangle between mr .  beetle ,  an artistic grasshopper ,  and mrs .  beetle .  the rather simple story of an adulterous beetle couple that both seek stimulation outside their marriage is similar to a biograph or vitagraph short of the time .  starewicz's twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires straightening the legs in frame-by-frame animation .  the story builds as mr .  beetle is unknowingly caught on camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper .  when mr .  beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend ,  he chases her around angrily ,  but eventually forgives her and takes her out to see a movie .  however ,  mrs .  beetle soon learns of her husband's infidelities as the movie they watch is the jealous grasshopper's footage of mr .  beetle and the dragonfly together .  mrs .  beetle thrashes mr .  beetle with her umbrella ,  mr .  beetle jumps through the screen ,  and they both end up in jail after the projector they wreck catches on fire .  the insects are placed in humanized settings such as a house or a nightclub ,  and are given human characteristics of jealousy ,  anger ,  lust ,  and revenge .  the insect characters carry briefcases ,  drive motorcars ,  and even wear shoes yet they also twitch their antennae and open and close their mandibles as real insects would .  the novelty of the story doesn't wear itself out ,  even after multiple viewings ,  but as fluid as the movements are ,  the film moves slowly .  action happens with intricate detail ,  but rapidity and a quicker pace of filming is lost in the process .  despite its pace ,  the film is an excellent example of starewicz's early puppetry and is highly recommended . 
for animation buffs it's a must ,  but even general audiences will enjoy the cameraman's revenge ,  a very early example of 'pixilation' by the hard-working pioneer wladyslaw starewicz .  starewicz and his helpers painstakingly manipulated a cast of flexible insect figures to tell this story ,  paving the way for the likes of willis o'brien ,  george pal ,  ray harryhausen ,  and legions of modern digital effect creators .   the cameraman's revenge is only about 10 minutes long ,  but packs in lots of amusing detail as the story follows the amorous adventures of two beetles from their home to a nightclub ,  a hotel ,  a cinema ,  and ,  eventually ,  a prison cell .  there are two brief dance numbers at the nightclub  ( performed by a frog and a dragonfly )  ,  a scuffle between a beetle and a grasshopper ,  and a large-scale donnybrook at the cinema ,  which ends with the projector bursting into flames .  pretty elaborate goings-on for 1912 ,  when even john bray and winsor maccay were just getting started ,  and walt disney was still in grade school !   it's interesting to note ,  too ,  what an impact the alteration of a silent movie's title cards can have on the story being told .  i've seen two versions of this film offered by two video companies ,  and watched them back-to-back ,  and although the image content itself is almost identical ,  two different sets of intertitles tell two very different stories .   ( and the plot outline someone provided above tells yet a third story ,  which suggests that there's another version out there somewhere .  )  the british film institute's print ,  which has rhyming intertitles ,  tells the story of two sibling beetles ,  each secretly married ,  who hide this information from one another in order to inherit their late father's fortune .  the other ,  russian print ,  tells a simpler story of married beetles who are each guilty of infidelity .  in the russian version mr .  beetle visits his girlfriend at the  " gay dragonfly "  nightclub ,  while in the english version brother bill beetle visits his wife at the music-hall .  personally ,  i prefer the straightforward-- and spicier --russian story ;  the bfi version tries to cram too much plot into what should be a simple tale ,  and some of the rhymes are a bit awkward .   still ,  in any rendition ,  the cameraman's revenge is a delightful film ,  and would make an ideal lead-in to that other great animated work which features beetles ,  yellow submarine . 
this film has special effects which for it's time are very impressive .  some if it is easily explainable with the scenes played backwards but the overlay of moving images on an object on film is surprisingly well done given that this film was made more than 94 years ago . 
tess of the storm country was a mary pickford vehicle i had intended to get for some time .  i finally found a vhs copy for a reasonable price and got to enjoy it .   mary gives her typical spunky ,  innocently sexy portrayal of a wrong-side-of-tracks girl who wins the heart of a rich heir .  only this time the stakes are higher :  a false murder charge ,  an illegitimate child  ( and ensuing case of mistaken motherhood )  and contemplated suicide .   one can see why pickford wanted to redo this one .  the story is a real morality tale ,  the kind that she loved to star in .  the controversial topics aren't always spelled out plainly ;  a viewer has to pay attention and pick up on hints to catch everything that is being implied on first viewing  although everything is more or less explained in the end .   about the only negative remark i can make would be concerning jean hersholt and the dog .  hersholt ,  whose character ,  ben letts ,  looks to be about 6-2 ,  200 pounds  ( bigger next to mary ,  of course !  )  ,  is sent fleeing in panic when a 60-pound chocolate lab charges toward him !  then ,  to top it off  ( or maybe to justify his perplexing fear of the dog )  ,  it manages to pin him to the ground and somehow injures him so badly that he is still struggling to get up much later ,  as a bad storm hits !  this is the same lovable lab that sleeps with frederick  ( lloyd hughes )  and cuddles with mary !  yet mary later throws boiling water in ben's face ,  which barely slows him !  ok ,  i've vented about ben and the chocolate lab !  other than that ,  the movie was quite touching and certainly held my attention .  pickford's supporting cast was strong and believable .  this is certainly among her better films . 
mary pickford often stated that tess skinner was her favorite movie role .  well said !  she played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced ,  she not only had to purchase the rights from adolph zukor but even give him credit on the film's main title card .  needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning .  indeed ,  in my opinion ,  the movie itself rates as one the all-time great experiences of silent cinema .   true ,  director john s .  robertson doesn't move his camera an inch from start to finish ,  but in robertson's skillful hands this affectation not only doesn't matter but is probably more effective .  a creative artist of the first rank ,  robertson is a master of pace ,  camera angles and montage .  he has also drawn brilliantly natural performances from all his players .  jean hersholt who enacts the heavy is so hideously repulsive ,  it's hard to believe this is the same man as kindly dr christian ;  while lloyd hughes renders one of the best acting jobs of his entire career .  true ,  it's probably not the way mrs white intended ,  but it serves the plot admirably ,  as otherwise we would have difficulty explaining why the dope spent a fortune on defense but made not the slightest attempt to ascertain who actually fired the gun that killed his future brother-in-law !  needless to say ,  this particular quality of the likable hero is downplayed by jack ging in the bowdlerized 1960 version which also totally deletes the author's trenchant attack on smug ,  middle-class christianity .  notice how the well-washed priest here moves forward a pace or two in surprise at the interruption ,  but then makes no attempt whatever to assist our plucky little heroine in the performance of duties that he himself was supposedly ordained to administer .  this is a very moving scene indeed because it is so realistically presented .    " tess "  also provides an insight into the work of another fine actress ,  gloria hope ,  whose work was entirely confined to silent cinema .  she married lloyd hughes in 1921 and retired in 1926 to devote her life completely to her husband and their two children .  lloyd hughes died in 1958 ,  but she lived until 1976 ,  easily contactable in pasadena ,  but i bet no-one had the brains to interview her .  another opportunity lost !    to me ,  forrest robinson only made a middling impression as skinner .  i thought he was slightly miscast and a brief glance at his filmography proves this :  he usually played priests or judges !  but david torrence as usual was superb .   in all ,  an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values . 
this film does not fail to engage and move ,  even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with modern over-produced sound and computer enhanced techniques .   the experience of the movie goer in 1922 who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been truly profound and a thoroughly satisfying experience .   one has to ask could a film maker today make a two hour silent movie and make it interesting and achieve the same structure tempo and balance as this movie has .  silent film making was pure art ,  it had to hold the attention through its structure ,  direction and acting - there was no padding out with more words or computer generated distractions .  a poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable .   this film needs to be put into context for those who might be disconcerted with the mention of christian themes .  this is not a 'christiany' film ,  it is not selling anything .  these themes along with reference to current moral standards often appear in this era - also church going on sundays was a national past time ,  christianity was a given in most households thus the film is only depicting normal life as it was then .  the themes would have rung true and deep at the time .   it is most odd given the strong support to good christian thinking of this particular movie  ( and it is not preaching religion to anyone ,  only highlighting the difference between hypocrites and the honest ) that in 1922 a pastor in an open debate with a representative from the film industry with a large crowd denounced pickford as an example of immorality ,  along with some other individuals he named .  ny times 1922 .   maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and ,  learned some lessons .   the pastor complained that since the film industry had started church attendance had dropped 500 , 000 .  the film representative in the debate however made the following observations ;  that saloon attendance had also dropped ,  that there were far more pastors in prison than actors  ( fact )  and that selecting a few examples from among the many was not representative of the whole .   thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film .   this is a wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices .  mary pickford ,  naive ,  honest ,  feisty ,  full of happiness and joy ,  faithful ,  humorous and silently sacrificing - though poor and uneducated she represented the perfect character .  this however is not thrust down our throat but revealed bit by bit through the film .   this is reminiscent of some modern chinese films where characters are slowly ,  languidly revealed over the course of a film and it is this tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character .    it has a smooth even tempo for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section .  the last 30 minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound ,  running dialog - it was achieved through deft acting and great directing .  it is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you haven't hear a word spoken ,  but it feels like you have heard everything .   the supporting cast put in great performances especially gloria hope ,  jean hersholt and lloyd hughes .    the final few minutes are typical pickford understated humor as she goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow ,  a near perfect balance and ending .  this is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated .  chaplin used this device often and copied some of from pickford .   another special observation to be made about silent films and especially pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored ,  with the actors over-exposure .  that pickford is usually thoroughly the center of attention through most of her movies but the people still couldn't get enough of her is a testament to her fine acting ability . 
tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford's films .  at two hours ,  it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed .  mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a  " greatest hits "  performance with bits of mary the innocent ,  mary the little devil ,  mary the little mother ,  mary the spitfire ,  mary the romantic heroine ,  etc .  characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past .  the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question !  if the academy awards had been around in 1922 ,  no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary's . 
had this been the original 1914 version of tess of the storm country  ( also starring mary pickford )  ,  i probably would have rated it a lot higher ,  as this sort of extreme melodrama and sentimentality was pretty typical of the teens .  however ,  by 1922 ,  this film was already starting to show its age .  and ,  compared to many of ms .  pickford's other films  ( such as daddy longlegs ,  sparrows ,  my best girl and suds )  ,  tess comes up a tad short--and not every pickford film merits a 10  ( even if she was  " america's sweetheart "  )  .  now this isn't to say that it's a bad film--it certainly isn't .  but ,  i just can't see how so many have given this film a 10 .   the film has a very long and complicated plot--especially because most films of the era were shorter .  a rich old crank builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river .  at the bottom of the hill are some dirty squatters who he hates but who he cannot evict .  so he tries to come up with a variety of ways to get them off the land .  one ends up in tragedy ,  when his daughter's fiancé is killed in a scuffle with the po' folks .  the man accused of the murder is dear old mary's father ,  though he is innocent .  to make things a lot worse ,  the only witness to the real murder won't talk and the dead man had gotten his fiancée pregnant !  so ,  at this point ,  we have an innocent man in prison waiting to be executed and a pregnant lady afraid to tell her sanctimonious father she is  " in the family way "  .  there's a ton more to the film ,  such as the crank's son falling in love with mary ,  but it's best you just see the film for yourself .   the film excels in some ways .  the plot ,  while very complicated ,  is also rather interesting and the cinematography is top-notch .  the very final scene is also pretty cute .  however ,  there is so much overt sentimentality you can practically cut it with a knife .  mary is so good and so sweet and so plucky ,  at times the viewer might find it all a bit hard to take .  while it worked great in 1922  ( making her the biggest star in the world )  ,  today it's very dated .  this is not true of all her films ,  but this one certainly is .   by the way ,  the image entertainment dvd is of decent quality ,  though a few scenes are badly degraded--something that isn't very surprising considering the age of the film .  also ,  the only extras included are a brief filmography . 
me being of irish origins ,  loved this movie ,  not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest .  i loved the girl who he fell in love with too ,  she was pretty .  they were such a cute couple .  the ending was so sad .  love this movie !  although it is a little dirty ,  it reminds of a british or irish version of prime .  if you liked this movie you should watch prime .  same story line young guy falls for older women ,  older women falls for young guy to .  a lot of paths cross ,  in the end ,  the best decision is made or task is completed .  don't have anything else to say ,  without ruining the whole movie ,  all though i thought the french guy was ugly ,  less appealing to me .  umm .  .  . if you like irish movies ,  i would recommend  " circle of friends "   , that movie is so good .  quick quote ,  you might not get unless you watch it "  well ,  thats my dinner ruined .  "  lol
i had never seen a silent movie until july 24 ,  2005 .  i had never seen a movie with mary pickford in it .  i've seen thousands of movies .  very few are hypnotic to me .  i found last of the mohicans and unforgettable  ( ray liotta )  to be hypnotic ,  so consider the source as you read this .  i started watching tess of the storm country on tcm just to see who this mary pickford was ,  who has been credited by many for launching hollywood .  i had no idea what i was in for .  two hours later ,  i snapped out of it ,  and realized i'd watched one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen ,  playing a role perfectly suited to her .  imagine a movie fan in 1922 ,  having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before .  you would have to see her again and again .  the setting was perfect for a girl that expressive .  she was a poor squatter ,  couldn't speak the king's english ,  but you had to admire her .  what a movie .  .  .  time to start my mary pickford movie collection ! 
uneducated & defiant ,  beautiful tess of the storm country is the daughter of a fisherman squatting on a rich man's land .  spirited & bold ,  she captures the heart of the millionaire's son ,  but violence ,  terror & sudden death are what will haunt her immediate future before she can claim the sweet peace of happiness .   mary pickford is utterly charming in this splendid ,  heart-wrenching film .  she considered tess to be her favorite role and she fills it with all the spunky joy & enthusiasm which made her for years the world's most popular movie star .  the story has all the essential elements for a modern fairy tale ,  with mary the lovely ,  distressed heroine beset by all manner of dangerous ,  stressful situations .  the atmospherics are first-rate ,  with the outdoor fishing village sets being particularly well-conceived .   in the supporting cast ,  jean hersholt stands out as the vile villain who tries forcing pickford to marry him .  hersholt ,  a very gentle soul off screen ,  manages brilliantly to depict his character's complete moral corruption .   this was actually the second time pickford filmed tess .  a 1914 version had been one of her first important films ,  but its production values were a bit antiquated by the standards of the 1920's  ( no close-ups ,  for instance )  and mary ,  producing her own films & powerful enough by 1922 to make whatever film she wanted ,  decided for the only time in her career to remake a film .  the end result certainly lived up to her expectations .  both films were very popular at the box office .   a fascinating study for some future film researcher would be the influence of christianity in mary pickford's life ;  it certainly runs like a golden thread through the silent movies she produced .  although the romanticism inherent in the very nature of silent cinema might cause these spiritual sentiments to appear somewhat awkward today ,  we are compelled to accept them as sincere reflections ,  by their very repetition ,  of mary's heartfelt beliefs .  in tess ,  one beautiful scene in particular stands out in this regard :  pickford is teaching herself to read using a bible .  she indicates to lloyd hughes  ( who plays her sweetheart )  a word from near the back of the book that she does not understand .  he mimes it for her  ( the word is obviously `crucified' )  and ,  eyes turned heavenward as the full meaning of the sacrifice dawns upon her ,  mary's face becomes positively beatific .   a splendid new orchestral score for tess has been supplied by jeffrey mark silverman which perfectly underscores the beauty & pathos of this wonderful film . 
here is proof of why mary pickford was `america's sweetheart . ' in this rather complex drama ,  mary plays the young daughter of a squatter that dare to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the `hill-toppers . ' the scenes where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delightful .  she is even willing to take a bath .  that mary could pull this role off at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her diminutive stature  ( 5' )  .   tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges .  she does so with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time .  tess packs a wallop and is not shy about fighting with anyone .  why she agrees to help the `hill-topper' daughter is beyond me ,  but she sacrifices her own happiness in order to keep a deep secret .  pickford's close ups are wonderful .   danish-born jean hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain .  the scene in which he manhandles a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables  ( or whatever )  at the movie screen .  if forrest robinson  ( who plays daddy skinner )  had worn a beard ,  he would have been a match for the model used in those world war i recruiting posters of uncle sam  wants you !   although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning ,  it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or pure `americana . ' the film highlights choices available to us all involving making someone else happy and what it is to be a real christian .  recommended . 
this movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous lifestyles of the stars .  it tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to .  plus the bomb blast scene is very real .   what you read and are taught just does not happen !  !  !   can raise your bp level by 10%  all actors played their role very well .   some scenes may / could have been avoided to include teenagers .   this movie is quite adult in nature .   not a movie that can be seen with family .   casting is great !  !  ! 
this is yet another tell-it-as-it-is madhur bhandarkar film .  i am not sure why he has this obsession to show child moles***ion and g*y concepts to the indian filmy audience ,  but i find some of those scenes really disgusting !  what's new ?  it is a nice piece put together by bhandarkar ,  where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous film ,  mr & mrs iyer .  what makes this movie different is ,  that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or is friends with ,  such as her roomies ,  her colleagues ,  film stars ,  models ,  rich people and others featured in the entertainment page#3 in her newspaper .   noticeable :  it is another good performance from mrs iyer .  she is likely to be noticed for this role .  she does selective roles but shines in them .  she is noticeably de-glamorized and less beautiful in this film .  but then ,  entertainment reporters are not supposed to outshine the people they cover ,  right ?  verdict :  madhur has come up with another good movie ,  that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely .  however ,  this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey .   is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people ?  or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting that with the life of the real crime reporter ?  is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press ?  or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and g*y folk .  the other concepts brought forth include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co-stars ,  if they wish to enter bollywood .   in addition ,  he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people ,  etc .  he also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich families .   this was all okay for me .  .  but might be too complex for an average movie-goer ,  who just wants to relieve some stress from day to day work
page 3 is a great movie .  the story is so refreshing and interesting .  not once throughout the movie did i find myself staring off into space .  konkana sen did a good job in the movie ,  although i think someone with more glamour or enthusiasm would have been better ,  but she did do a great job .  all the supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie along .  boman irani did a great job .  there is one thing that stands out in this movie the story it is great ,  and very realistic ,  it doesn't beat around the bush it is very straight forward in sending out its message .  i think more movie like this should be made ,  i am sick of watching the same candy floss movies over and over ,  they are getting hard to digest now .  everyone should watch page 3 ,  it is a great film .  -just my 2 cents  :  ) 
page 3 **** out of 4 stars  madhvi  ( konkona sen )  enters her boyfriend's house and its empty .  she looks here and there and then goes in his bedroom and you get the picture - 'ah !  another girl  that two-timing baddie and yes indeed he his two timing her but it's a guy this time around .  and i say 'brilliant ! '  end of spoilers  ( the above scene is not a spoiler really  .  .  .  but for me it was so i didn't want to take a chance )   when asked upon as how was this film ,  my friend answered 'oh ,  it just an exposé of the p3 people' which made me believe that ill be watching a stupid movie if nothing more .  when i went to the theater ,  i thought to myself '' i better get a pen and a paper to jot down the bad things about this film'' but i was proved entirely wrong and then some because i could muster only the goods .  this film was great .  great ,  not because it is offbeat and noncommercial cinema like storyline but because of the cleverness in the screenplay and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly which could have been a dumb and senseless movie if given in the wrong hands .   konkona sen sharma is grace .  she is so damn beautiful who has nailed her role perfectly as if she was born to play this part .  one of the most charming actresses i've ever seen .  but this is not the only performance which is good in the film ,  there's sandhya mridul ,  boman irani and atul kulkarni .  particularly sandhya mridul who just fires up the screen .   ( and guess what even the unusually accented tara sharma speaks normally )   the movies stars off with some silly old parties of the hush-hush celebrities of the film industry et al and you get the idea of what this movie will be about .  and for about half hour through the film you feel just about the same .  but then the movie picks up the pace grabs onto a good storyline and never lets go of it .  even boman irani agrees to that statement  'it was a good story ,  madhvi' .   ( thank you )  .  the great thing is that it tackles the issue of how silly these people are with style and does not make it over done and also tackles the social issues and does not make them boring .  in the end its all a roller-coaster ride and madhvi informs us that by just smiling at all these people .  just the reason why i love watching films .  ecstatic film-making .  the screenplay is beautiful ,  clever and witty . 
madhur from chandni bar started making realistic films ,  which some people called dry   he made satta which was another realistic though filmy film but a great film  aan men at work was a formula film by him which flopped  he returns with his superlative page 3  a film which dwelves into the lives of journalists and it's a brilliant film  the film is well narrated though the half baked romantic portions of konkana could be avoided but that is forgiven  the entire upendra limaye track is superb too  while the atul kulkarni track is great too  the dial between manoj joshi and his friends are funny at first but repetitive at times  the subplot of bikram- tara is brilliant and so is the entire hospital scene and also the final child abuse which shocks you  the film has a open ended ending which is nicely handled  madhur does a great job music is okay  konkana excels as madhavi ,  using her expressions to the best tara sharma is decent except her voice sandhya mridul is good as usual upendra limaye excels in his part as the cop ,  one of the talented actors sadly he isn't used well nowdays atul kulkarni too is good in his small part boman irani is restrained and does a great job rest are okay
andie macdowell's facial expressions are great again in this movie .  when you enter 40 and have been single for a while  ( or all your life )  you may feel you are wasting away .  the movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your antennae is acutely active .  i liked the quick sexual encounter ,  which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher  ( macdowell )  .  her ex-student is cute enough ,  still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long .    there are some parts that i thought rather unrealistic or unpractical ,  though .  for example ,  at a scene where the other women's jealousy override and a scene was set up to make andie macdowell dump the young man ,  would a mature police officer  ( the other friend of macdowell )  allow her friend to do such a sinister act ?  is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car ?  of course accidents happen all the time ,  but i hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with  ( that was the hardest part to believe !  !  for such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long ?  ?  )  .  .  .    maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not last for long .  beside they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public ,  especially to jealousy women over 40 ,  who are waiting some miracles to happen .  the sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet ,  but if the man continued to live ,  would that last ?  for how long ?  nobody knows .  nonetheless ,  it's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later .  .  .  .  a year later maybe . 
yet again ,  madhur bhandarkar takes you on a ride to the wild side .  and a remarkable one it is ,  literally and figuratively .   mumbai hi-society -- stars and starlets ,  glam dolls and witch doctors ,  business tycoons and broker types ,  yep the whole stinking lot -- are in sharp focus here .  in typical tabloid fashion ,  their worlds unfold ,  with every colorful story a clever sub-plot in itself .   a struggling starlet dumped by the producer after getting her pregnant ,  the stewardess and her high-profile husband ,  the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife ,  the reporters and the police captain ;  all shades on display and countless hues in between .   bhandarkar does a swell job of digging up the dirt on the drama kings ,  the dancing queens and the living dead .  atul kulkarni packs a punch ,  as does boman irani and sandhya mrudul .  konkona sen sharma is effective as the ex-crime beat reporter ,  but she could have been dolled up a little in keeping with the job change and the party circuit .   highly focused  ( running time 140 min )  and refreshingly different film ,  well worth the money . 
madhur bhandarkar has given it all raw .  but the best part is he hasn't forgotten to give the ingredients .  it has come short and crisp to the viewer and it is the audience to make the choice now .  page 3 is a revelation of the naked truth irrespective of the crudeness attached to it .   madhavi  ( konkan sharma )  is a journalist and enjoys her work .  a simple and peaceful life adores her with a caring boyfriend and a nice roommate pearl .  she covers the page 3  ( celebrity page )  of nation today ,  where she has a very supportive editor deepak suri  ( boman irani .  )  but life takes turn for her as she hits the first bump and takes herself away from page 3 and goes into crime bit .  omigosh !  a whole new world was waiting for her there .  she is shocked ,  excited ,  stunned with the revelation .  her reaction has resulted in losing the job .  at the end she is back to page 3 .  now when she meets any celebrity in a party ,  she knows the actual looks of each ,  hidden under the illusive face .   the movie has a message and it is crude .  the audience needs to get it in their own color .  the theme and the screenplay was fantastic .  there are some very good thoughts applied to prepare the audiences .  like the foreplay-club is shown before the pedophiliac exhibition ,  the short suspense before gay-actions in bathroom .  the dialogs are strong and the actors are really good at delivering it .  charu mohanty's 2 words speaks volumes and he is very successful in uttering those two words with such ingenuity ,  it leaves an impact .  the set selections could have been better .  the songs don't stand anywhere ;  but they were needed in the background .  atul kulkarni has a small role with high-impact .  there were a few flaws visible .  atul kulkarni explaining konkan sharma that honesty should be tagged along with intelligence .  there could have been a better dialog as this sounds like a preach .  the meeting between thapar and his daughter doesn't call for acting .  that scene looks very unprofessional .   overall it is a must-watch movie with selective options before the pedophilia incident .  that may spoil your mood . 
the movie is a real show of how unemotional and selfish the upper society has become .  it has plenty of characters and each and every character is representing a different category of person .  no character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical indian movies and no character is 100% bad rather all are just different .  the movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions ,  drama and entertainment .  for the very first time i liked a movie that has raised some social questions .  i would recommend all to see the movie .  madhavi sharma is a journalist who covers those hip-shaking parties of bollywood for the page 3 of the newspaper but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper .  but this is not all ,  then it shows how she couldn't survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children ,  how brutally her voice is suppressed .  even she is fired from the job .  then she couldn't find a job of crime reporter and has to do page 3 again .  not only her but a very very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie and all gives different feeling while watching the movie .  i would really congratulate the director for making such a great movie .  please do not afford to miss it . 
madhur bhandarkar goes all out to touch upon taboo issues and gives the most realistic picture of the modern society .  one gets the impression of the director even from his earlier movies like satta and chandni bar .  the issues just hinted on in the latter movie are explored and exposed in totality here .  the casting is amazing and one can see the judgements on each scene from many angles .  mostly ,  the movie leaves you wondering on lots of facts around .  as you start guessing the things ,  you end up at most being close ,  but missing the mark in many a scenes .  it leaves a lasting impression in the end .   actors to watch are konkana sen sharma ,  boman irani & atul kulkarni among others .  the dialogues are well written and you feel you've lived around some of these people .  there are still some scenes that make you think of more depths .  the songs are in the background saving time and lata's voice in a very meaningful song  " kitne ajeeb "  leaves you feeling you're left all alone in the midst of the modern society ! 
the first review i saw of page 3 said  " what is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say ?  "  .  should he say something so decisive .   the most beautiful thing about page 3 is it doesn't take sides .  no propaganda whatsoever .  this is the film that captures so many angles of an issue ( i don't know what do i call as an  " issue "  here )  and yet like any mediocre movie doesn't come up with an solution .  i was so intrigued when i realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario just like it started .   the movie defines so many characters who are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more apathetic .  i wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead .  so watch page 3 if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times . 
page 3 is most definitely a very enthralling and captivating eye-opener that very cleverly exposes the hypocrite lifestyles of mumbai's elite .  from the fake kisses to the plastered smiles ,  page 3 leaves no stone unturned in revealing the shocking lives of the rich and the famous .  backstabbing ,  gossip ,  corruption ,  and scandal lurk in every dark corner in the world of glitz and glam .  humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where social darwinism is the prevailing mentality .  everyone is constantly craving for more money ,  more fame ,  and a higher reputation ,  driving them to do the most shameful things imaginable ranging from signing film contracts at a funeral to child molestation .  anything is possible in this metropolis where there is a such a wide gap between the social classes .  the audience sees the ugliness of both of these classes through the eyes of the protagonist .  she observes the suffocating atmosphere and the mind-boggling frenzy that the socialites live in .  bollywood ,  business tycoons ,  politicians ,  and the underworld are all intertwined in a completely convoluted mess !  kitne ajeeb hai is a nice track as is the peppy kuan main doob jaongi .  terrific film with excellent character development ! 
madhur bhandarkar directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of journalism today .   celebrities party endlessly ,  they like to be seen at these parties ,  and to get due exposure in the media .  in fact the film would have us believe that this exposure makes celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this .  imo there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a  " i need you ,  you need me "  kind of relationship .  however ,  the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa .  anyhow ,  in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column  ( page 3 of the newspaper )  reporter konkana sen sharma .  she is shown as this celebrity maker ,  very popular at the social gatherings .  she has a good friend in the gay abhijeet and in the struggling model rohit  ( bikram saluja )  .  she rooms with an air-hostess  the sassy pearl  ( sandhya mridul )  ,  and a struggling actress - gayatri  ( tara sharma )  .  the editor of the newspaper is boman irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by atul kulkarni .  the movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level .  the rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part ,  the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios ,  exploitation of power ,  hunger for media exposure .  into all this is layered in homosexuality ,  a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot ,  rampant drug use ,  pedophilia ,  police  " encounter "  deaths .  in light of all this pearl's desire to have a super rich husband ,  a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car ,  the bitching women ,  all seem benign ills .   the film has absolutely excellent acting by konkana sen sharma ,  atul kulkarni has almost no role  a pity in my opinion .  but the supporting cast is more than competent  ( boman irani is very good )  .  this is what saves the film for me .  mr .  bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash .  i wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively .  he berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful .  we have an item number in the framework of a bollywood theme party ,  the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a western beat .  i hope the next one from madhur bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the hindi film stereotyped ingredients .  the film is a brave  ( albeit flawed )  effort ,  certainly worth a watch . 
page 3 is one of those films madhur bhandarkar makes to expose societal filth .  the film is compelling ,  but ,  like most of bhandarkar's films ,  it is one-sided and overly pessimistic .  this film is all about tabloid journalism ,  gossip ,  celebrities .  the film exposes the lives of socialites ,  whose lifestyle is disastrously boastful ,  peculiar and repulsive .  they party ,  they care for nothing but fame ,  they plan parties at funerals ,  they are craving for more money and a higher reputation ,  they will do anything to get due exposure in the media ,  to get their names boldly printed on the daily newspaper's social column known as  " page 3 "  with huge photographs which will be the center of people's discussions .  they are attention seeking ,  salacious and hypocrite .  the film industry is shown as sleazy ,  with casting couch being a common phenomenon among filmmakers .  that's where our lovely heroine ,  a young social column reporter madhvi sharma ,  is thrown .  all these people from mumbai's elite depend on her articles and she is the right person to befriend at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article .  later in the film we learn that even those who are madhvi's friends are no different from these high-society people .  this was tough viewing for me ,  although the film is unquestionably brave and the issues it deals with are interesting .   the film's music is average .  the only passable songs are  " kitne ajeeb "  and  " huzoor-e-ala "  ,  sung by the two melody queens lata mangeshkar and asha bhosle ,  respectively .  otherwise the soundtrack is bad .  one song which was particularly horrendous is  " filmy very filmy "  .  the film's writing is quite good .  the second half is far better than the first ,  as it turns more matter-of-fact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse .  that's where the film has to be applauded .  it was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and konkona sen sharma's character's disappointment was very easy to relate to .  she was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive .  atul kulkarni's part was very small but he did full justice to it .  boman irani is solid as the newspaper's editor .  sandhya mridul is lovable as madhvi's sassy roommate pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it .  the film's ending is really well-done ,  and provides a certain sigh of relief after the unimaginably tough proceedings .  page 3 is a good film ,  it is interesting and at times moving ,  but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated ,  overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous . 
i did not like chandni bar from the same director .   i did not watch his other movies .  they came and went .   but page-3 is nicely made .  seems real .  like satya from rgv did .   the mental sickness of the so called high society is the summary of the movie .  in the midst of all the sickness ,  its difficult to lead a normal life which the protagonist ,  konkana sen ,  does .  serious movie ,  not to be watched with children or expecting wives .  page-3 of newspapers is the usual place for reporting the activities going on in the parties of the rich and elite who indulge in much more filth then what is reported .  how this page-3 is also a business prospect is shown in the movie .  event management firms get paid to arrange parties and make a rich but not famous people famous overnight by clicking photographs with the celebrities invited to the party .   the western culture has crept into the high society of mumabi quite deeply .  the movie shows it boldly ,  no holds barred .   madhur bhandarkar starts a new journey from here . 
the write word  what you see is what you get .  not really !  what madhur bhandarkar's brave and brilliant 'page 3' does is destroy the myth attached to the glam and glitterati that colour the pages of our newspapers and whose lives ( read party habits )  we follow with such maniacal fervour which only our intrinsic voyeuristic streak can explain .    the page 3 phenomenon is as deplorable as it is enigmatic .  how exactly did it gain such control over the printed word and when did it start to encroach into the front page is subject for another debate .  bhandarkar cleverly avoids that .  he is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence .  and in doing that ,  he pieces together the various elements of this way of life .  like robert altman ( although i'm not comparing bhandarkar to altman's genius )  ,  bhandarkar uses myriad characters to further his motive .  whether it is a page 3 wannabe nri ,  the gate-crashers ,  the newly-rich ,  an upcoming model ,  a socialite politician or an erotic novella authoress ;  all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate character-sketch ,  even if their parts may be miniscule .  and therein lays the film's appeal .    konkona sen sharma plays madhavi sharma ,  a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for nation today .  initially content with her job ,  she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly that is covered by its fake and cosmetic profligacy .  but bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moral-policing movie and avoids concentrating on one character alone .  hence the movie is not only about madhavi ,  but also equally about deepak suri ( boman irani ) - madhavi's editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery ,  anjali thapar ( soni razdan ) - a socialite suffocating from the social pollution ,  abhijeet ( rehan engineer ) - a homosexual make-up artist and madhavi's roommates pearl ( sandhya mridul ) - the sassy airhostess and gayatri ( tara sharma ) -an aspiring actress .  it seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many characters ( and more )  in one story ,  but full credit to nina arora and manoj tyagi for penning a tight screenplay .  the dialogues by sanjeev datta and bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail .    any narrative ,  no matter how good ,  can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances .  thankfully ,  'page 3' brims with actors and not stars .  konkona goes through her author-backed role with effortless ease .  ditto boman .  sandhya mridul gets the best written part ,  but almost overdoes it .  atul kulkarni is wasted though with an underwritten character .  at times ,  the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as possible ( paedophilia ,  homosexuality ,  etc .  )  .  but the contexts in which they are used do not make them look rushed .    ultimately ,  bhandarkar's attempt is to satiate our voyeurism ,  but he takes it a step further .  he takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world .  these are the same people that indulged in new-year's revelry while a few hundred kilometers away their fellow countrymen had been ravaged by nature's ferocity !  clever writing ,  skillfully incorporated songs ,  able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of finesse and poor production values .  'page 3' is an optimum way to enter a new year of cinema .   - abhishek bandekar  rating- ****  * poor ** average *** good **** very good ***** excellent  29th january ,  2005
as the story in my family goes ,  my dad ,  milton raskin ,  played the piano for the dorsey band .  after sinatra joined the band ,  my dad practiced with him for hours on end .  then ,  at a point in time ,  my dad told sinatra that he was actually to good to be tied up with such a small group  ( band )  ,  and that he should venture off on his own .  by that time sinatra had enough credits 'under his belt' to do just that !  dorsey never forgave my dad ,  and the rest ,  as they say ,  is history .   i have some pictures and records to that effect ,  and so does berkley university in california .   i have seen just about every sinatra movie more times than i wish to say ,  and his movies never get old  .   .   .  thank you frank
as with most of eleanor powell's films ,  this one plays out along the flimsiest of plots .  for some reason -- oh it is explained !  -- she's selected to transport a magnetic mine to cuba .  good guys and bad guys compete for the mine and who is who gets confusing .  but ,  as always ,  powell's dancing is superb and worth the price of admission .  and in this one lahr plays his cowardly lion ,  evoking warm memories of that technicolor film of 1939 .  a fringe benefit is hearing a young frank ,  with that wonderful voice and skinny vulnerability that he abandoned for his wise-guy persona later on .  in addition ,  the great drummer ,  buddy rich ,  has a wonderful time displaying his virtuosity .  watch particularly for his unique duet with dorsey's trumpet man ,  ziggy elman .  i say  " unique "  perhaps in ignorance ,  but i know of no other drum/trumpet sequence like this one on film or records .  this film is fun .  even skelton's goofy persona is relatively restrained .  powell shows again that she is the greatest film dancer ever . 
i thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends .  i laughed and cried and laughed and cried at the same time .  it was just really touching .  although not a new concept this was a very well made film . 
the plot of this enjoyable mgm musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing ,  dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing eleanor powell ,  abetted by tommy dorsey and his orchestra ,  featuring ziggy elman ,  buddy rich and frank sinatra .  red skelton shares top billing with powell ,  and he and sidekick bert lahr are given most of the comedic minutes ,  although skelton is more effective when he ,  if it can be believed ,  performs as powell's love interest ,  with virginia o'brien actually providing most of the film's humor as the dancer's companion .  the technical brilliance of powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within which buddy rich contributes his drumming skills ,  and which must be viewed several times in order to permit one's breathing to catch up with her precision .  director edward buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal ,  and permits powell's cotangent impossibilities to rule the affair ,  as is appropriate . 
what fun !  bucketfuls of good humor ,  terrific cast chemistry  ( skelton/powell/lahr/o'brien )  ,  dynamite dorsey-driven soundtrack !  miss powell's dance numbers have exceptional individual character and pizzazz .  her most winning film appearance . 
 " ship ahoy "  was probably made in order to showcase mgm talent .  the film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on its way to san juan ,  puerto rico ,  at the time in which the country was involved in wwii .  this was typical fare for the studios ,  which gave the movie going public light weight entertainment as a distraction during those difficult times the country was living .   the beautiful eleanor powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be reckoned with .  red skelton is also seen in a straight part with not too much clowning ,  as he pursues the beautiful ms .  powell on the ship that is bringing them to puerto rico .  the irresistible bert lahr has good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man .  also virginia grey is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone .   there are good musical numbers featuring tommy dorsey and his orchestra ,  in which one sees ,  among others ,  the amazing buddy rich ,  who has a few solos with mr .  dorsey and ms .  powell .  a young frank sinatra appears also as the lead singer of the band ,  backed by the pied pipers .   this is a nostalgic trip that should be savored by fans of this genre ,  which mgm totally controlled . 
i saw this movie with my friend and we couldnt stop laughing !  i mean there was nothing scary about this movie !  it was funny all the lines freddy said were hilarious !  i think they shoudln't have even made a new nightmare and just gone to freddy vs .  jason .  although some parts were gross  ( like the head blowing up )  .  and any elm street film from 1- 5 sucked .  this was the best besides number 1 .  i wouldnt recomend this movie if you want a good horror .  but if you have nothing else to do rent this and you'll laugh alot . i want to see the texas chainsaw massacre i think it would be scary .  freddy's dead the final nightmare overall grade :  b-
warning !  !  !  tons of dead giveaways !  !  !  don't read if you haven't seen this series !  or you can ,  whatever .   they're are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another ;  liars ,  cheats ,  maybe even some words that can't be uttered .  but when elm street 6 :  freddy's dead shows everyone who thought the series got old ,  and wanted to stop seeing him ,  or people who wanted their hero  ( or villian )  just stops for his final breath ,  this film was it .   this film starts with a parody of wizard of oz ,  then you see a kid who is named only as john doe ,  who is the last child in springwood ,  ohio ,  leaves and gets out of freddy territory .  a woman who resides at a hospital/ place to get kids off their feet kind of place meets this boy ,  and at the same time ,  has a dream about a man ,  a water tower ,  and a promise of a secret floating in her mind ,  goes back to springwood to figure out this frightening vision ,  and soon finds out that she is freddy's child ,  and we soon find out that freddy can only leave springwood if his daughter can be a sort of host for him .  and beyond that ,  fright ensues .  this film seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know .   this film has tons of humor ,  and cameo appearences ,  like rosanne barr and tom arnold ,  alice cooper ,  johnny depp ,  and a very young breckin meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic vision of flowers and iron butterfly's  " in-a-gadda-da-vida "  ,  then gets stuck in a super mario parody of sorts .  this film will either make you hate this movie ,  or like krueger even more .  the best of the best . 
first of all ,  i have to start this comment by saying i'm a huge nightmare on elm street fan .  i think it's the greatest horror series ever .  for me ,  freddy is the boogeyman !  of course ,  freddy's dead ,  which tried to be the last chapter back then ,  is a weird movie .  it doesn't have the same atmosphere than the previous films .  freddy has a lot of screen time .  some think it makes him less scary ,  which i do agree .  and that's ,  in my opinion ,  exactly the point .  this movie exists so we can know freddy a little better ,  who he is ,  who he were ,  how he became the man haunting our dreams .  for some people ,  it's a bad thing ,  it's better if we never know because it's scarier not to know why evil is evil .  obviously those people won't like rob zombie's remake of halloween .  to truly enjoy this one ,  you have to see things differently .  it's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you .  this was the first one ,  and it was awesome .  as the years passed by ,  freddy killed more and more people ,  and nobody could ever get rid of him for good .  now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil ,  the psychological aspects of freddy's realm of terror .  beside the story of freddy's past ,  i also really liked the atmosphere of the movie .  no more kids in springwood ,  only crazy grown-ups .  the nightmare scenes are all great .  the soundtrack is awesome ,  especially the opening song called ''i'm awake now'' performed by goo goo dolls .  in my opinion ,  the final nightmare is a horror masterpiece and i can't believe it's so underrated .  maybe it is misunderstood ,  or i have different tastes !  anyway ,  all freddy fans should watch it .  it has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too ,  and a lot of cameos !  get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed . 
okay ,  i am a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says on here that this is the worst !  but it's not !  !  !  haven't's you seen freddy's revenge ?  ?  ?  wtf !  that was the worst of all !  !  !  now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the freddy story and it's cool that he had a daughter etc .  etc .   and then i found out it was in 3-d !  !  !  i was so excited ,  i remember when i saw it on the dvd box set i instantly skipped to the 3-d sequences .  quite a lot was in 3-d though like lisa zanes hand ,  dream demons ,  freddy's claw  ( more than once )  ,  lezlie dean holding a knife ,  lisa zane with a baseball bat ,  doc's hand ,  freddy's head exploding .   i truly loved this movie because it was in 3-d ,  but i wish the whole movie was in 3-d not just the last 15 minutes .   by the way it's 15 minutes not ten !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
if your a hard core freddy fan then you might not like it .  this seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series .  not much to see here .  the only reason it holds it self up is the back story on freddy .   the one thing that is always great in nightmare movies are the death scenes .  but the death scenes were very crappy in this .  the visual effects were great and the acting was ok but the back story was excellent .  basically freddy's story comes full circle in this .   i have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws :    1 .  a nightmare on elm street .   ( 8/10 )    2 .  freddy's dead :  the final nightmare .   ( 7/10 )    3 .  a nightmare on elm street 4 :  the dream master .   ( 7/10 )    4 .  a nightmare on elm street 3 :  the dream warriors .   ( 7/10 )    5 .  a nightmare on elm street 5 :  the dream child .   ( 6/10 )    6 .  a nightmare on elm street 2 :  freddy's revenge .   ( 3/10 )    i recommend it if you enjoy the series .  this is were freddy is fully explained but thats all there is .  next on my list wes cravens new nightmare .    ( 7/10 ) 
freddy krueger the dream stalker from elm street returns , the great character actor robert englund is back in this sequel of nightmare 5 ,  dream child . i hope i got the number correctly . there's been so many , and this one is one of the best , especially for the cameos by ; rosanne barr  ( then arnold ) tom arnold , johnny depp ,  ( who did the very first nightmare in 84 ) alice cooper ( singer ) you will see freddy as a tormented child , a teenager who loves pain , and as a family guy ( creepy ) the effects are very funny and creative , the cast also includes lisa zane ( billy's sister )  breckin meyer ( road trip ) yaphet kotto ( alien , live and let die ) and amanda donahue ( father knows best ) i was one of the people 3who saw this in 3d , well the ending . i love 3d movies . i missed the first 3d wave in 1953 ( i wasn't even born yet ) the second wave was in 1983 . i like all the freddy movies . this one stands out as one of the better ones not counting the first which was absolutely brilliant , freddy became the new monster of the 80s and 90s , along with jason voorhees , chucky , micheal myers , and leather face . can you imagine a film with all of them ? i recommend this to all freddy fans and horror fans alike . that freddy is such a cut up . 8 out of 10 . 
ok - i admit .  i think kenny doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks ,  the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable ,  but reasonable plot .   starting out ,  we're introduced to the three lead females of the movie .  one a headmistress - very concerned about her image and never married .  a police officer - with child and a bad ex to go on about .  the third - a power & status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex's .   they are almost the  " first wives club "  ,  and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex's involved as well as some  " he left the credit card "  behaviour .  characters set - the movie continues .   mcdowell's character ,  the headmistress ,  arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist ,  filling in for the regular player  ( doughty )  catches her eye .  what will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief ?  will they live happily ever after ?   a tissue or two recommended if you're the teary type - the end uplifting ,  but maybe not what you'd expect .  all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action ,  special effects and schlock horror . 
the movie freddy's dead the final nightmare is just as horrific and disturbing as every other nightmare on elm street  ,  yes it has comedy essence about it  ,  so has all the other films ,  but how can anyone possibly say that you wouldn't find freddy krueger scary  ,  if you were to come across this man in your dreams you wouldn't find him even more scary with a comic essence about him because his comedy shows that he doesn't care at all about killing you that he finds it extremely funny ,  and freddy also plays comic mind games with them ,  which in its own way is very disturbing  ,  by using his comic ways i think that makes the horror movies nightmare on elm street what they are today ,  the writers are extremely clever making krueger comic and scary as oppose to jason vorhees  ,  who doesn't say anything and hasn't got the wit to truly frighten his victims ,  this movie is about as good as freddy's wit gets and i would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour and by the way  "  don't fall asleep !  "  . 
freddy's dead :  the final nightmare  ( 1991 )  was the last film to feature freddy krueger as a solo act  ( not as an entity or a co-star )  .  the years of killing have taken a toll upon the town of springwood .  it has gotten to the point that the little city has become a virtual ghost town .  the parents who killed freddy krueger so many years ago have all paid the ultimate price .  only the mad inhabit the town and the survivors are scattered everywhere .  but that doesn't stop freddy from seeking out his final revenge .  no matter how they try to stop him ,  he always comes back for more .  but this time he finds out a little more about his old life .  can the kids finally stop freddy for good ?  what is this secret that is buried in freddy's twisted mind ?  to find out you'll have to watch freddy's dead .  the end was originally filmed in 3-d .   a fitting way to end the franchise .  freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he gets to go out in a bang !  lisa zane ,  yaphet kotto and freddy krueger star in this final installment .  rosanne ,  tom arnold and johnny depp make special appearances .  a whole lot better than the last one but it's filled with a few dated jokes .  if you enjoy the series then you don't want to miss out on this one .   i have to recommend this movie for freddy fans . 
now all the kids and teenagers of springwood ,  ohio are all dead expect for one teenager  ( shon greenblatt )  is still alive .  freddy  ( robert englund )  is letting him go and the teenager doesn't have much of a memory ,  when he's arriving in a new town .  when a tough female psychologist  ( lisa zane )  tries to break though the new patient .  she's finds out ,  where he's from .  she brings him along to springwood to spark some memories but three teens  ( lezlie deane ,  breckin meyer and ricky dean logan )  ,  who unexpected came for the ride .  once they arrived in springwood ,  the psychologist has some memory that she did lived in that town before as a child .  while freddy knows the true secret of her true identity .   directed by rachel talalay  ( ghost in the machine ,  tank girl )  made a grim but somewhat oddly different sequel with some visual style and funny moments for this horror/fantasy/thriller .  yaphet kotto  ( alien )  has a supporting role as a psychologist expert on dreams .  this has some ingenious visual effects  ( not everyone will love the climax ,  especially in 3-d )  and some good style in its storytelling .  this one did out gross some of the film's series at the box office .   dvd has an strong anamorphic widescreen  ( 1 . 85 : 1 )  transfer  ( also in pan & scan )  and an strong-dolby digital 5 . 1 surround sound .  dvd has the original theatrical trailer ,  jump to a nightmare opinion and cast & crew information .  the  " elm street "  series box set ,  the eighth disc has interviews with the the cast & crew of this sixth film .  the sixth film is also in 3-d for the film climax but you could watch it at 2-d also .  this is the last of the  " elm street "  films until wes craven resurrected freddy into a different ,  darker style in  " new nightmare "  and the silly but surprisingly enjoyable spin-off horror film  " freddy vs jason "  .  watch for robert shaye  ( co-owner and co-ceo of  " new line cinema "  )  ,  roseanne barr ,  tom arnold ,  johnny depp and alice cooper in amusing cameos .  written by michael de luca  ( john carpenter's in the mouth of madness )  .  from a story by the director .   ( *** ½/***** )  . 
freddy has gone from scary to funny , in this 6th installment in the nightmare series .    it's been 2 years , well actually 11 since this film takes place in 2001 . and freddy has killed every last kid on elm street except one , john doe ( jacobb from part 5 , even doe the film gives on hint who he is )  , in which he uses to bring more children to come to elm street . not only does freddy gets his wishes , but he also gets his daughter back to elm street . when she finds out what is happening , she and other kids decide to kill freddy once and for all . we also get to see some of freddy's eerie backgrounds .    rachel talalay , who has been contected to the nightmare series for a long time by now . many people hate this film , but i liked it . it tried to bring out what freddy was doing with his wisecrackes .  .  . comdey and makes the series more funny than scary . so this film is really a comdey sore to speak . it is not the wrost in the series , part 2 still holds it .   
i guess i'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film .  is it one of the best of the  " nightmare "  series ?  maybe not ,  but i had lots of fun with it .  freddy krueger reaches his evil ,  wisecracking potential .  since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down ,  i felt this so-called final installment  (  " new nightmare "  is the real finale )  brought the series out of its slump .  there are some great nightmare sequences ,  including one where breckin meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed ,  falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which freddy controls .  this is both a highly original and hilarious sequence ,  especially when we see him out of the dreamscape ,  hopping around like super mario .  and freddy belts out the funny one-liner ,   " great graphics .  "  and since the movie was made about 10 years ago ,  it brought back memories when freddy started controlling the game with the powerglove .  anyone who remembers the first 8-bit nintendo remembers the powerglove .    the cast is superb .  lisa zane is perfectly cast in the lead .  i haven't seen yaphet kotto since  " the running man ,  "  and i think the last time i saw that film was about 5 years ago .  he's another great ,  underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence .  and who can forget the cameos ?  the best one is by johnny depp  ( from the first  " nightmare "  )  playing a spokesman for an anti-drug commercial .    the 3d sequence at the end is really awesome !  so for those who are looking to check this film out--please rent or buy it on dvd !  hopefully all the editions come with the 3d glasses ,  but i'm sure the video edition has the 3d element removed .    i personally didn't see many things wrong with the film .  it even elaborated on freddy's backstory .  the film is a great mix of humor and scares ,  and the gross-out effects are terrific .  could this have given better justice to the franchise ?  of course it could have .  but rachel talalay did a fine job .  and finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done .   and in closing ,  i loved the montage over the opening credits .  fans of the series will be delighted ,  and will look at it as a tribute to beloved freddy .    my score :  7  ( out of 10 ) 
this is a great show ,  and will make you cry ,  this group people really loved each other in real life and it shows time and time again .  email me and let's chat .  i have been to australia and they real do talk like this .   i want you to enjoy five mile creek and pass on these great stories of right and wrong ,  and friendship to your kids .  i have all 40 episodes on dvd-r that i have collected over the last 5 years .  see my five mile creek tribute at www . mikeandvicki . com and hear the extended theme music .  let's talk about them .   these people are so cool ! 
in the opening scenes of this movie a man shot arrows through his hotel room into another man's bathroom and blew out all the lights .  this must have been very hep for 1936 ,  but rather way way out and had nothing to do with the film ,  robin hood did not make an appearance as far as i could see .  however ,  bette davis ( daisey appleby )  ,  " the whales of august "  , '87 was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in hollywood .  daisey never stopped teasing or being very sexy with her nightgowns and so called swim suit on her yacht with george brent ( johnny jones )  ,  " the spiral staircase "  , '46 .  daisey even proposed marriage to johnny in a ferris wheel upside down and even got a black eye .  davis and brent made a great couple ,  one suppose to be very rich and the other a very poor reporter .  off stage ,  davis and brent were having a real torrid love affair ,  which is good reason why there was sparks when these two appeared in this film .  if you liked bette davis and george brent ,  this is the film for you ! 
this is an excellent example of early bette davis talent .  the production is above average for 1936 timeframe .  i cannot understand why the owners of the rights to this film have not put it on dvd .  owners ,  please please release it .  i would buy it immediately .  i have not seen it in more than thirty years ,  on television ,  but remember it well . 
at first sight this movie doesn't look like a particular great one .  after all a bette davis movies with only 166 votes on imdb and a rating of 6 , 5 must be a rather bad one .  but the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise .   you would at first expect that this is a normal average typical '30's movie with a formulaic love-story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story ,  which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch .   the story is carried by its two main characters played by bette davis and george brent .  their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two .  their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love-story that work humorous as well .  it makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch ,  that is perfectly entertaining .   the movie is quite short  ( just over an hour long )  ,  which means that the story doesn't waste any time on needless plot lines ,  development and characters .  it makes the movie also rather fast paced ,  which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well .  it does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or fun .   a delightful pleasant simple romantic-comedy that deserves to be seen by more !   8/10
crush provides a combination of drama ,  humor and such irony that i find the english establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart .  mostly known for directing john mckay wrote this wonderful screenplay about three forty-something friends in a small town in england .  all three professional women down-out of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin ,  fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos .  andie macdowell once again thrown by the surrounds of the british  ( which is where i find she exudes the most )  is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man .  small town gossip and the disapproving jealous friends  ( great supporting cast )  conflicts with her relationship .  unfolding a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness .  keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that .  this is the type of film you either love or hate ,  which is why i believe a lot of mix reviews and not that greatest success resulted when this film was released .  as i'm sure most are just unearthing the film now .  i very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as  " love actually "  ,  and  " three weddings and a funeral "  .  not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary perfectly capturing those crucial moments . 
this film got terrible reviews but because it was offbeat and because critics don't usually  " get "  offbeat films ,  i thought i'd give it a try .  unfortunately they were largely right in this instance .   the film just has an awkward feel too it that is most off putting .  the sort of feel that is impossible to describe ,  but it's not a good one .  to further confound things ,  the script is a dull aimless thing that is only vaguely interesting .   the immensely talented thurman just drifts through this mess creating barely an impact .  hurt and bracco try in vain to add something to the film with enthusiastic performance but there is nothing in the script .  it may have been less embarrassing for them if they had merely chosen to drift and get it over with like thurman .   one thing the  " esteemed "  film critics did fail to mention however is that the film is actually quite funny .  whether it be moments of accurate satire or some outrageously weird moments like when the cowgirls in question chase hurt off their ranch with the smell of their unwashed .  .  . ahem .  .  . front bottoms .   because of the chortles acheived throughout ,  while i wouldn't recommend this film ,  there is entertainment to be had and watching even cowgirls get the blues is worthwhile for something different . 
this was an excellent film .  i don't understand why so many people don't like it .  there was so much in it to connect with ,  so many beautiful images ,  and so much compassion in the things that weren't said .  i was thoroughly entertained ,  and was left with a feeling of joyous exuberance ,  just as i am when i finish most any tom robbins story .  now i haven't read this particular book of robbin's ,  so i don't now how this matched up ,  but i can't imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation .  the movie left a lot for you to define yourself ,  which is the best part of any tom robbins novel ,  dreaming up the details .    to all of you who said this was the worst movie ever ,  i pity what little must be left of the dimming light in your hearts .  far from the worst ever this movie was glorious .  long live the whooping crane . 
i admit ,  the first time i watched even cowgirls get the blues ,  i didn't think it was very memorable in any regard .  but now after viewing it the 7th time ,  i admit that it has very much grown on me .  the characters of sissy ,  ms .  jellybean ,  and the countess have become very endearing .  and the romance between sissy and jellybean seems very sweet .  though the plot is very weak ,  i think the satirical humor more than makes up for it .  then there's the kick-ass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented k . d .  lang  ( who reminds me a little of patsy cline )  at her best .  i can't think of any movie that has  " grown on me "  after an inauspicious first impression ,  as much as cowgirls has . 
worst movie of all time ?  wow ,  whoa now .  you cannot be serious .   maybe it's all about what you expect a movie to do to you .  i live in oregon ,  so i got to enjoy the beautifully-filmed shots of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful smith rocks and other areas in central oregon  ( as well as the sweet cameo of our own ken kesey and ken babbs looking down on baby sissy's cradle at the beginning of the movie )  .  those alone were enough to spur me to give the movie a better than  " average "  score .   or  .  .  .  .  maybe it's all about what expectations you have .  having read the book ages ago ,  and thinking to myself  " goodness ,  no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting ,  quirky ,  weird book  .  .  .  especially 20 years later ,  when mores  ( morays -- can't put in the accent mark online )  have changed "  -- i was actually quite pleasantly surprised when i first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it again .   sissy was exquisitely cast ,  and i don't care what you all say ,  i was also pleasantly surprised at rain phoenix's and john hurt's performances .  i am not a lesbian nor bi nor trans ,  but have met many folks who are similar to the folks they were supposed to portray -- and those  " real "  folks kinda acted the same way as these actors acted .  stilted a bit ,  stage-ey -- always a bit  " on .  "  gus van sant is one weird native oregonian but by garsh he done a good job adapting this crazy book ,  imho . 
the film is exceptional in it's gay iconography and extends this beyond the asthetics to the music and cast .  throughout the whole film exists a childlike wonder as seen through the eyes of the main character .  her lighthearted take on the world around us is comical and beautiful .  in a way it's a slacker movie for girls .  watch this is you fancy a relaxing entertaining mid-night movie .  buy this if you like diferent takes on the world of media and love combined  (  ?  )  . 
i saw this movie the first seconds the voice of t . r .  took me on to the journey - well i disliked the big glued thumbs in the beginning ,  but the absurd humor it and the gordious looks of both sissy actors - i do not know who played the young her - but she was great and so was uma !  !  !  -  the two other people who where in the cinema went out after about half an hour ,  i was with a friend - and it is always a test to watch a movie i like good with one of my friends - and ,  we both enjoyed it too the maximum - hilarious laughs - sadness about the  " realistic police- normalos "   .  both of us fans of t . robbins books .  .  . i found it well done - thought ,  that robbins would also approve ,  though i do not have an idea if he likes the film or not .  .  .   i would love to see the cut out stuff - i heard that gus v .  sand had to take out lots of scenes because of the first-time viewers  ( or the producers ?  ?  ?  )  well still it is an artistic movie .  much too short though .  .  .  it is one of my all time favorites - and i am aware of it that the majority of people can't stand that kind of movie and assume that people who enjoy that films are whatever they think  .  .  .  .  .  .  . what a pity .  hopefully there will come the day that there will be a dvd with the full material - hoping to see more of crispian ,  keanu - expecting to see her baby and all  if you have the chance to see it ,  think twice ,  and enjoy it if you made the choice to watch  .  .  .  m
if you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by tom robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole-hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art .  the actors and the direction of this film are both good .    the only trouble with the film ,  as i can see it ,  is that robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond hollywood's capabilities at the time this film was shot .   given both the irreverence of today's movies ,  as well as the willingness and abilityof today's audiences to delve into the bizarre ,  i think  " even cowgirls .  .  .  would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released . 
i feel very sorry for people who go to movies with a pad and pencil to write down flaws and keep notes on how bad a movie is .  i feel equally contempt for people who go to movies and can't suspend reality and/or let themselves enjoy 90 minutes aways from their boring or busy lives !  get a grip people .  ecgtb is a very entertaining movie .  if you take movies seriously ,  this is not for you .  if you are expecting the movie to resemble the book in any way ,  this is not for you .  but if you enjoyed the utter hilarity of priscilla queen of the desert ,  or the  " what the hell am i watching "  of moulin rouge .  or the gross out comedy of  " the sweetest thing "  then let yourself escape to cowgirls .  it has some really funny parts .  hilarious actually .  it also has some really good music ; kudos to kd . lang .  also did i mention it has 90 minutes of uma thurman .  .  .  .  . need i say more ? 
gus van sant has made some excellent films .  i truly am a fan .   however ,  i can't help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book  " even cowgirls get the blues "  is lost in translation to the big screen .  alone ,  tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent .  ultimately though this one just didn't work .    it wasn't that the characters weren't well developed or the plot and content didn't come alive .  it's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this .  we're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author's precision .  movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller-coaster detracting from the overall experience .  this is what i believe happened here .   i suggest reading the book ! 
i could not agree less with the rating that was given to this movie ,  and i believe this is a sample of how short minded most of spectators are all over the world .  really .  .  .  are you forgetting that cinema used to be a kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it only entertainment ?  this movie is not entertainment ,  at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like titanic or gladiator .  it has style ,  it is different ,  it is shocking .  .  .  that's why most of you have hated it so much :  because it does not try to be pleasing to you .  it's just a story ,  a very weird one i admit ,  but after all ,  only a weird story .  it is not a great story ,  not even a great cinema work ,  but i believe it is worth a 7-stars rating only for the courage of both author and director to shot a story that is not made to please the audience ,  thus selling billions of copies and making the big studios even richer .  this movie is ,  for me ,  european-artistic-like movie made in the us ,  and everyone involved in the making of it deserves respect .  be it for the courage ,  or be it for the unique sense of humor . 
i recently found a copy for $5 at a video store ,  and snapped it up eagerly .  while the music and  ( obviously )  graphics aren't up to the standards of my favorite of the series ,  beyond the mind's eye ,  i am still entranced by one segment :   stanley and stella in  " breaking the ice "  .  the music is brilliant ,  and the emotions feel real .  the clip on odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music ,  unfortunately . 
when this first came out ,  my dad brought it home- we were amazed by it- it was so different from anything we had seen before .  i was looking for a specific movie last night ,  and i found  " the mind's eye "  again .  the box is falling apart ,  and i am surprised that the tape still works !  although it is not 'finding nemo' quality graphics ,  it is still very good .  they should sell this again- it is a landmark for computer animation imagery .  highly recommended !   this is what it is :    " the mind's eye "  is a spectacular odyssey through time .  your journey begins at the dawn of creation and moves through the rise of man and technology .  travel in the world of abstraction and on into the future with breathtaking computer animation imagery .    " the mind's eye "  joins the imaginations of over 300 of the world's most talented computer animation artists with a powerful ,  original music soundtrack .  this unique collaboration takes you on an incredible voyage into  " the mind's eye .  " 
kenny doughty as jed willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star ,  even though he keeps his pants on .   the movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life .  i don't think i can think of another movie ,  except perhaps zeffirelli's romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that well .   the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously .  in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery ,  without the mayhem .   this is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages .

i loved the real mc coys  ( 1957-1963 )  it is too bad that lydia reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear .  she was excellent in the show .  of course walter brennan was great as well as tony martínez .  i loved it when he called amos señor grampa . i have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons 2-6 . if only there would be more shows on television like this one ,  everything would be better .  this show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared .  god bless all the departed members of the cast and please , llydia reed ,  make yourself known again to the public .  you are loved and respected .  the real mc coys will live forever . 
as a kid ,  i loved computer animation although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost nonexistent .  this movie ,  as i sat in awe and watched the amazing images and almost-hypnotic music ,  shaped the desire in me to create moving things in the computer .  this is a whole-package deal ,  between the music and the video ,  that really packs a one-two punch .  if you know any child that wants to get involved in computer animation ,  this is a must have .    i still ,  almost 20 years later ,  rate this movie as one of my top 3 favorites .  the originality ,  i think ,  is still unsurpassed by most of today's mcmovies that hollywood spits out .  i am currently wanting to see if i can re-make it on my own ;  if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this movie deserves a ton of imitation = ) 
these things have been floating around in my head for damn near 10 years now .  some pieces of this work were really memorable .  - id love to see another more current example of cg showy offy stuff .  actually i'd love to be part of it .   if i'd would of had the chance to just say what i wanted and thats it ,  i wouldn't have to write all this extra in order to make  " 10 lines if text "  as this website requires .  i mean really ?  this almost discourages me ,  i mean luckily for the guys that made the movie i really liked the minds eye - and it took me 3 times to have enough lines ,  i hope you don't get me on the misspelling .  - yup you did . 
this has to be the all time best computer animation classic .  even though most of the animations where experiments .  they have an artistic quality that has stood the test of time .  twelve years after it's release ,  i have gone back to watch this video and found some inspiration for new types of computer graphics .  some of the techniques used in this video have never been full explored . 
i probably saw this movie first in about 1995 .  since then i've returned to it many times .  it's great !  i especially like the first and second clips ,   " creation "  and  " civilization rising .  "  wow !  this was so cool back in the glory days of cg animation .  cg is way older than i am ,  as i know the film  " tron "  was made 7 years before my time .  but this film was a landmark in the early '90s .  it was probably the first collaboration of different cg experiments set to music .  i like it so much ,  i think i'll go watch it now .  bye
this is an  " odysessy through time "  via computer animation ,  supposedly th work of over 300 artists .  made in the late '80s and released in 1990 ,  this was cutting edge stuff for the day .  i thought it was good and quite interesting in spots .   most of the short scenes made no sense ,  just forms evolving into other forms ,  but that was fun to watch .  this is all about visuals ,  not really about any kind of a story .  there were some strange sequences in which odd-looking men- creatures would dance around with birds overheard .  all of it is computer animated which was new back then .  even the term  " computer animated "  was not well-known .   it's simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoon-like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes .  no words ,  just pictures with electronic music .  stoners must have really loved this .   it's a nice ,  intriguing 40 minutes of  " eye candy "  and  " head candy .  "  by today's cg effects this may have lost impact ,  but i think you'd still be entertained by this . 
well ,  well .  .  .  . roeg touched a bit of a nerve there ,  didn't he ?  he was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters' descents into psychosis for a couple of decades ,  but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption  ( or even some good advice )  might be found in the bad old catholic church ,  the hipper-than-thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious .  worse still ,  theresa russell's character - faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for ,  is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level - that of the spiritual .  you know ,  the realm of the ignorant and superstitious ,  the sort of thing that the art-house cinephiles are supposed to be above .  oh ,  the horror .  .  .  so she finds her marriage - the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention .  people who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives .  but they probably won't .  sure ,  this film has some problems ,  notably talia shire's delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun ,  1950s-style attire and all .  and the dialogue between marie davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the spellbound school of glib interpretations  ( though hitchcock's movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a freudian psychoanalyst )  .  but ,  sadly ,  nicolas roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents . 
after reading the other tepid reviews and comments ,  i felt i had to come to bat for this movie .   roeg's films tend to have little to do with one another ,  and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark .   what this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith .  the only other film like it-in terms of its religious message-would have to be tolkin's `the rapture . '  i am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural .  it is a simple movie about catholic faith ,  miracles ,  and redemption--though you would never guess it till the end .  it is also the only movie i can think of whose resolution turns ,  literally ,  on a pun .   as a  ( happily )  fallen catholic myself ,  i know what the movie is about ,  and i find a sort of fondness in its ultimate innocence about the relation between god and man .  but if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based ,  then it will go right over you head .   as a film-as opposed to a story-`cold heaven' it is not ground-breaking .  while `the rapture' is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery ,  `cold heaven' downplays its own cinematic qualities .  there are no striking shots ,  no edgy effects ,  no attempts to fit the content to the form .  it is workmanlike shooting ,  but subdued .  nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama .  it is a simple story that unfolds simply .  it may seem odd ;  but at the end the mystery is revealed .  it looks ambiguous ;  but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of catholic dogma .   in this regard ,  `cold heaven' has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like `the sting , ' or `the sixth sense , ' or `final descent , ' or polanski's `a pure formality . ' all of these are films with a trick up their sleeves .  they may frustrate you along the way ,  but they have a point-an obvious one ,  indeed--but the fun is ,  at least in part ,  in having been taken in .   still ,  even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line ,  it is worth watching for way it directs-and misdirects-you .  try it-especially if you are ,  or have ever been ,  a catholic . 
i loved this movie .  in fact i loved being an actress in this movie .  iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie .  you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film .  i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector .  in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake .  thumbs up to full moon high .  wish it come to cable soon .  cheryl lockett alexander leesville ,  louisiana i loved this movie .  in fact i loved being an actress in this movie .  iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie .  you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film .  i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector .  in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake .  thumbs up to full moon high .  wish it come to cable soon .  cheryl lockett alexander  leesville ,  louisiana
no doubt intended as a totally campy joke ,   " full moon high "  portrays 1950s teenager tony walker  ( adam arkin )  accompanying his father  ( ed mcmahon )  on a trip to romania .  sure enough ,  tony gets bitten ,  and grows fur and fangs whenever there's a full moon .  a particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can't age as long as he has the werewolf curse ,  and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years .   but otherwise ,  the movie's just plain funny once it gets going .  ed mcmahon's character is an over-patriotic right-wing yahoo  ( he thinks that everyone should have listened to joe mccarthy )  ,  kenneth mars's coach/principal is a tense dweeb ,  and then there's more .  one of the most eye-opening cast members is demond wilson - best remembered as lamont on  " sanford and son "  - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise .  but probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents ;  then gag with gerald ford really summed him up !  anyway ,  it's a real treat .  considering that alan arkin - who plays a zany psychiatrist - just won an oscar on sunday night and thanked his sons ,  i wonder whether or not he remembers co-starring with two of them in this movie  ( aside from adam ,  his son anthony also has a small role )  .  quite funny .  also starring elizabeth hartman .   ps :  director larry cohen is probably best known for the killer baby flick  " it's alive "  . 
having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on rialto channel i found it to be a pleasant ,  poignant and enriching film .    the casting was excellent .  i loved all the characters ,  they were a little exaggerated in places ,   ( but this is a film )  .  the way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly ,  as real life can and does .  yes ,  i thought andy macdowell was great .  i was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities  ( i find this quite wierd because she's always a solid actress in my opinion )  .   i loved the bit at the end where andy's character said  " sometimes i feel he was never here "  etc .  ,  it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that  ( which i can personally identify with )  ,  then there was that gorgeous classical piece  " nocturne "  i think by chopin ,  which was a beautiful way to end  ( bar the light comedy at the end ,  which was probably unnecessary )  .   i say  " well done "  to the film makers - i have seen 1 , 000s of worse films ! 
full moon high  ( 1981 )  3 of 5 dir :  larry cohen stars :  adam arkin ,  ed mcmahon ,  roz kelly  tony  ( arkin )  is your average ordinary high school guy .  prepping for the big homecoming game ,  girlfriend trouble and growing hair in strange placesyou know the usual .  but the hair in strange places part gets a wee bit out of control when a trip to transylvania with his father  ( yes !  mcmahon )  leaves him with a wicked case of the furballs .  now doomed to walk the world forever young as a werewolf how will adam get any girls ?   'full moon high' is not often talked about but it is a silly and entertaining horror spoof .  larry cohen  ( q the winged serpent ,  the stuff )  incorporates as many gags as he can possibly come up with as writer / director .  arkin  ( h20 :  halloween ,  20 years later )  shows nice timing in the lead role .  if you happen to be a fan of spoofs like 'airplane' and 'student bodies' i think you'll have fun with this chuckle-fest . 
it' just funny ,  watch it !  !  !    ok they want 10 lines so there :  this is a spoof of 50s/70s werewolf movies .  lots of satire ,  some political .  feels like an early clouseau movie  ( probably due to alan arkin )  ,  but with less slap stick .  if you like the naked guns movies you'll like this too  ( once again less slapstick in this one )  .    actually ,  the humor ranges from light sexual innuendo  ( unavoidable in a teen comedy )  ,  to really poignant socio-political satire .  the transformation of the moon high school from 50s to 70s is really funny .  the sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant !  ok maybe not brilliant but still hilarious .  there are tons of  ( histarical )  cracks starting from the 50s cold war paranoia and the late 70s inflation .   anyway ,  just watch the movie if you get a chance ! 
in this send-up of horror films ,  50's cold war paranoia ,  reagan-era america ,  and high school films ,  adam arkin plays tony ,  the star quarterback of full moon high in the 1950's .  he and his father  ( ed mcmahon )  travel to communist romania and while he's lost in the streets one night ,  he is bitten by a werewolf .  when he returns stateside ,  he cannot control his animalistic urges and goes on a killing spree .  frustrated ,  he flees town .  decades later ,  the immortal tony returns to town and re-enrolls in highschool .  he still can't control his transformations ,  and the townspeople ,  and his friends ,  realize he's not quite human .  it all culminates during the schools big football game .   i expected this to be one of those 'so bad it's good' films from the early 80's .  but i was surprised that the film was actually ,  legitimately funny .  the cast ,  including kenneth mars as a pervy coach ,  roz kelly as tony's lusty former flame ,  demond wilson as a bus driver ,  and alan arkin as a oddball doctor ,  go all out ,  with hilarious results .   while watching this film i was struck by how similar the writing and humor were to 'family guy . ' 'full moon high' has that same anything goes attitude and never takes itself seriously . 
while visiting romania with his cia dad ,  tony ( adam arkin )  ,  quite a talented high school quarterback seen as the savior to lead his team finally to a victory over rival simpson ,  is told by a would-be palm-reader (  .  . in romania ,  the people are not allowed many books ,  so she took up palm reading ) that he would be bitten by a werewolf (  " when the moon is full ,  don't make any appointments .  . you will be busy .  "  )  .  well ,  who would have thunk it .  . tony is in fact bitten and his life would be forever changed .  after his father unfortunately dies in a mishap within his bomb shelter (  !  ) under odd circumstances ( firing at his werewolf son inside a metallic bomb shelter isn't a very good idea ,  especially if the bullet doesn't leave the room and bounces around like a pinball gone berserk )  ,  tony travels the land through endless years ,  until he's tired of packing ,  and returns decades (  .  . and many us presidents ) later to hopefully lead his football team to a win over simpson .  . a task he abandoned long ago .  what was once a very white ,  clean-cut high school has indeed changed into a ghetto of drug use ,  violence ,  and perversion .  to get an idea of what the early 80's full moon high school's prom party resembles ,  think studio 54 with teenagers .  .   larry cohen's parody of werewolf flicks ,  among others things ,  is crammed full of gags ,  homages ,  and in-jokes .  my favorite sequences contain one in the sex-ed classroom where tony reveals to the 80's class his werewolf transformation and the introductory scene to dr .  brand ( alan arkin ,  who steals the film when kenneth mars isn't on screen )  ,  quite possibly the worst psychiatrist on earth .  his task to talk down a jumper leads to two men falling off a balcony .  . the jumper and a fireman  ( trying ,  at first ,  to talk him out of it )  ,  both fuming mad at brand !  brand even tries to get tony to sign a waver for his body's being donated to science so he can get his wife a fur coat !  kenneth mars had me rolling in the floor as a homosexual football coach (  .  . and later in the 80's as the principal ) who likes to pat his players on the behind .  . his scene where tony's unloading the truth to the sex-ed class is classic .  the film is loaded with inspired casting choices .  . just littered with funny characters and the cast interpretations .  . such as ed mcmahon as a very conservative military blowhard who actually looks identical to joseph mccathy standing next to his photo in the bomb shelter (  .  . always talking about commies )  ,  joanne nail as bulging eyed ricky in present day who falls for the werewolf ,  elizabeth hartman ( a patch of blue ) as a mousy ,  nerdy sexually molested (  .  . and molester ) teacher who finds an attraction towards tony ,  james dixon as a deputy (  .  . his great scene has him stealing a line from his police chief reciting it to dr .  brand who begins mouthing the words to himself for memorization )  ,  roz kelly as jane ,  an undyingly devoted female desiring tony for only herself constantly demanding he ravish her ,  and bill kirchenbauer as flynn ,  tony's long-time pal and now the police chief who only got jane after his friend left town .  can not forget jm j bullock as flynn's closeted gay son trying to fit in at the school hoping to find a dame with hilarious results .   i like how the film pays homage to the werewolf genre such as when he's on the prowl .  . he's often referred to in the papers as jack the nipper because he likes to bite his victims on the cheek .  . and i'm not talking face .  he's seen more as an annoyance than danger .  the homages to carrie and psycho are nice ,  and the violin shtick is also amusing .  cohen tosses so many zingers at the viewer ,  eventually one has to stick .  obviously in a comedy such as this ,  not every joke hits it's mark ,  but many do .  the cast makes this worthwhile .  the film looks cheap on the typical larry cohen budget .  notice the 50's scenes where the obvious old cast members that would show up down the road wear glaring wigs .  loved adam in the lead .  . he is the perfect foil for the gags that follow him and the zingers he lets fly from cohen's script .  the film moves quickly ,  rarely catching a breath .  i liked this horror comedy more than most it seems . 
i'm not kidding about that summary and vote !  the video distributors have packaged this as just another typical '80s werewolf movie ,  but it is in fact the greatest parody of the horror genre that you can imagine ,  having done for the horror movie what  " blazing saddles "  did for the western .  i have seen plenty of comedies - good ,  bad ,  stupid ,  weird ,  etc .   ( usually walking away unimpressed )  ,  and i think that comedy must be the most difficult genre for filmmakers and actors to work in - it takes just the right kind of touch to make things successful ,  and part of that is having good ideas .   " full moon high "  is bulging with good ideas - so many ,  in fact ,  that it can easily put the zucker/abrams team of  " airplane "  and  " naked gun "  to shame .  one of the best of these is the very presence of ed mcmahon in a starring role as a john birch-style right-wing crackpot .  the jokes ,  non-sequiturs ,  wisecracks and word-play are literally non-stop and everything ,  including the kitchen sink ,  has been thrown in .  the ironic tone is very similar to that of  " back to the future .  "    some people  ( i . e .  almost every reviewer here )  must have been turned off by the spirit of anarchy here ,  but i almost died of laughter ,  and this is one of those movies in which you never know what kind of insane situation will transpire next .  since b-movie extraordinaire larry cohen had not made a straight comedy before this ,  one gets the sense that he was making up for lost time by including any joke he or his collaborators could think of .  if mel brooks had made this ,  the critics would have labelled it a comic masterpiece ,  but because it was made by cohen ,  it has been dismissed as schlock .  critical reviews have called this movie too  " silly .  "  silly ?  what is a comedy supposed to be - serious ?  !  anyway ,  i laughed out loud more for this movie than any other i can think of .  cohen makes fun of everyone - himself included ,  with plenty of references to his usual brand of low-rent film-making ;  he and the actors must have had a complete blast making this .   the humor is very mel brooks-ish ,  and anyone who loves jewish humor or watches a lot of b-movies  ( especially horror )  will love this .  trust me :  the movie isn't too hard to find ,  and as long as you accept it for what it is - a roller-coaster of belly laughs with no pretense of social value whatsoever - then you'll truly enjoy it !  !   one sidenote :  this movie should somehow go down in history as the one thing bob saget ever starred in  ( albeit briefly )  that was actually funny . 
silly movie is really ,  really funny .  yes ,  it's got its dead moments ,  it can be a bit too obvious ,  it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess ,  but it's laugh out loud funny all the way .  and it's worth seeing just for ed mcmahon as a right wing kook .  this movie is in the same class as elvira ,  mistress of the dark ,  another incredibly funny ,  underappreciated film . 
i don't know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but i enjoyed this one as i'm a fan of urban horror .  there's not too many urban horror movies out there so when i saw this one on the shelf ,  just the title alone peaked my curiosity .  so i decided to check it out and i was surprised .  .  . it's not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with great acting and a good story .  is it low budget ?  yes .  can you tell that it's low budget ?  yes .  .  . but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesn't matter .  i like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice !  i don't know what's up with all these bad reviews for this film .  all i hear is  " worst movie ever "  .  have these idiots seen every movie out there ?  there's thousands of movies out there ,  how can you categorize one as the  " worst "  ever ?  a video not  " movie "  like  " zombiez "  may be the worst film i ever seen but i can't say that it's the worst movie ever since i haven't seen every movie out there .  bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs .  listen ,  if you don't like minority based ,  urban films ,  the ghetto films ,  hip hop , etc then why watch these types of movies ?  ?  ?  !  !  !  knowing that you don't like this type of stuff ?  sure ,  this is a horror film but it's not just a horror film but it's an urban horror film with a multi-cultural based cast .  i don't like tv shows like dawson's creek or the o . c .  ,  they suck to me .  films like  " garden state "  ,   " wedding crashers "  and  " i heart huckabees "  suck to me .  i'm a guy from new jersey and these shows and movies suck to me .  why ?  because i can't relate to them .  they don't peak my interest .  just common sense .  believe me ,  i will never watch garden state 2 :  garden salad ,  wedding crashers 2 :  here's a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and i heart huckaboring .  now back to this movie ,  in regards to saint405's comment above ,  i don't know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked  " stupid "  by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me ,  everyone did a great job .  the actor who played ricky  ( i forgot his name )  did a very good job .  i'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off .  anywho ,  i liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet i'll be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this ,  bring on the sequel !  !  !  i'm out .  jerzee representin' ! 
welcome to oakland ,  where the dead come out to play and even the boys in da hood can't stop them .  this low-budget ,  direct-to-video production seems timed to coincide with the release of land of the dead ,  the latest installment of george a .  romero's famed zombie series .  the ghetto setting and hip-hop soundtrack may provide additional appeal for inner- city gore hounds .  ricky  ( carl washington )  works at a medical research facility while raising his kid brother ,  jermaine  ( brandon daniels )  .  but the teenager ,  bored by macaroni-and-cheese dinners in their tract house ,  would rather spend his time hanging with street friends marco and kev .  apparently there is not a lot for african-american high-school dropouts to do on this side of the bay except deal drugs and scuffle with the homeys ,  including rival latino gang bangers .  ricky plans to sell their late parents' house and move inland to the castro valley ,  a more middle-class and presumably safer environment .  unfortunately ,  before this can happen ,  a drive-by shooting leaves jermaine dead on the porch .  grief-stricken ricky tries a last desperate ploy .  he tells scotty ,  his lab assistant ,  to steal some of the experimental cell regeneration formula they have been testing on rats .  when a double dose fails to revive jermaine ,  there is no choice except to call 911 .  but a funny thing happens on the way to the morgue .  the boy is reanimated as a sputtering ,  growling zombie ,  chews the ambulance drivers and staggers off into the night ,  bent on revenge and hungry for fresh meat .  the feeding frenzy infects more victims ,  and before the night is over the east bay is a battleground between the living and the blood-spattered undead .  the horror genre has seen more than its share of cheap movie makers ,  from ed wood to herschel gordon lewis to charles band .  but low budgets do not necessarily mean bad films .  consider val lewton's programmers  ( cat people ,  the leopard man ,  isle of the dead )  ,  roger corman's poe quickies ,  romero's night of the living dead and john carpenter's halloween .  the difference between memorable and awful has more to do with talent and ambition than money .  hood of the living dead is more fun than several hundred million dollars' worth of recent high-priced horrors .  cheapness has its charms .  in truly cheap films actors wear their own clothes amid real settings .  here the tract houses have freshly painted walls in neutral matte tones ,  lending a bleakness as oppressive as douglas sirk's bourgeois melodramas of the '50s .  lines seem more improvised than scripted .   " so what the hell are we gonna do now ?  "   " just keep your eyes open for any f n' thing that looks out of the ordinary .  "  ricky and scotty call their boss ,  who calls an ex-military man named romero .   " i have a huge bitch of a problem that we have to take care of fast .  "   " not a problem ,  "  says the merc ,  closing his phone and grabbing his guns .  everybody has guns ,  and even when fighting zombies they're on their cell phones ,  as who isn't nowadays ?  information is exchanged with naturalistic understatement .   " what happened ?  "   " we got into it with some crazy motherfockers .  "   " deja f n' vu .  it's that park zombie again .   .  .  .  "  ricky even has to blow his twitching girlfriend away ,  saying only ,   " she's gotten out of hand .  "  unlike most zombie movies ,  this one provides a motive for mayhem .  jermaine takes revenge on the gang bangers who shot him ,  who in turn continue the rumble .  this is urban film-making that implies its own social commentary ,  a near-guerrilla production suggesting a future for low-budget horror that reflects real life instead of supernatural clichés .  the brothers quiroz ,  who have trademarked their name as if in anticipation of a new movement ,  may inspire others to tell stories arising from personal experience rather than imitating tired hollywood product .  considering their limited resources ,  jose and eduardo quiroz have made a cheap but technically acceptable feature about people they know .  photographer rocky robinson gets the job done ,  music by eduardo quiroz is no simpler than carpenter's haunting halloween theme ,  and hip-hop songs by the darkroom familia and others add atmosphere .  the result is promising if not exactly exhilarating .  they are learning their craft and ,  unlike lewis and wood ,  who never got any better ,  their next may be one to watch . 
let's get some things straight first :  zombies don't exist so the filmmaker can have them walk ,  run ,  hell even fly if he wants to .  that's what makes this original zombie movie so good .  everything they did was so damn original .  i hate it when filmmakers do everything like romero or when fan boys expect everything like romero .  some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical romero movie ,  once again zombies don't exist so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants .  the zombies in this movie all look very good but obviously they are not decaying corpses since they just freaking died !  they are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood .  one of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat .  it looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it .  this movie got really good reviews in fangoria and rue morgue so that made me want to go see it .  i'm glad i listened .  they are always right when it comes to real horror fan's tastes .  10 out of 10 !  go rent it ! 
this is a refreshing ,  enjoyable movie .  if you enjoyed ,   " four weddings and a funeral "  ,   " peter's friends "  ,  etc .  ,  you will see a number of familiar and talented actors .  made me laugh ,  made me sad .  i view movies for entertainment ,  and english-set movies generally fit that bill for me .  enjoy ! 
there have been  " race "  pictures almost from the beginnings of the movie business .  films starring almost entirely black casts have been made by segregated poverty row studios  ( more often than not owned by caucasians )  for ghetto theaters .  with the growing urban blight during the 1970s ,  this idea was revived with a wave of  " blaxploitation "  pictures made for urban grind houses which overlaid black actors and funky atmosphere over traditional b- movie plots .  this trend even spread into horror features ,  with titles like blacula ,  blackenstein and sugar hill serving up blaxploitation versions of monster standards .  and it didn't die with the closing of most urban theaters  it just slowly eased into the video age ,  and continues with low budget direct-to-dvd releases like this one .  ed and jose quiroz's hood of the living dead ,  adopts the recent popularity of horror movies for the hip-hop audience .  ricky  ( carl washington )  is a young scientist in oakland trying to keep his younger brother jermaine  ( brandon daniels )  out of trouble after the death of their parents .  after jermaine is shot by drug dealers in a drive-by ,  ricky decides to use the experimental cell regenerating formula he's been working on in an attempt to save the teen's life .  apparently his efforts are for naught ,  and jermaine's body is taken away .  however ,  the body never makes it to the morgue  jermaine re-animates in the coroner's van as a flesh-hungry zombie .  he kills the drivers ,  then goes after the gang that killed him ,  spreading the zombie infection wherever he goes .  having heard from jermaine's friends kevin  ( derek taylor ii )  and marco  ( raul martinez )  about the attack on the gangsters ,  ricky feels that the only thing to do is to capture jermaine and try to cover up the whole matter before he and his accomplice scott  ( chris angelo )  get arrested for the mayhem they've caused .  however ,  they soon find that the contagion is spreading too fast for them to control it .  by keeping things simple ,  the quiroz team manages to produce an entertaining little horror feature without overextending themselves to the point where things start to look shoddy .  along the way ,  they also add in a few interesting bits of business .  when first confronted with a zombie ,  scott tells ricky ,   " shoot him in the head like in the movies !  "   an effective as any way to discover how to kill zombies .  an extra twist is added when the first head shot doesn't kill the brain ,  adding to viewer unease .  another good point is that the soundtrack makes only limited use of sub-eminem style rap ,  laying in standard  " creepy "  music throughout . 
i'll be honest .  i got this movie so i could make fun of it .  i mean ,  come on ,   " hood of the living dead "  ?  what other reaction could i have ?  the thing is ,  though ,  the movie  ( and its makers )  decided that it wasn't going to be made fun of .  instead ,  it was going to try its best to be a good movie .   and you know what ?  it came awfully close .  a little less cheese in the incidental music ,  a little more professionalism in the photography ,  the acting ,  the incidentals  ( like the props--love the best buy bag )  .  .  . well ,  it's not a classic of the zombie movie genre ,  but it's still a pretty neat little movie on its own .  and the acting ,  writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than i would have expected .  there's even some decent humor ,  as two of our leads debate how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead .   if you can overlook the low budget  ( which leaves its fingerprints in everything ,  alas )  and the almost constant profanity ,  this can be a pretty fun time at the movies .  no ,  it ain't great .  yes ,  it could have been better .  but the makers ,  the actors ,  the crew ,  they all tried to make a good film  ( instead of a camp classic )  and that counts for a lot .  the line of campy zombie films is a mile long ,  and thank you ,  guys ,  for not adding to it .   kudos to the quiroz brothers .  i'd love to see what they do next .  and hey ,  somebody ,  give them a budget ! 
man ,  if anyone was expecting a great zombie movie after reading that title ,  then you are a retard and you deserve to be disappointed .  as for myself ,  i was expecting a low-budgeted cheeseball zombie flick- and that's exactly what i got .  i wasn't disappointed at all .  i thought it was a cool little movie .  the zombies were exactly as they should be ,  because all of the zombies had just been turned ,  so they are freshly-undead zombies .  obviously they did that because it would've been pretty costly if they had done full-on rotted zombie fx .  i understood the whole thing ,  i have no idea how anyone could seriously nitpick this movie .  it's called  " hood of the living dead "  for the love of god !  would you watch  " redneck zombies "  and any uwe boll movie and actually expect it to be great ?  of course not !  so why there are some morons on imdb whining like school girls about this movie ,  i'll never understand .  oh and yes ,  there are worse movies out there ,  so stop saying that this was the worst you've ever seen ,  'cause you know you're full of it !  you ever watch  " zombiez "  ?  ?  ?  ?  or  " feardotcom "  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  or  " house of the dead "  ?  ?  ?  ?  those are some of the worst i've ever seen .  if you can't see that it's just a low- budgeted zombie movie obviously made by zombie movie fans ,  then something's wrong with you .  i just had fun with it .  thumbs up from me and i'd also like to see a sequel . 
when i watch a low budget film i know what to expect .  i expect the acting not to be as good  ( budget reasons )  ,  i expect the lighting not to be as good  ( budget reasons ) i expect the sound not to be as good  ( budget again )  .  stop judging these low budget movies like a big budget film !  !  !  i'm a filmmaker myself so i understand the budget constraints on a low budget film .  stealing locations ,  shots etc .  .  .  the list goes on and on .  i don't want to say all the acting was bad .  jose rosete ,  chris angelo ,  victor zaragoza are good .  raul martinez is a natural .  not sold on carl washington yet .  he has to understand that every line is not important ,  some are throw away lines .  i say if a film makes you want to see what happens next ,  it's a good film .  i liked this movie .  i gave it an 8 .  i wanted to see what was gonna happen next .  great job quiroz brothers ! 
good times working with the quiroz brothers ,  and the entire cast on this project as the  " guy on the bench .  "  i was amazed how well they accomplished capturing all the identifiable traits of a true  " b "  horror film .  hopefully i will have the opportunity to work with pumpkin patch pictures team again in the future .  i moved to detroit shortly after completion and have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release .  one time was actually in the video store and the girl damn near lost her mind .  it was pretty funny and that was my 1st real autograph moment as i signed her receipt .  one day i asked the girl at blockbuster if the movie is rented often ,  and she confirmed by looking it up in the computer .  at the time it was renting more than ring2 which was also a new release at the time .  .  .  the title really captures immediate interest in the more urban markets .  she also noticed on many occasions the movie had not been returned by the customer leading me to believe the movie is just so good people don't want to give it back .  .  .  .  watch out for zombies when in the hood cause they will get ya !  jaysun barr  ( guy on the bench-2005 ) 
according to this board ,  i guess either you love it or hate it .  usually how it goes with all movies .  there is no need to get testy with others though .  all we are doing here is giving opinions .  i rented this movie last night and i want to come and throw my opinion in the mix .  i was surprised by how many people are thrashing it though .  there's a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan .  i'm a horror movie fan .  most plain olé' movie fans don't like horror movies .  so many low budget cam corder looking movies are coming out these days .  it's hard to keep up .  and what makes it tough to stay into these movies is how bad they are .  i wanted to come and write a review about  " hood of the living dead "  because it's pretty damn good compared to the rest of the junk out there .  it's nothing special but it's those horror film makers that try to be too serious that end up making a horrible horror film .  i really liked this one .  you telling me there is no effort in this one ?  and one more thing ,  i bet all of you have all of these huge dvd collections that you are so proud of ,  nothing but major motion pictures right ?  nothing wrong with that ,  but you have to know how to appreciate low-budget independent .  i knew what i was getting when i watched this movie .  i'm not going to be upset because i thought it was going to be some 100 million dollar movie .  some of you might need to stick with watching the matrix over and over again and stop trying to compare everything to the matrix .  and if most of you are under 24 ,  that explains everything .  good movie folks ,  check it out . 
hood of the living dead had a lot to live up to even before the opening credits began .  first ,  any play on  "  .  .  . of the living dead "  invokes his holiness mr .  romero and instantly sets up a high standard to which many movies cannot afford to aspire .  and second ,  my movie-watching companion professed doubt that any urban horror film would surpass the seminal leprechaun in the hood .  skeptical ,  we settled in to watch .    we were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good-hearted zombie film .  oh ,  certainly the budget is low ,  and of course the directors' amateurs friends populate the cast ,  but hood of the living dead loves zombie cinema .  cheap ?  yeah .  but when it's this cheap ,  you can clearly see where love holds it together .    ricky works in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night .  he dreams of moving out of oakland .  before this planned escape ,  however ,  his brother is shot to death in a drive-by .  ricky's keen scientific mind presents an option superior to cpr or 911 :  injections of his lab's experimental regenerative formula .  sadly ,  little bro wakes up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty oakland zombie !  chaos and mayhem !  i think it's more economical to eat your enemies than take vengeance in a drive-by ,  but then again ,  i'm a poor judge of the complexities of urban life .   ( how poor a judge ?  in response to a gory scene involving four men ,  i opined  " ah-ha !  white t-shirts on everyone so the blood shows up .  economical !  i used the same technique in my own low-budget horror film .  "  jordan replied ,   " no ,  that's gang dress .  white t-shirts were banned from new orleans bars for a time as a result .  "  oh .  )   a lot of the movie is set in someone's living room ,  so there's a great deal of hanging out and waiting for the zombies .  but the characters are sympathetic and the movie is sincere-- it surpasses its budget in spirit .    zombie explanation :  when man plays god ,  zombies arise !  or ,  perhaps :  follow fda-approved testing rules before human experimentation !    contribution to the zombie canon :  this is the first zombie movie i've seen with a drive-by shooting .  as far as the actual zombies go ,  infection is spread with a bite as usual ,  but quite unusually head shots don't work-- it's heart shots that kill .  zombies have pulses ,  the absence of which proves true death .  and these zombies make pretty cool jaguar-growl noises .    gratuitous zombie movie in-joke :  a mercenary named romero .  groan .    favorite zombie :  jaguar-noise little brother zombie ,  of course ! 
most of the bad reviews on this website blame  " hood of the living dead "  for one  ( or more )  of the following reasons :  1 )  it is a low-budget movie with virtually no acting ;  2 )  it was so bad it made me laugh 3 )  it is something i could do myself .  i won't even discuss the first point because it is a very subjective matter whether you like low-budget and independent stuff or not .  i must say ,  however ,  that i still fail to understand people renting such a movie as  " hood of the living dead "  and then looking surprised when they realize it is not as polished and cute as a romantic comedy with lindsay lohan or matthew mc conaughey .  as for the second point ,  i really don't see what's so wrong with laughing .  i personally like to laugh ,  and love movies that make me to ,  be they comedies or horror flicks .  when in  " hammerhead "  i saw this girl stepping into a puddle and the shark-man came out of it to eat her ,  i just cracked up .  and i was grateful that the director made such a stupid scene and gave me ten seconds of pure fun .  honestly ,  laughing just makes me feel good ,  while it seems that many people writing reviews see it as a bad bad thing .  if you only want to feel sad and scared while watching a movie ,   " hood of the living dead "  and low-budget flicks are definitely not for you .  but please don't come and tell us that you find them laughable .  we already know it .  this is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place .  however ,  it is the third point that leaves totally baffled .  just several years ago people were lining up out of theaters to see  " blair witch project "  ,  which is a way more rudimentary ,  boring ,  plot-less and bad-acted movie than  " hood of the living dead "   ( and takes itself way too seriously too )  .  moreover ,  half a million people go on youtube every day to see the short films of  " lonelygirl15 "  ,  which is certainly something everyone with a cute girlfriend ,  a room and a webcam could do !  not to talk about all of the even more amateurish videos you can find there .  why don't people blame those clips for bad acting and non-existing plot ?  i think it is one of the best things of our times that everyone ,  with affordable technology and a bunch of friends ,  can make their own movies and share them with people that have similar interests .  and i feel a certain admiration for people who spend their weekends with their friends making a honestly bad  ( yet refreshing )  piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the mall or playing video games alone .  leave aside your biases and your desire to sound like a smart film critic by attacking b-movies ,  and you'll see that  " hood of the living dead "  can bring you almost as much fun as it did to its makers !  if you have a taste for refreshing and enjoyable home-made horror movies ,  i recommend  " zombiez "  ,   " the ghosts of edendale "  ,   " the killer eye "  ,   " monster man "  ,   " don't look in the basement "  ,   " the worst horror movie ever made "  ,   " redneck zombies "  ,   " jesus christ vampyre-slayer "  and  " habit "  . 
i thought the movie  " i do they don't "  was fantastic .  in the past i've watched rob estes on  " suddenly susan "  &  " melrose place "  and also josie bissett on  " melrose place "  and loved seeing them together again in  " i do they don't "  .  they have great chemistry together  ( i guess being married in real life helps that !  )  - in the movie they are both widowed with children and careers and they fall in love and try blend their already busy chaotic families together without dropping the ball .  of course they stumble ,  but they keep it together which is what working and raising a family is all about .  so many people have been talking about this movie - all good !  - and the movie left us wanting more .  this would make a great series - appealing to many ages !  - it would be so nice to see a real life ,  down to earth ,  family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so called  " reality tv "  that all the stations are overwhelming us with these days .  someone tell the people at abc family they have the start of a new series here ! 
rob estes ,  josie bisset and a crap load of kids that look nothing like either of them .   basically ,  rob and josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night during a vegas vacation .  they each come home to find that their respective children already know of the nuptials due to tabloid-like not-so-fodder .  they ,  rob and josie ,  move both of them and their eight kids into one or the other's house .   rob builds furniture ,  i think ,  which is close enough to frank lambert's  ( patrick duffy )  construction job on the much similar step by step to warrant eternal mockage .   josie is some sort of cookie-making queen ,  though it doesn't look like she makes any of the cookies .  not close enough to carol foster's  ( suzanne somers ) hairdressing job to warrant likeness mockage ,  but hilariously preposterous enough to warrant atrocity mockage .   unlike step by step ,  they were a couple before the vacation and actually knew one another's last names ,  or so one assumes if their serious enough about a relationship to take a trip together .   anyhow ,  there are eight kids ;  moira ,  sandy ,  jeff ,  lily ,  daisy ,  nathan ,  andrew l .  and andrew b .  i ,  personally ,  think they should've just called the younger andrew 'andy' .   there's a lot of product placement ,  particularly for soup at hand  ( which is disgusting )  and listerine pocket packs .  there are also some stupid ,  senseless moments .  it's also not a great film to promote happy families .   but ,  hey !  rob estes !  this concludes my review of 'step by step .  .  .  on some really bad drugs . ' watch it for rob estes and his pretty ! eyes .  there are some great pretty ! eyes shots . 
how nice to have a movie the entire family can watch together .  josie bissett and rob estes  ( who are married in real life )  play a couple who marry in las vegas on a whim and then not only have to break the news to their kids but then have to try to meld their respective households  ( each has two boys and two girls ) into a cohesive family unit .  what transpires when the group ,  which includes four teenagers ,  two preteens and two younger children ,  makes one wonder at first if there can ever be true happiness for carrie and jim .  the fights between the kids  ( and one little love affair between two of them )  make one wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along .  more interesting than the brady bunch ,  what this is a totally enjoyable way to spend a couple hours .  recommended as a feel good movie for all ages . 
i really truly enjoyed this movie .   ( which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site !  )  i am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold ,  snowy saturday night .  it is funny ,  poignant ,  and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others !   ( fess up ladies ,  we have all been there !  )  bill paterson shines as the reverand gerald marsden and andie mcdowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it .   ( and truly ,  there is the best  " wedding escape "  that i have ever seen or dreamed up in this film  .  .  .  more guts than anyone i have ever known !  )  you will laugh and you will cry --- ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing  .  .  .  .  it is a hidden gem that should have done tonnes of box office .   ( now i have to look around to purchase a copy !  ) 
eye in the labyrinth is not your average giallo .  .  . and to be honest ,  i'm not really sure that it really is a giallo ;  but giallo or not ,  despite some problems ,  this is certainly a very interesting little film .  i'm hesitant to call it a giallo because the film doesn't feature most of the things that make these films what they are ;  but many genre entries break the mould ,  and this would seem to be one of them .  the film doesn't feature any brutal murders as many giallo's do ,  but this is made up for with a surreal atmosphere and a plot just about confusing enough to remain interesting for the duration .  the plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by julie ,  his patient who ,  for some reason ,  she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her .  we then relocate to a big house lived in by a number of people ,  but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before julie's arrival .  .  .   the film seems to be professing something about how the mind is like a labyrinth .  this never really comes off ,  and i preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point  ( if any )  the film is trying to make .  eye in the labyrinth is directed by mario caiano ,  the director behind the excellent night of the doomed some years earlier .  he doesn't create the atmosphere as well in this film as he did in the earlier one ;  but the surreal aspects of the story come off well ,  and the mystery is always kept up which stops the film from becoming boring .  the film stars rosemary dexter ,  who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance .  most of the rest of the cast aren't really worth mentioning ,  with the exceptions of adolfo celi ,  who is good as the villain of the piece and alida valli ,  whom cult fans will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flicks .  the film does explain itself at the end ;  which is lucky as i'm sure i'm not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then !  overall ,  this may not be classic stuff ;  but its good enough and worth seeing . 
this little seen movie is a languid and laid-back giallo .  it veers away from some of the cliché's of the genre and adopts a looser approach .  it's about a woman searching for her missing lover ;  a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason .  her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals .  in true giallo style ,  murder is never far away .   the cast is really rather good .  we have aldofo celi  ( thunderball )  ,  alida valli  ( suspiria )  ,  horst frank  ( cat o' nine tails )  and a very young sybil danning  ( 80's scream queen )  .  the lead actress is rosemary dexter ,  and while i am not familiar with her ,  she does a good job in leading the picture .   one of the defining features of eye in the labyrinth is its music .  atypically for a giallo it features a jazz-rock fusion soundtrack .  this score ,  composed by roberto nicolosi ,  is reminiscent of miles davis ,  especially his work on in a silent way .  it's an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most gialli .  the fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny ,  sea-front scenery that the film is mostly made up of .   this is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder set-pieces .  well ,  this film falls a little short in this regard .  it's certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between .  the opening dream-murder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence .  but this really isn't a particularly violent film .  still ,  i don't think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre .  the mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters  ( the idiot boy saro and that unsettlingly inappropriate dubbed accent ?  )  and moments of the bizarre to satisfy ;  while the sleaze-factor is upheld with a smattering of nudity throughout .   eye in the labyrinth plays like a giallo version of an agatha christie mystery ,  as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa ,  all under suspicion of murder ;  we have the obligatory flashbacks detailing their connections with the final hours of the  ( highly unsympathetic )  murder victim .  while this isn't a grade-a example of the genre ,  it's certainly an appealingly different one ,  as it doesn't borrow too heavily from other films of the sub-genre .  for giallo enthusiasts i give this a thumbs up and hope one day it's given a nice dvd transfer .  it certainly deserves the treatment . 
giallo fans ,  seek out this rare film .  it is well written ,  and full of all sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films .  i don't want to give anything away ,  so i wont even say anything about the plot .  the whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere ,  and you don't know what to expect or who to suspect .  recommended !  the only place i've seen to get this film in english is from european trash cinema ,  for $15 . 
i love this tv series so much .  it contains animation that is interesting and beautiful .  i cant believe that they cut it off tv ,  and also that i never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not ,  apparently they survive ,  but i'm not sure .  cybersix was by far the best tv show ever .  i know its to late to hope they will start the series over again so i'm really glad i got to watch it .  i luved it so much <3   its about a women by the name of cybersix ,  she is not human .  she goes by adrian sieldman ,  a man teacher at a highschool .  now cybersix is actually a women ,  she is just disguised as a man in the day .  by night cybersix patrols the city .   a guy by the name of von reichter is the one who created cybersix ,  and once he finds put she is alive he uses everything he can to capture her .   if u have never watched it before u should totally download it .  it was the best tv show in the world .  why did they cut it off ?  ?  ?  ?  some people have issues .  but i'm glad i got to watch the 13 episodes . 
have you ever ,  or do you have ,  a pet who's been with you through thick and thin ,  who you'd be lost without ,  and who you love no matter what ?  betcha never thought they feel the same way about you !   wonderful ,  wonderful family film .  if you have a soft spot for animals ,  this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter your age .  i used to watch this movie all the time when i was a little kid ,  and i find that now ,  at age sixteen ,  i love it as much as i did then .  i could never decide on a favorite character then ,  and i still don't think i can !  i love all three of the animals .  the dialogue seems very real and comfortable ,  like a loving ,  but feuding family .  i do love chance ,  and how at the end he says that he has a family at last .  cheesy ,  yes ,  but one must remember that this is meant to be a family film ,  and it fulfills that role perfectly .  sassy has just the perfect dose of  " sassiness "  and shadow is the perfect leader/role model to the young ,  adventurous chance .   the animals way outshine the humans ,  but of course most of the teary moments are to be had during an interaction with them  ( ie .  rescuing molly ,  and the end )  .  not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives each moment even more emotion ,  and an accompanying heart-swelling feeling .  i give this 9/10 .  to be compared to  ( and even rated better than )  cats and dogs and babe . 
i am a fan of animal movies .  if you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over .  homeward bound did just this .  they took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it .  it was a complete success .  it is very much an archetypal movie .  you have the obi-wan of the group ( shadow )  who is wise and logical ,  you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting chance ,  and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised .  these three personalities bounce off of each other very well .  i also like how they made chance and sassy such dynamic characters ,  and they did not overdue it .  most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film .  what they are forgetting ,  however ,  is that it is supposed to be a kids film ,  and this still does not take away from the acual movie .  this is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie .  it is a disney movie without the cartoons ,  an air bud movie with a better plot .  i would ,  without a doubt ,  advise you to watch it . 
this movie is a true masterpiece ,  it really is .  it's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick ,  full of fun ,  laughter ,  heartbreak ,  and with a little drama to keep you on your toes .    a true family film ,  homeward bound tells the story of three brave pets ,  who set out to cross the rocky mountains in an attempt to find their owners ,  following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way .  one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the voice acting is that good .  shadow is a wonderful character ,  old ,  wise and brave ,  and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment .  chance - who wouldn't love a dog like chance ?  he's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen .  and sassy is very witty for a cat - she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper ;  'here kitty kitty kitty .  .  .  not on your life ,  chubby . '   there were also lots of well made emotional scenes ,  such as sassy going over the waterfall  ( i was truly scared for her )  ,  shadow falling in the ditch  ( almost in tears )  and then the fantastic ending ,  when all three pets return home .  .  .  including good old shadow !    a favourite for all time - anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals .  rent it or buy it now ,  and it'll leave you with happy memories that'll last a lifetime . 
i watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re-sight all of the dialogue .  and when i watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh .  i think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film .  however watching it now i can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was .  but i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on vhs on my fist tv that would cloud the image in yellow .  and and bearing in mind it is a children's film ,  that is why i would still definitely give it 10/10 . 
i haven't seen the original  " incredible journey "  since i was a child ,  so i can't really compare the two versions .  this version tells the story of three animals ,  two dogs and a cat ,  whose owners leave them with friends in the countryside when the father of the family has to take a new job in san francisco .  the pets ,  believing that they have been abandoned ,  escape and set out on a long homeward journey through wilderness .   this story might have been most easily filmed as a cartoon ,  but both versions are in fact live-action films made using real animals .  one major difference is that in the later version the animals speak in human voices ,  giving each its own distinct personality ,  something that was not done in the original film .   ( a similar device of talking animals has been used in other recent children's films such as  " racing stripes "  )  .  some critics have been rather sniffy about the use of this device ,  but my own view is that giving the animals distinctive personalities of their own helps to strengthen the film rather than weaken it .  the animals were voiced by big-name stars ,  don ameche ,  michael j .  fox and sally fields .   both dogs are male ,  and their relationship parallels that between many humans in  " buddy-buddy "  movies .  shadow ,  a golden retriever ,  is the wise ,  experienced older dog ;  chance the younger one is brash ,  cocky and impulsive .  to british eyes chance looks like a boxer ,  but is actually an american bulldog ,  which is apparently a different breed to its british cousin .  sassy the cat is female with a rather prim and proper personality .  she is very proud of her status as a cat ,  which in her eyes makes her vastly superior to any mere dog .   (  " cats rule ,  dogs drool !  "  )  .   from an adult viewpoint the film has a number of faults ;  it can be sentimental ,  some of the incidents  ( such as the one in which the animals manage to catapult a mountain lion into the river )  are quite incredible ,  and the human characters are all completely forgettable .  this ,  however ,  is a film which is mainly aimed at children ,  and i suspect they will enjoy it immensely .  certainly ,  any animal-loving child will do so .   ( comments by some professional critics such as james berardinelli ,  who complained that the animals' voices lessened the film's  " grandeur "  ,  only serve to strengthen my view that professional critics are not always the best guides to children's movies .  i doubt if many playground conversations about  " homeward bound "  concentrated on its supposed grandeur )  .   one thing adults will appreciate is the photography of california's sierra nevada mountains .  they may also appreciate the film's blend of humour and excitement as the runaway pets encounter perils such as bears ,  mountain lions and porcupines in the wilderness .  this is a very enjoyable family film .  7/10
i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film .  i thought it was funny ,  sexy ,  painful ,  and warm .  andie macdowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable .  for once ,  the director of a macdowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film .  the romance between kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well .  her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life .  imelda stalinson ,  who has been a mvp in so many british films ,  does a great job in this .  there is some tragedy in this but i think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting ,  clean direction ,  and witty writing . the film quality is excellent and the music is good ,  too ,  though unavailable on sound track . 
spoilers alert  homeward bound :  the incredible journey is an important film from my life because it's the first film i remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4-year old scamp .  the story is based on the sheila burnford novel ,  and is a reason why it's not possible to write this one off as a brainless lassie clone .   the basic story :  two dogs and a cat happily live in the seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children ,  gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner san francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months .  the bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong ,  and shadow the golden retriever and sassy the himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are ,  though the young and happy-go-lucky american bulldog known as chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical  ( due in part to his voice-over explaining his being abandoned as a pup ,  picked up to an animal shelter ,  and being bought by the family )  ,  though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling .   the three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness  ( fantastic wilderness settings by the way )  ,  driven on by shadow's instincts of direction .  they meet several perils along the way ,  hoping to make it home ,  while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance .  there are funny moments all the way through ,  great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines  ( see - memorable quotes )  ,  and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling ,  punctuated by moments of sadness  ( such as when sassy's arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall ,  leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers )  .   somehow though ,  i fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take .  somehow ,  it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story .   the ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg ,  finds it hard to get out and gives up ,  exhausted ,  followed by chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out ,  telling him how important he is to him and how he's pushed them this far so he shouldn't throw it all away so easily .    the way that this scene  ( brilliantly done )  isn't concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when chance and sassy return home ,  but shadow is nowhere to be seen .  then just as all seems lost ,  he slowly appears ,  and is reunited with the family .  chance's conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey ,  and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there ,  leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown ,  but also how the other two have as well .  hang on a second ,  i think i'm going to cry .  .  .   anyway ,  i haven't read sheila burnford's book ,  so i don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie .  but this is a film that all the family can watch ,  and while the tots will love the talking animals ,  older viewers will understand the plot line better  ( as i found when i watched the film again after several years without seeing it )  .  this film is a masterpiece in cinema ,  and i suggest that if you haven't seen it you go out and get it !   and please avoid the sequel  ( see my review for homeward bound ii !  ) 
first of all ,  i loved bruce broughton's music score ,  very lyrical ,  and this alone added to the film's charm .  the best aspect of the movie were the three animals ,  superlatively voiced by michael j . fox ,  sally field and the late don ameche .  whereas fox has the funniest lines ,  ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character ( the voice of reason )  ,  and field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling chance off .  the humans weren't as engaging ,  and sometimes the film dragged ,  but that is my only complaint .  this is one beautiful-looking film ,  with beautiful close up shots of canada ,  i believe .  although the film itself is quite long ,  there is never a seriously dull moment ,  and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script .  all in all ,  a charming and perhaps underrated film ,  with a 9/10 from me .  bethany cox . 
this is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy .  it's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals don't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own .  the cat is named sassy and she lives up to her name .  chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound .  shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things .  put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time .  there are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all .  it's the best talking animal movie that i've seen so far .  it's a really good movie for families . 
this is one of my favorite family movies .  loved it when i was little and it still holds up with me now that i'm older .  i still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times .  i never have much cared for animals talking ,  or at least un-animated ones but this one i'll stand up for .  it's a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart .   there aren't any other live animal movies that i can think of at the moment that i even could compare with ,  let alone like as much as this one .  i might be giving too much praise to this movie but i don't think show .  i really holds that great message that "  home is where the heart is .  "  or at least that's the message i gained from it .  definitely recommended for a good old family movie night . 
this is a story of two dogs and a cat looking for their way back home . old and wise golden retriever shadow ,  young american bulldog chance and himalayan cat sassy flee from the ranch and go into the wilderness to be reunited with their family . homeward bound :  the incredible journey  ( 1993 )  is a family adventure directed by duwayne dunham . it's a remake of a 1963 film . this movie got a sequel three years later . michael j .  fox is the perfect man to do the voice-over for chance . fox has some youthful energy he brings to the role . sally field does great voice work as sassy . don ameche is fantastic as shadow . this was this veteran actor's second last movie . also the visible actors are great . kim greist plays laura burnford-seaver . robert hays is bob seaver . benji thall plays peter burnford . veronica lauren is hope burnford . kevin chevalia is jamie seaver . jean smart portrays kate . it's quite amazing to watch these pets trying to survive in the wilderness . we see sassy taken by the river and she seems like a goner . the bear scene is exiting and funny . chance has no chance with that big ,  hungry bear . and his meeting with the porcupine looks painful . this is some great fun for the whole family . 
great voices ,  lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie .  the addition of  " character "  to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning ,  particularly the relationship between the older fellow ,  shadow ,  and the young hellraiser ,  chance .  the earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive ,  which is done perfectly here .  sally field is lovable in anything ,  but really shines in this film as the proud feline ,  sassy .  great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life ,  and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent .  there's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery .  definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids .  hats off to disney . 
this is one of the greatest child-pet movies ever created .  i cry every time i see shadow yelling  " wait ,  wait for me peter !  "  as the family car is pulling away .  this is a must see if you love animals !  best movie ever !  the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid .  like when sassy says to chance ;   " cat's rule and dogs drool !  "  lines like this i could do without ,  but when i was six i bet i loved that line .  the storyline may seem hooky to some ,  but i like it .  shadow as the older dog who's preparing chance to take over for him when he's gone is really moving when you think about it .  it reminded me of my childhood dog .  i think everyone can find a piece of themselves in  " homeward bound .  " 
this is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what they're thoughts are .  i don't know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit .  it also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilities . put humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out .  for once an original film is improved by a remake as the voice-over for the first has been removed .  only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into murder , proving that , after all , animals are more interesting than people
hey guys ,    i have been looking every where to find these two movies and i can't find them anywhere in my local area .   ( i am australian )  .  could you please help me and tell me where i can buy it from .  in general home ward bound 1 and 2 are the best movies i have ever seen and are good for people of all ages .  it was my favourite movie wen i was 5 and it still is even now when i am a teenager .  it is a great movie for the whole family .  my entire family loves this movie except for my younger sister because i have watched it that many times that she is sick of it .  i love this movie and i cant wait till i can buy it again on dvd .   sally
i really liked the film . at ending i was in tears . this film is incredible . go watch the movie .  you will enjoy it . i could have given it ranking more than 10 . i liked the teasing between chance and sassy . i like the leadership of shadow . overall this movie was perfect .   its sequel is good but not good as this movie . i think there should be a third sequel to it . not only this film attracts children but also adults . my whole family enjoyed this film . chance was full of humor . sassy is an intelligent cat .   again i say this movie is a must watch . the more u see this movie the more you are attached with this movie . this movie is a classic . 
too bad a couple of comments before me don't know the facts of this case .  it is based on actual events ,  a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington ,  de/philadelphia pa region from '96 through 2000 .  i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period .  of course i immediately pointed out that the actress  ( who i really like in cold case )  who played fahey looked nothing like her  ( anne marie was actually prettier )  .  i have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capano's and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period .  details of the case were right on .  .  . no deviations of dramatic effect .  .  . even down to the carpet ,  gun ,  furniture ,  and cooler .  in conclusion ,  i also wanted to add that i have met tom carper many times at various functions  ( a good man ,  despite being a politician )  and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime .  guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars . 
this is a really cool movie !  i remember first seeing it when i was really young and i used to watch it all the time like once a week .  .  . shadow was my favorite character in the movie .  homeward bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things .  parts of the movie are sad though  ( such as when sassy ,  the cat ,  falls down the waterfall ,  and when shadow falls in the hole at the end .  )  i have seen the second homeward bound but i gotta say its not as good as the first .  shadow is the smart one ,  sassy is ,  well ,  sassy ,  and chance is the funny idiot .  i recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies ,  or talking animals .  this is one of my top ten favorite movies ! 
there have been countless talking-animal films in the past ,  the majority of which either feature animals' mouths digitally animated to nearly match the voice acting ,  or are ridiculously amateur .  'homeward bound :  the incredible journey' is neither .   this film doesn't need the infant-pleasing addition of moving canine lips ,  or gesturing feline limbs .  it has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to one another ,  and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart  ( as all great boy-and-and-his-dog films should )  .   homeward bound is the epitome of all family-friendly animal romps to me ,  and boasts some beautiful cinematography ,  an inspiring soundtrack  ( from the genius of bruce broughton )  ,  and an impressive cast .  .  .   michael j .  fox  .  .  .  chance  sally field  .  .  .  sassy  don ameche  .  .  .  shadow  frank welker  ( voice god )   .  .  .  various  it is a modernised version of the children's classic work of fiction 'the incredible journey' ,  which was made into a semi-documentary film by disney long long ago in 1963 .  the sequel  ( lost in san fransisco )  isn't nearly as good a film ,  but extends the adventure of my favourite furry-footed friends ,  and is a fun urban-twist on the grand-outdoor-adventure theme .  want to entertain your children with a witty ,  pretty ,  heart-warming mini-epic ,  without the idiotic and often utterly ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema ?  parents ,  buy all three films for your children - now !  thank you ,  disney ,  for bringing a tear to my eyes with each time i watch this early-90s classic ! 
 " homeward bound :  the incredible journey "  is one of those wonderful old movies about house pets .  deserves a place among the great movies of its genre and even the cinema world in general ,  together with other animal movies like  " old yeller "  ,   " napoleon "  ,   " fluke "  and  " air bud "  .  this means it is more than just a movie about pets .   can this possibly be just a  " remake "  ?  it is too good to be a  " remake "  !  i know this one by heart ,  since my early teen years  ( when i was 12 )  .   it's a family movie to treasure .  it's emotional ,  thrilling ,  adventurous ,  exciting ,  entertaining ,  humorous ,  charming ,  sweet ,  nostalgic ,  beautiful ,  heartwarming and sometimes dramatic .  it's one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films .   this movie does not lack qualities .  it has a well thought story ,  enjoyable characters ,  excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack ,  dazzling sceneries/landscapes of the magnificent sierra mountains  ( in oregon )  .  speaking of the vistas ,  it's not all mountains :  forests ,  trees ,  rivers ,  waterfalls ,  sunsets .  .  .  in conclusion ,  all of pure nature's wonders - truly a full panorama .    the main human characters are nice ,  well developed and well portrayed by respective actors .  robert hays is awesome as the kind-hearted dad ,  bob seaver .  kim greist is good as laura burnford .  veronica lauren is equally good as hope .  kevin chevalia is conventional as the youngest and cute brother jamie  ( his appearance actually reminds me very much of kevin corcoran in  " old yeller "  )  .  benj thall is great as peter burnford .   when it comes to our quadruped pals ,  shadow is my favorite .  shadow is the loyal ,  wise ,  mature ,  beautiful ,  caring and loving old golden retriever  ( brilliantly voiced by don ameche )  .  chance ,  the american bulldog ,  is the opposite of shadow .  he is carefree ,  silly ,  impatient ,  anxious ,  clumsy ,  hilarious and loves to play  ( voiced by the talented michael j .  fox )  .  chance just can't stand still .  sassy is the epitome of cats's image :  elegant ,  independent ,  very confident and self-proud ,  with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm .  sassy is a seal point himalayan cat ,  one of the most beautiful cat breeds .  sassy is voiced by sally field ,  who also does a good job .   our four-legged friends are ,  themselves ,  great  " actors "  by nature :  ben as shadow ,  rattler as chance and tiki as sassy .   it's an underrated movie ,  but a classic by its own right .  its sequel is clearly inferior .   this should definitely be on top 250 . 
very few so called  " remakes "  can be as good as the originals .  this one crosses that border with flying colors .  just a remake ,  i don't think so !  i saw it theatrically at the age of nine ,  and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film .    the film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart .  the earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie ,  but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film .  this update is more epic and cinematic .  still ,  i thoroughly recommend both films .   this film is certainly a must-see for an animal lover .  we have the wise old golden retriever ,  shadow ;  the sharp ,  sarcastic himalayan cat ,  sassy ;  and the young ,  fun-loving american bulldog ,  chance .  the animals are brilliantly voiced by don ameche ,  sally field ,  and michael j .  fox ,  respectively .   there is virtually nothing offensive in the film .  there is a bit of scatological humor ,  but nothing extreme .  no hard violence ,  save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall ,  an angry porcupine ,  and a dark railroad shaft .   hilarious ,  scary ,  moving ,  and above all real ,  it surprised me to see that this film didn't win any awards ,  not one .  nevertheless ,  i will have to say this is just as good as some of the best picture nominees nowadays . 
i've seen this about 2 or 3 times and haven't regretted it .  homeward bound is not just a typical animal movie .  its unique ,  fun and bursting with adventure .  the things that make it a fun movie are the animals  ( obvious ) who are wonderfully trained .  a very good effort .   8 . 5/10 ! 
it surprises me how much i love this movie despite the fact that i don't really like dogs .  fox ,  field ,  and ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of chance ,  sassy and shadow ,  and the acting by the animals themselves is just amazing .   i have seen this movie 72 times already  ( i know that sounds scary ,  but it's true !  )  ,  and every time the ending scenes still get me .  i highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers .  it is indeed my all-time favorite movie ! 
this movie was awesome .  .  . it made me laugh ,  it make a bawl ,  and most of all it has talking animals in it !  !  this movie should be seen by all kinds of people !  it is one of my favorite movies ,  and i just love it so much that i just had to comment on it !  !  ! it rox !  it is so heart felt and a wonderful storyline that makes up a great and heartfelt movie ! my favorite character is shadow .  this is because i think that he is the most interesting and charming .  i used to have a golden retriever just like shadow ,  i miss him so much !  !  !  he was my best friend and i knew that when he died ,  he would be in a happier place ,  but i miss him with all of my heart !  !  this movie is the best i love it and everyone should !  love your pets no matter what they do ,  cherish them forever !  !  ! 
as a kid i thought this movie was great .  it had animals ,  it had beautiful music ,  and it had my favorite actor :  michael j .  fox .  now ,  i still love this movie ,  for different reasons .  it has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera .  it has beautiful ,  well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly ,  with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme ,  that still makes me cry .  even when people hum it .  and it has my favorite actor ,  michael j .  fox .    based on a book ,  this is the story of three house pets ,  an intelligent ,  overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of shadow ,  a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog ,  chance .  the three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away .  dismayed and worried ,  the pets break out and plan a trip across the sierra mountains for the trip of their lives .  a truly incredible journey .  so what ,  maybe home is just over that mountain .  but what if it isn't ?    i suggest homeward bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters ,  and for anyone else that  .  .  .  yeah ,  everyone go watch it . 
this is definitely one of the greatest disney movies ever made .  it's a real pleaser to anyone .  it'll make you laugh ,  it'll make you cry ,  and it'll put you into suspense .   basically ,  what homeward bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation .  they don't know what is going on ,  and desperately wanting to go home ,  they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness .   this is one of the last movies that don ameche starred in .  he provided the voice of shadow ,  the old ,  wise and friendly golden retriever .  also starring in this movie was sally field providing the voice of sassy ,  the himalayan cat .  but seriously ,  what this movie is all about is chance !  voiced by michael j .  fox  ( my all-time favorite actor )  ,  chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog ,  lovable ,  playful ,  energetic and goofy ,  and every time i crack up when watching this movie ,  it's because of chance ;  it's like the comedy never ends !    this movie is also very sad at times .  it sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets .   one scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound ;  i especially feel shocked at the part where chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it .  the movie had other suspenseful moments ,  but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one .   overall ,  it's a wonderful family movie .  if you enjoyed this movie ,  you'll probably enjoy the sequel too .  i give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 ! 
i first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special .  as time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film ,  which i will come to later .  for a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while .  when looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago  ( now being 15 )  ,  i dug out the vhs of homeward bound .  after watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain .  the film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect .  the films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground ,  something that you all need .  the way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic .  in that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever ,  looking after or guiding 'chance' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young american bulldog ,  with sassy the clever ,  vulnerable but confident cat .  the film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen .    i don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite ,  but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return ,  when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy ,  painfully are told by him to leave .  when both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all .  there is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15 .  this film may not be lord of the rings but for disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10/10 . 
thomas capano was not anne marie's boss tom carper ,  the governor was .  that is the reason the feds became involved ,  he called clinton and asked him to get the feds involved in the case .  i lived outside of philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day .  i also read ann rule's book and saw the  " city confidential "  segment on a&e .  tom capano was a megalomanic ( sp .  )  ,  an uber-controller and a monster .  he claimed to love ann marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control .  when she wouldn't let him do that anymore he killed her ,  the ultimate form of control .  i think it's a waste of money that he is still alive . 
homeward bound is a beautiful film .  y'know the part where shadow falls down the ditch .  .  .  thingy ,  i *cried* ,  considering i was only six ,  i cried !  it takes a lot to make me cry !  the dogs and the cat are excellently trained .  a nice family movie ,  *not* for completely hardened non-fluffy people or animal-haters but could for soft-as-crap a . k . a .  people like me .   a good film overall ,  10/10 ! 
this movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites .  the voices for the animals are wonderful .  sally field and michael j .  fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch ,  but the real standout is don ameche as the old ,  faithful golden retriever .  this movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults .  humorous and suspenseful ,  and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry !   ( happy tears !  ) 
this is a great movie for all ages .  its the story about three animals how have to find their way home .  there is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie .  you never know what is going to happen next .  this movie makes you cry and makes you laugh .  you just don't know what going to happen next .  the trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes .  they producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too .  the animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors/actress themselves .  everything about this movie is great !  10 out of 10 the whole way !  rent or buy it today i can guarantee you will love it the whole family will ! 
i watch this movie all the time .  i've watched it with family ages 3 to 87 ,  and everyone in between ;  they all loved it .  it really shows the true scenes a dog has ,  and the love and loyalty you get from a pet .  just beautiful .   it's great for thoes who love comedy movies ,  the tear-jerker movies ,  or even just pets .   the music is wonderful ,  the animals spectacular ,  the scenes truly thought out ,  and the characters perfect .  what i liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities :  shadow  ( the oldest ,  a golden retriever )  he's the wise one ,  filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog ,  chance  ( the american bulldog puppy )  is basically a puppy with a witty side ,  the comical character ;  and sassy  ( the hymilayan cat )  she's the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner ,  the real girly one . 
maybe i'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever !  i saw it for the first time when i was around 4 or 5 ,  and i cried my eyes out .  between then and now  ( embarrassed at age 15 )  i have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them .  don't worry they're tears of happiness !  and it's not all sap !  there's a lot of humor and comedy in it too .  usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case .  my only word of advice :  even if you love this-don't see the sequal .  .  . cornyness !  i suggest everyone checks this out .  .  . you won't be sorry ,  no matter how old or young you are ! 
i found this film to be the usual french slap in america's face .  the camera ,  all too often ,  focuses on fat people ,  on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas .  while the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer ,  the cinematography exploits and demeans them .  there were ,  undoubtedly ,  thin people to be seen in glencoe and neat ,  organized homes ,  but malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen .    i can only hope that some american filmmakers will go to france to reveal to the american public its worst elements .  i can assure you ,  as a frequent visitor to france ,  that all is not well there .  foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated ,  thus creating severe social inequities .  but americans are not eager to unmask the french for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the u . s .  ,  so we're not likely to see films on the subject . 
i just love malle's documentaries .  they are so effortless and simple but still so fascinating .  i have no idea why this documentary works .  it is about glencoe ,  minnesota .  5000 people live there and nothing happens ,  really .  but still malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting .  his love for humanity ,  even racist or homophobic people ,  is so overwhelming that you just can't help but also to fall in love with them too .    malle filmed most of it in 1979 .  he came back 6 years later to see what had changed .  this would have been a good film without the material 6 years later but this small addition makes it great .  it may sound like malle was just doing what has been done in the up series but in fact it is not .  the up series are about people .  malle's emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person but what has happened to this community .  and the change is great .  1985 is the reagan era and the farmers are suffering .  once a proud community ,  now no one sees much future at all and parents hope their children will educate them self and do something else than farming .    this documentary is quite relevant today .  our financial crises today started because of what was happening then .  just take a look to these final words in the film ,  spoken by an older lawyer from the town  ( in 1985 )  :    " well i have high hopes for this country because the things that are going on right now can only be characterized in my mind as an obsession with greed .  and a nation doesn't live long with that obsession .  and particularly a democracy that .  .  .  there's good - there's good - a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they aren't gonna - they aren't gonna subscribe to this philosophy of greed that's going on now .  it's horrible .  "   unfortunately it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened . 
revenge is the theme of this denzel washington thriller that offers its share of action ,  mayhem ,  murder and grisly bloodletting .  the essentials are a bodyguard's search and destroy mission as his charge ,  young dakota fanning ,  is kidnapped from school ,  which is exactly what washington was hired to prevent .  the mexico city locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable ,  violent conclusion ,  with plot twists along the way .  washington ,  a former cia operative with a drinking problem ,  gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the plot's outline .  washington and fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a troublesome beginning ,  the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends .  christopher walken ,  rachel ticotin ,  radha mitchell ,  giancarlo giannini and mickey rourke comprise the good cast in support of the two stars . 
basically ,  the movie might be one of the most mesmerizing titles made by either of the two scotts ( ridley and tony )  .  let's make it straight ,  the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actioner/thriller ever made .   when it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes ,  denzel washington and tony scotts really make a perfect duo .  both this movie and deja vu are better thrillers you can expect .  washington really got very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every executing scenes in the movie .  one would easily be related to his character's emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road .  it's a success that they created a super-dark mexico city with a lot of shits happening .  one would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in man on fire .  i don't know what would the mexicans think when they watch this .  .  .  .  .  .   well ,  let's face it again .  it's among the best of the death wish genre ,  but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence .  it's a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let denzel washington play the  " missing sheep "  type of tragic hero .  in the end ,  they even had the kidnapper shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary .  i was checking on imdb if the movie was based on real events for that .  .  .  .  .  .  so that's for your consideration if you also finds the movie's theme is a little bit phony .   at the end ,  i hope one would not take this movie for real .   8/10 for art direction/editing/cinematographic/denzel washington . 
this film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion .  sorrow ,  love ,  laughter  ,  anger .  there are so many emotions thrown into this film .  from start to finish this film is immensely captivating .  the plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown in the faces of the audiences but don't be mistaken ,  this film is powerful .  washington as always puts on a great performance .   the plot in a nutshell :  man suffers from depression ,  a young girl brings life into him ,  kids gets kidnap ,  man wants revenge .  doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there .  for instant ,  taken is a similar film but when you compare them both ,  man on fire wins hands down .  the characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great .  mexico city feels alive  ,  it looks like mexico city ,  it smells like mexico city .  everything is portrayed brilliantly  .  the style of direction was something i enjoyed and brought the best out of mexico city  this is one of those films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch .  from start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist ,  making it a roller-coaster journey .  there enough action to keep you happy ,  there enough character development to please you and then there's washington to bring a smile to your face  .  watch this film ,  you won't be disappointed
to those who have not followed the anne marie fahey murder case .  you are missing out one of the saddest yet complicated murder of all .  the murderer is popular delaware attorney ,  tom capano and the victim is the delaware governor's scheduling secretary ,  anne marie fahey .  their relationship was a well-kept secret until her disappearance and murder .  she wanted to leave him but he just wouldn't let her go so easily .  on the other hand ,  he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters .  where did he find the time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life ?  besides ,  the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four hour mini series .  while the actress who plays ms .  fahey does a fine job ,  she does not have her dark long hair .  his other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman .  mark harmon is better looking and does an emmy award winning performance as tom capano .  it would be better with actual delaware and philadelphia locations .  with ann rule's executive producing ,  she adds accuracy to anne marie's characteristic of organization and her personal battle with an eating disorder .  these bits of information might be overlooked by any other executive producer or director .  if you have not read the book ,  it is well worth it .  ann rule is a fascinating storyteller of true crime .  it is ironic that mark harmon plays tom capano .  he also played ann rule's former friend and subject ,  ted bundy in an another book adaptation many years ago .  he was brilliant then and now .  he does an above average job with an amazing story .  even president clinton offered his assistance in the anne marie fahey case .  and now ,  the former governor tom carper is now the united states senator for delaware who defeated longtime ,  popular incumbent senator richard roth in the november 2000 election .  if you don't think the movie is interesting ,  then the read rule's book . 
tony scott can make good films and bad ,  personally i think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother ,  but this is quite possibly his best film .   what makes this film so great is that scott gives denzel  ( on scorching form ,  better than training day )  and the revelation who is dakota fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness .  the set up is absolutely not boring ,  although it takes time - it is involving ,  and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for radha mitchell as the mother .  this all serves to make the action so much more effective ,  as we are so invested in the characters ,  for all their all too obvious weaknesses .  this film has you on the edge for its entirety ,  and doesn't cop out at the end either .   the film would of course be nothing without washington .  i often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles ,  when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there  ( i can only really think of one ,  daniel day lewis ,  who has more on-screen power these days )  .  this film should have been huge ,  given his status and the strength of his performance ,  and the quality of the film .  it just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the hilt ,  it ends up going straight to video .  i wish i'd got the chance to see this on the big screen . 
man on fire tells a story of an ex-special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom .  at first he's not to friendly ,  but then they befriend with each other ,  he decides to stop drinking etc .  ,  etc .  .  .  then one day she gets kidnapped .  .  .  and killed .  .  .   and he ,  won't stop at anything to get the revenge .   that's basically the story of man on fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry .   that's also because of the great music harry-gregson williams with lisa gerrard  ( gladiator )  composed .   but the strongest part of the movie .  .  .  wait .  .  .  the thing is ,  everything here is perfect .   first - acting .  denzel washington is at his best ,  mickey rourke and christopher walken good as always ,  great radtha mitchell and amazing young dakota fanning .  and that's not the end of the list .  .  .   then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing ,  should have won an oscar for sure .   the story is .  .  .  not just a revenge movie .  the story is intelligent ,  the story makes you think .  .  .  and is pure beautiful .  really .   this is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime ,  at least once ! 
this excellent drama had me in suspense the whole time .  i could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder .  this movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be .  i really did cry in the end  ( which i don't want to give away !  )  it also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it comes to murder .    the cast was also very good .  the only bad cast member was the actress who played anne marie .  the actress did a great job ,  but the director didn't .  i say this because he found someone who didn't look a single bit like anne marie fahey herself . 
in mexico city ,  the former cia assassin and presently an alcoholic decadent man john creasy  ( denzel washington )  is hired by the industrialist samuel ramos  ( marc anthony )  ,  with the recommendation of his old friend rayburn  ( christopher walken )  ,  to be the bodyguard of his young daughter pita  ( dakota fanning )  and his wife lisa  ( radha mitchell )  .  pita changes the behavior of the cold creasy ,  making him live and smile again ,  and he feels a great affection for her .  when the girl is kidnapped and creasy is informed that she was murdered by the criminals ,  he swears to kill each one responsible for the abduction .    " man on fire "  is almost a masterpiece ,  and will become certainly a classic in the future .  the story is excellent ,  never corny and although having 146 minutes running time ,  the viewer does not feel time passing .  the cast is composed by excellent actors and actresses ,  their performances are outstanding ,  highlighting denzel washington ,  dakota fanning and radha mitchell .  the cinematography has wonderful moments ,  and the screenplay has stunning lines .  i personally loved when the character of christopher walken explains to manzano  ( giancarlo giannini )  that creasey's specialty is death ,  and he is preparing his masterpiece .  i agree with the user that commented that  " man on fire "  is one of the best ,  if not the best ,  film of the year in this genre .  my vote is ten .   title  ( brazil )  :   " chamas da vingança "   (  " flames of the revenge "  ) 
i am amazed that movies like this can still be made .  i watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen .  never thinked that a movie of 146 minutes can make me think about it on and on .   washington ,  charismatic and intense as ever ,  plays creasy ,  a washed-up ex-counter-terrorist agent who's taken to the bottle .  once he's assigned to protect young pita  ( dakota fanning )  in mexico city ,  his emotional and redemptive arc is jump-started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide .  inevitably ,  pita is kidnapped by thugs ,  and creasy decides that most of mexico city must pay the price for daring to take away his character's teddy-bear-clutching catalyst .  yes ,  he has become .  .  . a man on fire .    you must see this movie . 
it's hard to top this movie in several ways .  everything works really well here ;  the casting ,  acting ,  script ,  and cinematography are all first-rate .  for the moviegoer ,  it's a moving ,  violent story of love and human redemption .  for the film critic ,  there's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit .  there are some tactical blunders ,  and as has been discussed on the boards ,  the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the cia agent training angle .  however ,  i took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the cia agent's pragmatic approach ,  creasy basically commends his soul to the ultimate without considering the consequences .  like jesus himself ,  creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice ,  whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not .  in any case ,  i appreciated the fact that creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice ,  which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent .    in any case ,  this film is very much worth watching if you're at all attracted to the genre .  an excellent soundtrack ,  great writing ,  flawless casting ,  and solid performances across the board make this a top-100  ( or better )  film . 
man on fire ,  is definitely one of the best drama/crime thrillers i have ever seen .  despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well .  this is denzel washington's perfect role ,  in which he plays a body guard ,  called creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protégée ,  pita .  dakota fanning plays pita ,  the very smart ,  enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things ,  and acts in a very convincing manner ,  she has a great future ahead of her .  as i said the story is somewhat complicated ,  in order to fully understand it ,  you must watch it a couple of times .   this film is made in two parts ,  there's the first hour ,  where everyone is happy ,  nothing's wrong ,  everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of pita occurs and where creasy is almost killed .  and then there's the second part ,  the rest of the film ,  where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing ,  when creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and  " la hermamdad "  that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of pita .   denzel washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them .  it is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough ,  washington really deserved another oscar for his performance ,  and so did fanning and the director .  and even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality .   if you like excellent ,  slightly deranged ,  suspenseful thrillers ,  this is the one to see .  the most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters !  10/10
this comment does contain spoilers !  !   there are few actors that have an intangible to them .  that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma ,  panache and swagger .  it's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great .  i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson .  you can look at clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word good-bye to andy garcia in ocean's 11 when they just utter each other's name disdainfully .   " terry .  "   " danny .  "  you can pick any number of jack's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene .  these guys just have it .  you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does .  if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee's film of the same name ,  you can see that there is no finer an actor working today .  i don't mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel's work ,  but he is definitely the cog of the production .  i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw ,  emotional and incendiary all at the same time .   washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives .  he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led .  he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man .  his friend and perhaps mentor ,  played very reservedly by christopher walken ,  is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich .  apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s . e . a . l . s and such can do very well while providing a needed service .  creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty .  marc anthony is fine as samuel ,  radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita .  i don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy .  the film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role ,  perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly .  but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role .   it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema .  together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them .  tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better .  i am interested to see how his next film ,  domino ,  turns out .  i think scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one ,  his name will surely be elevated to icon status .   the story has creasy really taking to pita ,  and vis-ca versa .  there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad ,  he is not around much .  he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family .  soon ,  creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition .  he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear  " creasy "  .  it's not just a friendship between them ,  it is more of a kinship ,  and a deep parental love seems to be present .    the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her .  this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion .  and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force .  like i said earlier ,  i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day ,  but never have i seen him like this .  he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead ,  he becomes a literal man on fire .  it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance .  denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita's violation .  this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind .    also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance .  i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily .  they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die .  but not in this film .  writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful .  the perpetrators here feel creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes .  there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice .  he needs information and someone loses a finger .  he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things .  there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film .   man on fire is one the five best films of 2004 .  now that it is out on dvd ,  my recommendation is to get the se .  it is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks .  10/10
this is an excellent ,  heartbreaking movie .  it is by far the best i've seen that depicts the current reality in latin america .  .  . kidnappings ,  corruption ,  ruthless and greedy police officials and heartless mayhem towards innocent victims .  denzel washinton gives the most moving performance in his career ,  in my opinion .  dakota fanning is an amazing young actress .  the relationship between washington and fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed ,  i believed every minute .  the cast is brilliant ,  christopher walken ,  mickey rourke are great as always .  walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor .  i would have loved to see more of both of them .  the authentic locations are remarkable .  the camera work is interesting and different .  there are many famous latin actors in the cast ,  making it all the more interesting for people familiar with latin american cinema .  i highly recommend this movie . 
man on fire was hot .  i love a classic tale of good ol' revenge ,  and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl .   the writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between creasy  ( denzel washington )  and pita  ( dakota fanning )  so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive creasy had to rescue pita .  it was also good that creasy wasn't a choir boy type trying to rescue pita through the  " proper "  channels ,  but instead used torture tactics and street smarts .  some may say ,   " torture is wrong regardless ,  "  and you may be right ,  but when you see the pain creasy goes through due to the loss of pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back ,  you can't help but side with creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless .  there would be no progress if creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that .   creasy's quest ended with the return of pita to her mother and creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys .  but creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie ,  it in fact enhanced it by showing that creasy was willing to die to get pita back .  his death was noble in fact .   denzel does an excellent job as do the writers .  this movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie . 
i get teased all the time by family and friends for my tears over movies ,  and they were not disappointed when i watched this one .  i cried numerous times but believe me it was not over sappiness .  i ached for the family and i ached for this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew how .  denzel was fabulous as always ,  and so was chris walkin .  mickey rourke ,  i did not even recognized though ;  the years have not been kind to him .  my husband is not one to re-watch movies unless they are historically accurate war movies ( snore !  !  !  !  )  he has watched this movie 5 times now and i am going to have to get the dvd to watch it again because he has worn out the tape and it jumped the whole time i was watching . 
when i remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it .  it was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview ,  its stunning ,  and then when it comes out ,  you hear nothing and totally miss it ,  and your memory totally doesn't correct the mistake of missing it .  man on fire was one of those movies .  i was curious on a rental one time ,  and i decided to take it home with me ,  my precious blockbuster rental in my hands .  i watched it ,  and witnessed such a beautiful movie .  it is like none other .  .  . drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular .  the cinematography done by tony scott is extremely well done and unique ,  unlike another movie .  the subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices ,  and the music is very intriguing for the setting .  i got into this movie ,  and ended up buying it as soon as i could scurry out of the household and head over to best buy .  i've watched it several times now .  denzel washington  ( creasy )  does an amazing job with becoming this lost-minded ex-special forces man with no reason to live .  dakota fanning  ( pita )  puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start .  they bond and become good friends ,  until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood ,  la hermandad .  creasy  ( denzel )  tells the mother of dakota fanning that he will hunt down the killers ,  fearing that pita is dead .  this is where creasy really shows the person he can become .  he uses his contacts from pita's kidnapping and creasy's hospitalization to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit .  my favorite line of all ,  is in this movie ,  when christopher walken tells the afi agent that  " a man is a work of art ,  in anything that he does .  .  .  . cooking ,  whatever .  creasy's art is death .  .  . he's about to paint his masterpiece .  "  he plays a very unique roll of creasy's old partner and friend .  after finally pursuing the brother of  " the voice ,  "  leader of la hermandad .  creasy arranges a meeting to trade pita for himself and the voice's brother .  in the end ,  creasy dies from being shot earlier ,  and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss .  it is a very sincere and sad ending ,  but a great one .  i love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick .  the story is in depth ,  everything is explained from beginning to end ,  and nothing corny at all in any way or manner . 
-kidnappings in mexico are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if you're rich then you'll need a good bodyguard to keep you and your kids safe .  a couple hires a washed up bodyguard called creasy to protect their adorable kid pita .  at first ,  their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while ,  creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a father/daughter relationship .  one day pita is kidnapped and creasy is badly injured in the process .  when he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a ransom negotiations that went wrong and this sets creasy on a path find the men responsible for her death and make sure they are brought to his brand of justice .   -keep some tylenol next to you while watching this movie because you will need to take some after watching it .  i really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right .  the only problem is the annoying visual style ,  which will either make you hate the movie or hate tony scott .  i really feel sorry for the cinematographer because i'm sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the dp for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like it's been possessed by demons .  i wouldn't have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when it's spread through out the whole movie then that's when we have some problems .  the same annoying style was recently used on  " domino "  and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie .   -another person i feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great harry gregson williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images .  somehow ,  williams wrote some decent music for the movie but i'm sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better .  the sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience ,  it rather makes you feel like you're being punished .  the overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it .  i don't know why scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the movie .   -the acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals .  little fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart .  if the end of the movie doesn't make anyone cry then they're dead on the inside .  denzel washington breaks his rule of not making any action movies with this movie and luckily ,  for him he gets to play a great character .  the whole idea of a man that's lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character .  i love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge .  radha mitchell plays marc anthony's wife and she along with fanning are the two reasons why i can't hate the movie too much .  j . lo's husband comes and goes in the movie but he doesn't really stand out much .  mickey rourke and chris walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact .   -one thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie .  a little too late for that if you ask me .  let's hope that tony scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him can and must do better than this . 
you know you're in for something different when a movie has christopher walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys !  although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there ,   " man on fire "  is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between .   denzel washington stars as creasy ,  a former cia assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed .  so far ,  he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the bible and not doing all that well with either .  as the movie opens ,  mexico city has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well-to-do ,  possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community .  creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety .  the first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between creasy and his charge ,  pita ,  a sweet little girl who ,  slowly but surely ,  works her way into creasy's initially hardened heart and affections .  the last two-thirds of the film turns into an avenging angel melodrama ,  as creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story .   based on the novel by a . j quinnell ,   " man on fire ,  "  astutely written by brian helgeland and flashily directed by tony scott ,  is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter .  it takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is ,  for all intents and purposes ,  achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering  ( admittedly disreputable )  people .  these scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful ,  even if they do at times border on the exploitative .  even better are the quiet ,  intimate moments between creasy and pita in the early parts of the movie .  washington and the wonderful dakota fanning establish an natural ,  easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow .   washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness ,  making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually .  in addition to the two leads ,  there are solid performances from walken ,  marc anthony ,  radha mitchell ,  mickey rourke ,  rachel ticotin and giancarlo giannini .  but it is washington and the delightful ms .  fanning who steal the show .    " man on fire "  would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time ,  but this is still a better-than-average crime thriller . 
although released among a flock of revenge-minded action flicks  ( kill bill vol .  2 ;  the punisher ;  walking tall )  ,  man on fire works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always-watchable denzel washington ,  one of the best actors around today .   in man on fire ,  based on a . j .  quinnell's 1980 novel  ( first filmed in 1987 ,  with scott glenn )  ,  washington plays a down-on-his-luck ex-mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of jack daniels ,  until his old partner  ( christopher walken )  offers him a chance at redemption .  he is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year-old daughter  ( dakota fanning )  of a mexican businessman  ( marc antony )  and his american-born wife  ( radha mitchell )  .  while he and fanning work like oil and water first  ( not mixing very well )  ,  he really gets to form a bond with her ,  encouraging her to do better at swimming ,  while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past .  it is that very bond that will force washington back into his old line of work when fanning is kidnapped and held for a $10 million ransom ,  and he is nearly killed .  with almost any other stock action hero  ( schwarzenneger ;  segal ,  etc .  )  ,  the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before .  but washington's character ,  though he's killing for a reason ,  does not particularly enjoy doing what he does .  still ,  he gets help from a very intrepid mexican newspaper reporter  ( rachel ticotin )  out to expose  " la hermanidad "   ( the brotherhood )  ,  the kidnap gang responsible for fanning's abduction .   man on fire is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work ,  nearly headache-inducing montage editing ,  and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director tony scott  ( top gun ;  crimson tide )  ,  but which are not necessarily unique to him  ( witness oliver stone's use of montage in jfk or sam peckinpah's in his classic 60s and 70s films )  .  still ,  scott gets a very good performance from washington ,  as well as fanning ,  who comes across as far more than a typical movie-brat kid .  harry gregson-williams' south-of-the-border spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of chopin ,  debussy ,  and even linda ronstadt's classic 1977 country-rock version of  " blue bayou .  "  although the film overall is quite violent ,  it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years ,  and overall it is much better than most . 
there are many reasons to watch this movie :  to see the reality that whips latin america with regard to the kidnappings thing ,  the police corruption at continental level ,  among so many realities that we live the latins .    the performance of denzel wahington was brilliant ,  this guy continues being an excellent actor and that it continues this way .  dakota fanning just by 10 years ,  an excellent actress has become and i congratulate her .  the rest of the movie was of marvel ,  i have it in my collection .    i hope that they are happened to those producing of hollywood to make a movie completely in venezuela ,  where they show our reality better with regard to the delinquency ,  the traffic of drugs or the political problems .  they have been few the movies that they play venezuelan land  ( for example :  aracnophobia ,  jungle 2 jungle ,  dragonfly )  they should make more ,  as well as they make in mexico .   the song  " una mirada "  i hope that it leaves in the soundtrack ,  it is excellent .  my vote is 10/10
i liked this film a lot .  it's dark ,  it's not a bullet-dodging ,  car-chasing numb your brain action movie .  a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague ,  leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions .  it's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds .   in the end ,  motivated by love or vengeance ,  or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is  " right "  .  'will god ever forgive us for what we've done ? ' - it's not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do ,  what he's good at ,  what he's been trained to do .   denzel washington is a great actor - i honestly can't think of one bad movie he's done - and he's got a great supporting cast .  i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone . 
here's a gritty ,  get-the-bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough denzel washington .  he's three personalities here :  a down-and-out-low-key-now drunk- former mercenary ,  then a loving father-type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge .   the story is about washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little american girl living in mexico ,  where kidnappings of children occur regularly  ( at least according to the movie .  )  he becomes attached to the kid ,  played winningly by the child actress of our day ,  dakota fanning .  when fanning is kidnapped in front of him ,  washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one .  beware :  this film is not for the squeamish .   this is stylish film-making ,  which is good and bad .  i liked it ,  but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera-work is one that could give you a headache .  i thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view ,  but it's  ( the shaky camera )  not for all tastes .   besides the two stars ,  there is the always-interesting christopher walken ,  in an uncharacteristically low-key role ,  and a number of other fine actors .   the film panders to the base emotions in all of us ,  but it works . 
mean-spirited ,  ugly ,  nasty retro-action thriller ,  about a bodyguard who is determined to find  ( and destroy !  )  ,  the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect .  this film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere .  director scott doesn't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film's dramatic structure .  scott is either not aware or doesn't care for 30 years of social advances .  i really don't think we will see a more violent film any time soon ,  so you better go and see this one while you can .  despite its relentless grimness ,  i think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister ,  exploitative ,  and effective .  scott has a tough thing to sell ,  but i think i'm a buyer .  the extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore .  scott's directorial choices are simply astonishing ,  and he pulls a great performance out of denzel washington .  sensitive souls need to stay away from this one ,  but i recommended it to those viewers looking for a great ,  action-filled movie . 
this is by far one of the better made movies and didn't leave me disappointed at all .  the sound track along with finely shot hand-held camera work was exquisite  .  the are always chances a movie won't hold ones beliefs as well as another ,  but i felt that rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent .  dakota fanning is rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent .  as for mr .  washington and of course christopher walken they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light . 
i loved this movie .  i'm a mexican and was in the least offended by it .  in fact ,  i think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over mexico .  it's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse .  it angers me to read in the news how killers ,  kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells .  we should have someone like creasy ,  denzel washington's character .  a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante .  kidnapping is flourishing industry down here  ( at least in the big cities )  .  i actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's creasy did his fine job upon .  that would be so marvelous  ( sorry ,  i am that resentful !  )  .  man on fire is a gripping film that you can't miss .  it might be hard on some of you ,  if you aren't used to reading subtitles  ( mexicans do that all the time while watching american movies )  but the effort will be well worth it .  some of the editing is a bit fuzzy .  .  . kind of like traffic ,  remember ?   ( another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is )  .  the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half .  i swear you'll be cheering as you watch denzel washington dispatch the wrong doers .  his performance is nothing short of excellent .  the ending  ( no spoilers ,  ok !  !  !  )  is a bit sad ,  but i'm sure you'll like it anyway .  man on fire is one of the year's best movies .  a  " must own "  for a dvd collection !  9* out of 10
he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator ;  in this case ,  portraying attorney  ( and murderer )  tom capano .   kathryn morris is sympathetic as victim ,  anne marie fahey ,  but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim .  we are sorry for the situation ,  but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women  ( including rachel ward )  as well .   the sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self-esteem issues ,  and capano actually had her psychologist killed .  pretty hard to believe ,  but this was based on a true story .   there is a cameo with olympia dukakis  ( excellent )  as capano's mother .  all in all ,  an interesting story because it is based on a true murder ,  and you will want to read ann rule's book to get the accurate details .  8/10 . 
this has to be one of the best ,  if not the best film i have seen for a very ,  very long time .  had enough action to satisfy an fan ,  and yet the plot was very good .  i really enjoyed the film , and had me hooked from start to finish .   added blood and gore in there ,  but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film ,  and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should think .   it is a must watch for anyone .  seen many reviews ,  slating the film ,  but to be fair ,  most the films that get bad reviews ,  turn out to be some of the best .  this proves it once again .   rent this film ,  buy this film ,  just go out and watch this film .  you will not be disappointed . 
 .  .  . dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial ,  brain-dead and pointless .  the film is excellent ,  the acting by both denzel and dakota  ( she will go sky high ,  trust me on that ) are just fabulous ,  and the plot is mind blowing .  actually  " fabulous "  is a small word to use for such talented actors .  the film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional ,  a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film .  if you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films ,  you still haven't watched your favorite one yet .  .  . trust me ,  in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling .  the film is awesome ,  see it ,  rent it ,  buy it or whatever .  .  . just don't miss it
certainly one of the finest movies i have seen for quite some time .  exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film .  denzel washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date ,  and the rest of the cast perform beautifully .  christopher walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as i would have liked .  a story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love .  this is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets ,  rockets and revenge .  the location of mexico city adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener .  all in all ,  a truly gripping film from beginning to end .  highly recommended ! 
i have seen maslin beach a couple of times - both on free to air tv in brisbane .  i won't go into whether it is good ,  bad or otherwise as others have well and truly covered this .   i will say that it is so australian .  only in australia can we have a film about relationships among people spending the day as naked as the day they were born ,  and to view it on free commercial television .   i have a friend from the us who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free tv compared to her home country .  sex and the city and huff are just too examples .   despite our government trying to turn us into the 51st us state ,  it is good to know at least some things remain truly aussie
this movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend .  there are laughs galore and some very interesting little nudist stories going on here .  the actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty .  maslin beach life is full of diverse nudists and personality types .  the australian coast scenery is ,  simply ,  splendid to see .  what a place to visit ,  to say the least ,  and one day it may become my hideaway .  i really enjoy this movie and every time i watch it i enjoy it more .  i would love to see more of these characters and i always wonder what became of them .  although the plot is somewhat soft ,  this movie is ,  of course ,  a great excuse to just sit back on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories . 
maslin beach is a real nudist/naturist beach south of adelaide ,  on the fleurieu peninsula ,  in south australia .  it is also the name of an australian film that used the beach as a location .   maslin beach is labelled a romantic comedy .  this could be slightly misleading ,  as it is not a 'hilarious' film ,  nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense ,  but it does have light-hearted moments .  much as life itself ,  there are also moments of sadness too .  it is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above ,  and nudity runs throughout the length of film .  the viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal ,  and concentrate on the plot ,  not the copious amount of flesh .   simon and marcie  ( michael allen and eliza lovell )  arrive by car at a beach-side car park .  they take their belongings to the beach ,  and while they are walking ,  a voice-over from simon talks about his confusion about what real love is .  the rest of the film is an exploration of this ,  framed by one complete day at the beach .  the basic story is of what happens to simon's love life ,  but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignettes .   when they arrive at the beach ,  both simon and marcie appear bored with each other .  marcie sees them as a 'romeo and juliet' romantic couple .  simon is just bored with it all .  next ,  we are introduced to gail  ( bonnie-jaye lawrence )  ,  paula  ( zara collins )  and jenny  ( jennifer ross )  .  they are walking down the beach together discussing gail's chances of finding the 'perfect' man ,  aided by the 'powers' of a necklace that brought good luck to her grandmother .  however ,  there are many more interesting people on the beach ,  not all of them 'attractive' and young  ( part of the realism of this film )  .   to service the beach's patrons there is a flatulent ,  short-sighted ice-cream salesperson with a van .  this is ben  ( gary waddell )  ,  who is a friend of simon ,  and is also his unofficial counsellor .  i would think that this character is the main comic element .  it is hard to say though ,  as there is nothing about ben that would make you laugh aloud ,  unless you were intoxicated ,  male and very young !  maslin beach does have a major redeeming feature though ,  and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject .  as the quality of acting is variable ,  the script is suspect and everything about maslin beach is cheap ,  the lack of continuity is a positive boon .  in fact ,  there is something about this film  ( not the nudity )  that i find appealing .  it is hard to define what it is ,  but it could be something to do with its bluntness ,  and downright 'aussie' attitude to carnal matters .   the camera work in maslin beach deserves a mention .  sometimes it is very good ,  with some stunning static shots and 'pans' of the beach ,  cliffs and a sunset .  as nudity is a major factor in this film ,  framing is an important aspect of the camera work .  there is no sense of gratuity in the framing ,  meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on 'private' body parts .  this helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subject's 'personal space' ,  and makes the film more tasteful .  not an easy task ,  given the location for filming .   maslin beach is neither a 'skin flick' for post-pubescent ,  testosterone charged males ,  nor a 'mills and boon' romance for under-appreciated women .  maslin beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre .  the actors are not 'attractive' in the baywatch sense ,  and are just 'normal' people that you would see on the beach anywhere .  it does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement ,  other than perhaps to naturists .  apart from the australian accent ,  the filming could have been in any sunny country .  what makes this film distinctly australian is the fact that it is pointless  ( cinema verite ?  )  ,  and only australian cinema ,  and other medium sized national cinemas ,  could consider such a rash option .  at the same time ,  these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity ,  and a 'flop' is not going to damage their reputation too much .  it is always possible ,  given that maslin beach is now a collector's item ,  that the film might become internationally popular ,  but it is very unlikely .   during this critique ,  i have been sounding highly negative ,  at times ,  about maslin beach .  this is not the real position ,  as i found the film very easy to watch .  i enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people  ( and problems )  .  the problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday ,  and a little low on spectacle .  this does it no harm in my view ,  and i wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this .  there is a connection here with the cinemas of europe ,  and with french film in particular .  they rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes ,  but with the everyday .  hollywood is in direct opposition to this ,  and rides the crest of the hyper-real action/drama/angst wave .  the pace too ,  is much faster in hollywood ,  but it is not reality .  maslin beach is not exactly 'jacques tati' either ,  but it is on the right track ,  even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism ,  equality ,  gender orientation and so on ,  that are of such importance in current cinema .  i am sure that you will either love or hate this film ,  with little room for a middle ground .   
i bought this game on ebay having heard that it was a similar game to elite .  the gameplay is indeed very similar ,  and is very addictive .  once i'd played it a couple of times ,  i immediately went back on ebay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too .  .  .  .  i have played this game right through and the storyline makes it feel as if you are actually in a movie ,  it's brilliant .  if you have trouble feeling free to explore because of the restrictive nature of the storyline in the single-player game ,  simply set up a freelancer server on your own pc  ( easy to do and the software is included )  and play to your heart's content .  there are still a huge number of freelancer servers on the internet ,  so multiplayer is no problem and is not all that threatening ,  because you don't often meant other players unless you want to .  so go get a copy of this game ,  learn it by playing the single-player campaign ,  then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself .  the depth of this game is staggering ,  with huge systems to explore and wrecks to find ,  as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets ,  wormholes ,  secret bases ,  the list is nearly endless .  fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple of quid on ebay .  get one with the full written manual if you can  ( blue box ,  not xplosiv red box )  ,  it's loads better ! 
this is a great game !  okay perhaps it didn't have some of the features it was meant to have but digital anvil have still come up with a good game .  there is a certain similarity to elite ( you can trade ,  pick up weapons and cargo off destroyed ships ,  go on missions ) however this game features a heavily scripted mission .  it is a great mission .  the control system is different it uses the mouse !  you basically fly you spaceship around a system and work your way up !  the game features some pretty good graphics even through it was made in 2003 .  it should run well on even a modestly specified pc .  the story features some great voice acting from john rhys davies ,  george takei ,  jennifer hale ( she appears in every computer game )  .  stick with the story it gets better and better as it goes on .  there is even a race section ,  where you and an opponent have to race your spaceships around a course ( it involves you going through rings )  .  this section took me a while to beat .  it adds variety to the game .  some sections are a little tough here and there but overall you can beat this game .  the game has an active mod scene on the net .  pick up some mods to extend the game .  i haven't played any of the mods yet .    sadly a sequel to this was cancelled ,  a shame ! 
this game is very addictive ,  i kept playing it for hours straight until late at night but also the fact that you can't save a game when you are in space contributed to this ,  at times i just had to play on in order not to loose any game data .   so yes ,   " freelancer "  is addictive but also quite flawed .  also for instance ,  something that extremely bothered me was that you couldn't skip any of the cut scene's with as a result that at times you had to watch the same few minute cut scene time after time .  a great opportunity for me to multitask to check my e-mail or have a chat with my friends and more things like that ,  while i had to wait for the cut scene to be over .   the story starts of promising but the further you get the more ridiculous it all gets .  also the game also ends quite abrupt ,  at least it did so for me .  it is quite obvious that they are hinting at a upcoming sequel .  i don't know if a sequel is in the works at the moment but i am sure that most likely i will pick one up once it will be released .   the gameplay is very easy !  even for those who are not familiar with flight games .  to put it boldly ,  every fool can play this game .  yes ,  some levels are quite hard and require lots of effort .  it took me about 1-2 weeks for me to finish this game which might be a bit too short .  but thank god for the multi-player option !  it allows you to keep playing short missions ,  just like the single player game once you have completed it by the way .   even though lot's of mission are the same ,  it just simply stays cool to be in the middle of the at times massive dogfights .   the graphics are good but just not anything revolutionary or anything .   addictive game but beware of its flaws .   7/10
as far as i know ,  this show was never repeated on uk television after its original run in the late '60s / early '70s ,  and most episodes are now sadly  " missing presumed wiped "  .   series 6 from 1971 however still exists in its entirety ,  and i recently got the chance to watch it all ,  the best part of 4 decades on .   after rushing home from school ,  freewheelers was essential viewing for me and many of my contemporaries back in those halcyon days of flared trousers ,  slade and chicory tip .  and watching it again brought a nostalgic lump to the throat .   never mind the bad / hammy acting ,  the unintentionally amusing fight scenes ,  plot holes wide enough to pilot a large ocean-going yacht through and the  " frightfully ,  frightfully "  rada accents of the lead players .   no - forget all that .  because freewheelers harks back to a bygone  ( dare i say  " golden "  )  age of kids' tv drama ,  when the shows were simply about rip-roaring fun and didn't take themselves so seriously .  before they became obsessed with all the angst-laden  " ishoos "  that today's screenwriters have their young protagonists fret over ,  such as relationships ,  pregnancy ,  drugs ,  stis etc .   no doubt if it were  " remade for a modern audience "  in these days of all-pervasive political correctness ,  the boss figure would be a black female ,  one of the young male heroes would be a muslim ,  the other would be a white lad confused about his sexuality and the girl would be an all-action go-getter with an iq off the scale ,  who'd be forever getting the lads out of scrapes and making them look foolish - in other words a million miles removed from wendy padbury's deferential ,  ankle-spraining washer-upper .   it's a show that's very much  " of its time "  .  but is that a bad thing ?  i for one don't think so . 
ah ,  true memories .  i lived in holland at the time and looked eagerly forward to it every sunday evening and later tuesdays .  i saw it during my 14-16s .  very good for my  ( at the time school- ) english ,  as dutch tv provides subtitles for other languages ,  except for kiddies shows nowadays .  so you would hear the original voices and language .  - the best series were the first three ones and then after the third series ,  the great character ,  nazi von gelb ,  who was such a formidable enemy ,  disappeared from the series  ( i don't think they ever really caught him ,  he always escaped ,  leaving room to have him appear again in a next story )  because evidently the series also was distributed to germany ,  and a nazi enemy wouldn't go over very well !  too bad ,  because geoffrey toone did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent nazi aristocrat ,  who had this ongoing obsession to take revenge on england .  it was a true delight to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series ,  but ronald leigh-hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal .  they were very believable to me at the time and as a kid i could just imagine to be part of these youngsters ,  who at the time were about four years older than me .  it was a very exciting series to me ,  standing out in my memory of those times as a special show with  " the prisoner "  as well .  i hope they will publish a good quality dvd of the series ,  that would be wonderful .  even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch .  the later series were not as good ,  watered down and just not as much fun as the first three .  hopefully they also find the other series with von gelb to be put on dvd .  greetings from canada . 
i couldn't have been more thrilled ;  just eight years old back in 1983 ,  i was going to see a star wars movie at the theater !  the best day of my life was about to happen .  to that time ,  my only star wars experience had been a few hbo showings of star wars .  i hadn't even seen the empire strikes back yet .   and boy ,  did that day deliver for my less critical eyes .  jabba .  big rebel spaceships .  the emporer .  a green-bladed lightsaber !  !  wow !  since that magical day ,  i must have watched this movie hundreds of times .  i can't even form an accurate estimate at this point .  with those multiple viewings ,  i have of course observed that this movie - the real episode iii - does have its flaws .   of course in the context of a star wars movie ,  those  " flaws "  are more like  " quirks "  .   millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980 .  in may of 1983 ,  i had mine .  and this was my star wars movie . 
i previously thought that this film was the lamest of the muppet films .  i would like now to retract that statement .  in my opinion now ,  the lamest muppet film was the tv movie it's a very merry muppet christmas ,  am it's a wonderful life rip off that was truly dreadful .  muppets take manhattan is nothing special ,  but miles more enjoyable than merry muppet christmas .    the best songs are that 'you can't take no for an answer' song ,  the one the muppet babies sing and the songs for the big finale itself .  as i loved the muppet babies tv show ,  i loved the muppet babies sequence here  ( i'm told that it was what inspired the muppet babies show )    the manhattan melodies show itself was the real showstopper ,  with muppets from sesame street even appearing for the wedding .  as kermit puts it in his final line 'what better way could anything end ? ' .  but i wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining .  there are cute cameos from brooke shields and gregory hines and a great dance sequence from rizzo and the rats  ( choreographed by the late ,  great jim henson himself )  and the film certainly entertains .  i must state though that muppet movie ,  great muppet caper and muppet christmas carol are the three defininitive muppet movies . 
this was the best muppet movie i've seen ever !  i happen to know that miss piggy's fantasy of meeting as infants was the cause of muppet babies .  the songs will remain in my head forever .  only saying so because that stupid nickelodeon show hey dude song still remains in my head .  sorry ,  a little off the topic there .  but anyway what i like is animal after the credits saying  " bye bye !  bye bye !  bye bye !  bye bye !  bye bye !  hasta luego !  "  that made me laugh so hard .  my absolute favorite is the play at the end .  i was surprised that the sesame street characters popped in at the wedding .  i'm just glad this movie was very entertaining .  i borrowed it from the library ,  and now i have bought it because i can't keep the library's copy forever .  in conclusion ,  i proclaim this is the best movie i've ever seen !  in my case ,  it's even better than austin powers in goldmember ,  which was my favorite movie ! 
as far as the muppet line goes ,  however ,  this is not the best ,  nor the second best .  this was marketed towards the kiddies ,  but has some dark ,  and emotionally upsetting adult moments ,  to which parents may not wish to expose their children .  one of which showcases miss piggy going  " postal "  in a jealous rage ,  which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work .   beyond that ,  however ,  the story is progressive ,  and highly entertaining .  one scene in which joan rivers and miss piggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious !  and there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of levity and fun .   i like this very much ,  and enjoy it still today .   it rates a 7 . 6/10 from .  .  .   the fiend  :  . 
yes ,  it's another great magical muppet's movie and i adore them all ;  the characters ,  the movies ,  the tv show episodes  ( it's the best comedy or musical tv show ever )  and all the artists behind it .  but here they did such a rare fatal mistake and i'm surely talking about the weird ending  !  !    i think it's very dangerous to involve that much ,  in american drama ,  and end a love affair by marriage  !  !  we ,  as all the poor viewers ,  feel so free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance ,  peevishness and misery  !  so we all enjoy these stories which gather 2 cute heroes as couple in love without the legitimate bond like mickey mouse and minnie ,  superman and lois lane ,  dick tracy and tess ,  etc .  so with all of the previous couples and their likes i bet that you feel safe ,  serenity and peace .  therefore when you look at what the makers of this movie had already done you'll be as mad as me  !   they made the weak miserable creature  ( kermit )  marry his daily nightmare ,  the most vexatious female ever  ( miss piggy )   !  this is a historical change by the measures of the american entertainment's industry  !  and it was pretty normal to have a negative impact upon the audience whom just refused to bless or believe or being satisfied with that sudden marriage  ( even the pathetic frog didn't have the time or the proper opportunity to think or to decide anything  !  )  .  therefore no wonder at all when you know that this movie is the most failure one in their cinematic serious ,  grossing only 25 millions vis-à-vis 65 millions earned by the first one  ( the muppet movie  1979 )  five years earlier  !  !   simply in this movie they took manhattan ,  and my rest too  ! 
but if you like the muppets i defy you to dislike this one .  basically the same plot regurgitated  ( this time new york ,  not la )  it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx .  a lot of the muppets leave the film pretty early on as it centers around kermy and miss piggy .  i happened to have enjoyed it greatly .  fun to watch with your kids . 
i first saw this movie in the theater when i was 8 years old and it still cracks me up .  the muppets are so cool and they approach show business in a refreshingly naive way .  my favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of kermit at a fancy restaurant .  this is one smart and funny movie for kids and parents alike .  long live kermit ,  miss piggy and the rest of the gang . 
don't think of this movies as just another kids movie - the whole family can enjoy it .  its a strange mix of a movie ,  as its seems to have a movie within it ,  but at least it does make sense at the end  ( unlike modern films !  )  it does give you all the elements of a film  ( decent plot ,  good characters - well it does star the muppets ,  a list of lesser celebs* which films would clamour for )  what is surprising ,  is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions ,  some sad ,  some heartwarming ,  some funny and some serious - it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together .   * the celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine miss piggy !  !  !  ! 
stars :  julianna donald ,  lonny price and louis zorich .  cameos :  art carney ,  brooke sheilds ,  liza minelli ,  james coco ,  joan rivers ,  dabney coleman ,  linda lavin ,  gregory hines and others .   muppeteers :  jim henson as kermit ,  rowlf ,  dr . teeth ,  swedish chef ,  waldorf ,  ernie and others .   richard hunt as scooter ,  janice ,  statler and beaker .   frank oz as fozzie bear ,  miss piggy ,  animal ,  bert ,  cookie monster and sam the eagle .   jerry nelson as camilla the chicken ,  floyd pepper ,  lew zealand ,  crazy harry and pops .   dave goelz as gonzo ,  zoot ,  beuregard and bunsen hunnydew .   steve whittemire as rizzo the rat and others .   another great muppet flick .  this time ,  kermit ,  fozzie ,  miss piggy ,  scooter ,  rowlf ,  the electric mayhem ,  gonzo and camilla the chicken are out of college and starring in a musical that they're trying to get on broadway .  after miserably failing at getting it produced ,  they all split up and go their separate ways .  i love the characters and cameos .  the songs in the film are  " together again "  ,   " look at me ,  here i am "  ,   " saying goodbye "  ,   " and i'm going to always love you "  ,   " rat jazz "  and  " he'll make me happy "  .  frank oz directs this movie excellently and all the actors do a great job acting like the muppets are real .  see it !  91 minutes .  rated g .  my rating :  a . 
in this muppet movie ,  kermit ,  miss piggy ,  fozzie ,  gonzo ,  rowlf ,  scooter ,  camillia ,  dr .  teeth ,  floyd ,  animal ,  janice ,  and zoot are college graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical ,  manhattan melodies ,  to broadway .  unfortunately ,  no producer will even meet with the muppets .  after being denied by too many producers ,  scooter suggests that the muppets decide to move on on their own .  however ,  kermit still believes that he can get his show on broadway ,  but after he finally does and let's everybody know that he sold the show ,  kermit get's amnesia and the others don't know where he is .   this features many great scenes ,  including a live action sequence that introduced the muppet babies ,  a wedding sequence filled with muppets ,  including the sesame street cast and traveling matt  ( from fraggle rock )  ,  scooter as a movie theatre usher ,  and a scene where rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast .   my only complaint is that more characters weren't included more .  sure ,  many of them appear at the wedding ,  but there should have been some significant roles for bunsen ,  beaker ,  beauregard ,  and sweetums ,  and lips should have been part of the electric mayhem in this movie like he was in the muppet show's last season and the great muppet caper ,  and miss piggys dog foo foo should have been with her as well  ( after all ,  rizzo the rat ,  also performed by steve whitmire ,  had a big part in this movie ,  and he wasn't very well-known at the time )  . 
i suppose jedi is now chronologically to be considered the very  " last "  entry in the popular saga ,  and it's a very good one ,  as were several of these .  i liked how directly this sequel took off after the empire strikes back ,  and i appreciated the maturity of luke skywalker as a character ( and also mark hamill ,  as an actor )  .  after hearing so many negative things about the ewoks ,  they weren't so bad .  i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods ,  and i felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter .  the ending  ( with some new additions ,  i presume ?  )  successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy .  i know many true star wars fans hated george lucas for changes he made to the original films ,  but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what i didn't already know ,  i think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity .  oh ,  and ,  err -- carrie fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit . 
 " the muppets take manhattan "  is different in a lot of ways to every other muppet movie made so far .  for one ,  it remains the only muppet film not owned by disney .  as of 2008 ,  the film still belongs to 20th century fox  ( cbs fox at the time of its release )  even though disney owns the rights to the muppets .  also ,  this film has a story line that's very non-linear ,  and events that are otherwise unpredictable .   of course ,  it's very hard to beat the original  " muppet movie "  from 1979 ,  especially since that movie had more memorable songs than  " manhattan "  does .  however ,  one way in which  " the muppets take manhattan "  is better than  " the muppet movie "  is perhaps the surprisingly realistic scenarios .  in the first movie ,  all the muppets really have to do is go to hollywood ,  walk into an agent's office ,  and they are immediately given a  " rich & famous "  contract .  in this movie ,  the muppets learn that they actually have to work for their desired success ,  and it's a lot harder to do that ,  especially in the entertainment business ,  than they initially thought .  that's an important and often times overlooked message ,  provided one is willing to suspend the disbelief that the muppets ,  being small and made of cloth ,  don't necessarily have to live in a spacious place or even eat respectively .  above all ,  their struggle to make it after graduating college creates a very good story .  another note :  the celebrity cameos in the movie were cool ,  and they surprisingly managed not to take away the spotlight from the muppets .  that ability right there is a testament to henson ,  and how appealing the muppet characters were even to adults .   where  " manhattan "  falls flat ,  and this is where i'm sure people will disagree with me ,  is with some of the key songs ,  especially in the end .  i thought the wedding song  " he'll make me happy "  was too somber for such a happy occasion as a wedding .  it sounded more like a song that's played at a funeral .  every time i watch this movie ,  hearing that song makes me unusually depressed ,  especially when the film begins on such an upbeat number as  " together again "  and ends happily for that matter .   " saying goodbye "  was a sad number too ,  but it fit better into the movie because the muppets were disbanding and weren't sure they were going to see each other again .  that last song was such a let down ,  and perhaps even added to younger viewers' misery of seeing their favorite muppets leave the big screen .    " the muppets take manhattan "  is overall a good film ,  and one that marches to the beat of a different drum than the other muppet films ,  including the newer ones made after the deaths of jim henson and richard hunt .  fortunately ,  the film marches in the same direction as well .  i just wished the film ended on a better song that wasn't quite so melancholy .  plus ,  disney should have gotten its hands on this film's copyright and given it a proper dvd release .  maybe it will someday .  we'll see . 
i found this to be the most enjoyable muppets movie ,  because i felt it was the most light-hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines .  the muppets try to go on broadway to sell an original musical they've written ,  but along the way ,  they run into the usual problems ,  including kermit's memory loss here .  while there aren't as many great cameos here as in the original  " muppets movie ,  "  there are some including joan rivers and dabney coleman .  simply the timing and delivery of so many of the lines is great ,  and the situations the muppets find themselves in are hilarious .  the original songs are also good here ,  and the ending is satisfying .  there is not much else to say about the film ,  but muppet fans should see it for sure .  it is the funniest muppet movie and is sure to be enjoyed by all .   ***1/2 out of ****
i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome .  i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed astonished .  the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperor/darth sidious .  he is about to be destroyed when darth vader ,  dark lord of the sith ,  eliminates his dark master .  a nice sacrifice .  the cinematography of this film is impressive .  i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers .  i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari ,  the ewoks ,  the sullesteian  ( lando's co pilot )  and many more .  .  .  most of my favorite scenes are in that film : 1-when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded .  2- when luke sees the spirits of obi-wan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker  ( sebastian shaw )  ( the greatest scene in star wars )  3- when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lord .   i personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader v . s luke skywalker on the death star .  post-script :  the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable .  9/10 . 
the third muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing ,  with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright  ( yet volatile )  lights of broadway filled with typically naïve optimism .  of course ,  their first attempt fails and kermit  ( leader of the group and author of the show )  blows his top ;  so ,  the others all go their separate ways so that he won't have to feel responsible for them .  kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father's diner  ( the old man ,  then ,  has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequiturs !  )  .  we get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars :  art carney  ( as a producer )  ,  james coco  ( as an overzealous dog owner )  ,  dabney coleman  ( as a confidence trickster )  ,  elliott gould  ( who was also in the muppet movie [1979] )  ,  gregory hines ,  liza minnelli  ( as herself  having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by kermit's ,  sporting fake moustache ,  as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the muppets' show )  ,  brooke shields ,  and even director john landis  ( in possibly the film's funniest scene as a broadway producer before whom kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an afro wig !  )  .  the other muppets more or less go through their typical paces ,  with  ( regrettably )  less space given to gonzo this time around ;  while miss piggy is something of an acquired taste with me ,  the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be kermit's romance with the waitress  and especially her violent reaction to this  are undeniably funny .  what disappoints ,  however ,  is the climactic show itself  ( after a fairly redundant midsection wherein kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on madison avenue )  which ,  rather than the expected splashy routines ,  procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of kermit and his eternal flame miss piggy ! 
jim henson's muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood .  this film makes me feel like a kid again .  okay ,  the muppets are back with miss piggy and kermit the frog and their friends .  the premise is that they are trying to get on broadway in a musical show in where else but new york city .  you will see cameos by the then new york city mayor ed koch .  anyway ,  the film turns 25 this year and i hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the muppets gang .  the problem with the show is kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in new york city .  it's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself . 
this was the third muppet movie and the last one jim henson was around to take part in the making of before his premature death in 1990 .  the first three films starring the famous characters were all made and released into theatres before i was born .  i originally saw the first and second installments in the original trilogy ,   " the muppet movie "  and  " the great muppet caper "  ,  around the mid-nineties ,  as a kid ,  but didn't see this third one ,   " the muppets take manhattan "  ,  until april 2007 .  this was shortly after i had seen its two predecessors and 1996's  " muppet treasure island "  for the first time in many years .  this third muppet movie definitely didn't disappoint me the first time i saw it ,  and my second viewing nearly three years later may not have impressed me as much ,  but if not ,  it certainly didn't go too far downhill .   the muppets' stage musical ,   " manhattan melodies "  ,  turns out to be a big hit on their college campus .  they are graduating from college ,  so they will soon be leaving ,  but decide they will all stay together and go to manhattan to try and get their show on broadway .  after their arrival ,  they begin searching for a producer ,  but after many rejections ,  they finally decide to part and go find jobs .  most of them leave town ,  but kermit stays ,  and is still determined to find the right producer and reunite the muppet gang .  he gets a job at a new york restaurant owned by a man named pete .  the frog quickly befriends pete's daughter ,  jenny ,  an aspiring fashion designer who currently works at her father's restaurant as a waitress .  as kermit continues his attempts to reach stardom ,  now with the help of jenny ,  he doesn't know that miss piggy has secretly stayed in new york and is now spying on him .  she begins to see kermit and jenny together ,  and to her it looks like they're getting close ,  which leads to jealousy !    when i saw this movie for the second time ,  it looked disappointing at first .  it seemed a little rushed ,  unfocused ,  and maybe even forgettable around the beginning .  there are some funny bits during this part of the film ,  such as animal chasing a woman through the audience on the college campus ,  but for a little while ,  the film seemed bland to me compared to its two predecessors .  fortunately ,  it wasn't long before that changed .  the film is entertaining for the most part ,  with  " saying goodbye "  ,  the poignant song the muppets sing as they part ,  and a lot that happens after that .  the two funniest parts might be miss piggy's tantrums after she sees kermit and jenny hugging ,  but there were definitely many other times when i laughed ,  such as poor fozzie trying to hibernate with other bears .  the muppets still have their charm and comical antics ,  which obviously also helps carry the movie for the most part ,  as does the plot ,  a simple but intriguing one for all ages .  there are some weaker moments ,  such as the muppet babies sequence ,  and juliana donald's performance as jenny is lacklustre ,  but neither of these problems are too significant ,  and are far from enough to ruin the entire experience .   i would say  " the muppet movie "  ,  the film that started the franchise in 1979 ,  is the best of the original trilogy ,  and that seems to be the most popular opinion .  this third film is probably the weakest of the three ,  but all of them are good .  unlike  " muppets from space "  ,  the third of the theatrical films in the franchise made after henson's sad passing ,  at least  " the muppets take manhattan "  is still the muppets !  i won't go into details about what i think of the muppets' 1999 film ,  released twenty years after their first one ,  since i've already explained in my review of it why i found it so disappointing ,  and even though it does have some appeal ,  i'm clearly not alone .  however ,  every theatrical movie starring the lovable muppets that was made during henson's life is good entertainment for the whole family ,  even if the second and third installment each showed a slight decline in quality after the one that directly preceded it . 
when i first saw this film in the 1980's ,  i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the  " sesame street/muppets "  age .  i honestly don't remember if i liked it at the time or not .  however ,  somewhere in college i watched this film again ,  and it wound up going  ( and staying )  into my personal best films ever collection .   this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets .  i mean ,  obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there's humor geared towards both generations .  but come on .  .  . janice is accidentally overheard telling someone  " i don't take my clothes off for anyone ,  even if it is artistic "  .  .  . there's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father doesn't want to hear it .  .  . gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation  ( sp ?  )  and afterwards says  " i think we're engaged now "  .  .  . these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling .  add to that very smart dialogue ,  very smart new york/broadway  " wink wink "  humor ,  the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don't border on  " kid-level cheesy "  whatsoever .  .  . this film is a masterpiece !  i don't throw  " 10 " 's out on a regular basis .  .  . but this one deserves it .  over 20 years later ,  this film totally holds up ,  perhaps even more so .  the muppets never were and never will be again ,  as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is .  ---q
i love this film .  the songs and story lines are great fun .  and the song  " saying goodbye "  always moves me .  what a brilliant thing to do to bring puppets to life ,  in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever .  great voices and great talent .  why were all the other muppet films that came after this one so much less interesting ,  moving and funny ?  is it that mr .  henson is just so very missed ? 
throughout this film ,  you might think this film is just for kids .  well ,  it is mainly pointed towards them ,  but it's also well-rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience .  this time around ,  the muppet gang try to get on broadway ,  with the dire straits keeping them from getting it produced ,  leading them to splitting up .  but kermit won't stop ,  and his determination keeps things moving along until after getting the deal together he gets hit by a car and sent into amnesia !    it's a send-up ,  in part ,  of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical ,  only here there's the usual lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments  ( lou zealand's boomerang fish ;  gonzo's water-stunt display ,  the whisper campaign ,  among many others )  ,  but also with a lot of heart too .  the muppet writers aren't shy of the conventions ,  on the contrary ,  they embrace them to the point where it's almost refreshing to see such a 'lets put on a show' story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream .    while not as totally original in scope as the muppet movie ,  it's got many catchy and memorable songs ,  excellent locations all over manhattan ,  and even some intonations of inter-species dating  ( and marriage )  !  cameos include liza minneli  (  " a frog ?  "  )  ,  elliot gould  ( as the cop )  ,  brooke shields  ( propositioned by a rat )  ,  edward i .  koch ,  gregory hines and joan rivers .  so get ready to sing-along ,  or just have a lot of big laughs and romantic  ( yes romantic )  times with one of the best muppet movies . 
when i saw it for the first time i was really impressed . the director made such a mysterious atmosphere ,  especially in the end .  through all the story spectators can expect that richard will really kill thomas or he will do it first . but .  . the main point was not conflict but .  . friendship ! older and mature one prayed himself to save the younger who has the whole life to life . it is amazing .  every time i watch it i enjoy ! of course it is pretty violent like every action movie but i think it is acceptable .  thanks a lot louis liosa and tom berenger !  amazing film ! i advice everyone to see it . i am sure people wont regret and will really have a good time . 
this is the best movie i`ve ever seen  !  !  !  thomas beckett & richard miller -two mankinds who want to survive in the  " jungle "  of violence and madnes ,  one shot - one killed  !  !  ?  you must kill ,  if you getting doubt about something ,  you must survive  !  !   p . p . - i appologise of my bad / worst/ english  !  !  ! 
i am curious of what rifle beckett was using in the movie ,  and also the caliber of the bullet that he was suppose to be firing .  if this is loosely based on carlos hathcock's sniping ,  i am guessing that it is a 7mm .  round .  i am also curious of the rifle itself .  he also made a comment in the final sniper movie about the rifle that the vietnamese man let him use that belonged to his father .  beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made .  i would like to know which rifle that is also .  i know that this particular rifle was made around wwii or beforehand .  i just couldn't get a close enough look at it watching the movie to identify it .   as for mr .  hathcocks kills ,  his longest shot was 1 . 47 miles ,  and he had 93 confirmed kills and 14 unconfirmed kills .  after his wounds somewhat healed from being burned in vietnam ,  he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers in the usmc the skills that they would need in the field .  his sniping career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters that train in the usmc .  i found out his name from my friend who is a former marine .  any information would be great . 
this was another great tom berenger movie .  .  but some people are right it was like another sgt barnes character but it was still awsome .  .  tom berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of panama !  billy zane was a wuss at first just like cpl upham from saving private ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end !  sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it .  .  i remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick .  .  i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent ! 
as most off you might off seen star wars :  return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m|might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one  ( live tv )  when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi-wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader  ( real name :  anakin skywalker )  when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground
this is one military drama i like a lot !  tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett .  this marine is no-nonsense ,  in your face ,  and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done .  there you have billy zane (  " the phantom "  and others )  who plays richard miller ,  a former swat form d . c .  ,  works for the government and takes orders only from them .  who needs a bureaucrat ?  i don't !  when these two are paired ,  sparks should be flying .  and how .  however ,  beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works .  when the other sniper hits ,  it's wits vs .  wits ,  cat vs .  mouse ,  gunman vs .  gunman .  and when the seasoned sniper is caught ,  it's up to miller to put politics aside and save him .  who needs politics when you a pro like beckett ,  he took orders from no one but himself ,  plays by the rules and not the book ,  and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics .  the movie was a direct hit .  watch it .  rating 4 out of 5 stars . 
just as tom berenger put you into the soul of sgt .  barnes ,  he has done it again with thomas beckett .  if i thought his world was folding in on him in the first scenes ,  it was nothing compared to how much more i felt during the last scenes .  great movie ,  even for a girl . 
zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats .  i don't typically go for military/war movies ,  but this was worth my time .   it was serious ,  but it was also humorous .  beringer's character proved to be heroic and honest .  no matter what ,  you know that he's got your back .   zane's character developed throughout the film .  he wasn't just a suit ,  he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun .   the ending through me a little though .  it didn't really go with the action throughout the film ,  but i'm glad that i saw it ,  nonetheless .   it's worth checking out . 
there are few movies that appear to provide enterntainment as well as realism .  if you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern war ,  take a look at this one .    i just loved the scene where hundred soldiers get shooting at the jungle ,  no-one quite sure where that shot came ?   and ,  they nicked one scene to saving private ryan ,  so it has to have some merit in the scene .   
sunday would not be sunday without an action movie ,  and when you want intense combat ,  you turn to tom berenger  ( platoon )  .   here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords .  life's a bitch ,  so he gets a green office type  ( billy zane )  to help on the mission .   the film is in the hands of luis llosa ,  who stunk up anaconda .  he doesn't do much better here ,  but berenger makes the movie worthwhile .   sure ,  it may be a little long - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle ,  but is is good ,  tense action when the time is right . 
some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough .  well ,  if you regard it as an action movie ,  this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting .  however ,  i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one .   the movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences .  tomas beccket  ,  who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills ,  looked as if he was cold-hearted .  however ,  after beccket showed his day dream of montana ,  we can clearly see his softness inside .  it was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made beccket become so called cold-hearted .   millar ,  on the contrary ,  was a new comer ,  a green hand ,  and was even not qualified as a sniper .  billy zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to  " put a bullet through one's heart "  ( as what beccket said )  .  what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award .   these two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities .  these two snipers quarreled ,  suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other .   sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one . 
 " one shot ,  one kill ,  no exceptions .  "  a must see if you are into marines or snipers .  two big thumbs up !  great overall storyline ,  great camera work ,  good drama ,  action ,  details ,  and more .  pretty close to the real thing .  but this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults .  this is to sit back and have a good 99 mins .  the plot has some depth but this movie isn't really about making you think .  its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action .  sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie .  tom berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life .  the plain of dealing with all of the death .  must see for sniper fans . 
two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search for their targets ;  a slimy south american drug-lord and a prominent general .   moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere ,  sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller ,  taking it's time ,  establishing it's characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences .  director llosa isn't always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat ;  some detours here don't add up to much .  but this film is far better than his stallone/stone travesty the specialist .   billy zane ,  usually incredibly tiresome ,  does surprisingly well as the inexperienced sniper teamed up with veteran berenger .  as for berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget hollywood venture .  he can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he's very convincing here ,  reprising the role twice more in direct to dvd sequels . 
sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies .  i remember movies about vietnam or wwii ,  lots of firing ,  everybody dies ,  bam bam .   " sniper "  takes war to a new level or refinement .  the movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for - the helplessness of humans in the jungle ,  the hatred and eventual trust between beckett and miller ,  and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger .  a seemingly low-budget film makes up for every flaw with action ,  suspense ,  and thrill ,  because when it comes down to it ,  it's just one shot ,  one kill . 
this will be somewhat short .  first ,  don't listen to the critics ,  as it is not as bad as most say it is !  !  sniper uses a classic movie formula ,  which many dismiss immediately as flawing the movie .  while sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about how our country's military snipers work ,  it does give those who know nothing about the professional sniper a glimpse into the world of the sniper .  and yes ,  the movie has many flaws ,  but what movie doesn't ?  there are many good scenes and good acting by tom berenger .  i have to say the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with billy zane in the helicopter followed by zane in the marine's bar scene .  the best scene in sniper is with berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force sweeping it !  !  also there are plenty of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as though you are looking through a riflescope .  and yes ,  the sniper motto is `one shot ,  one kill' .  judge sniper for yourself !  !   
no ,  there is another  !   because every star wars fan had to have an opinion about i ,  ii & iii and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy ,  i will state the good points of  " the return of the jedi "  and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel .  of course ,  i loved the music ,  the special effects ,  the two droids ,  but this has been overly debated elsewhere .   what we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie  :  - a strong ecological concern - anti-militarist positions - fascinating insights about the jedi order and the force - cute creatures - harrison ford's smile - a killer scene  :  near the ending ,  when vader looks alternatively at his son and at the emperor .  the lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his black helmet .  and when he grabs and betrays his master to save luke ,  thereby risking his own life  !  oh ,  boy  !   what is wrong in the prequel inmho  :  - the whole  " human factor "  element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - the force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults ,  than about wisdom - too many jedis at once and too many light sabers on the screen - the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot   by the way ,  if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by obi web  ( obi wen ,  i mean )  and yoda ,  then you should read a few books about buddhism and the forms it took in ancient japan .   the magic of star wars ,  imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice ,  from a father to his son ,  albeit the difficulties .   " de mon âme à ton âme "  ,   ( from my soul to yours )  ,  as would write bejard to the late zen master t .  deshimaru . 
despite some negative comments this film has garnered in the imdb pages ,  it's still worth a look as this is a story about survival and camaraderie between two different men with different mentalities while in a difficult mission in the panamanian jungle .   peruvian director luis llosa takes us along to watch this thriller set in panama .  the film has some good moments as beckett ,  the veteran marine ,  takes a newly arrived man ,  recently sent to try to eliminate a notorious drug cartel head and the corrupt army general who might be the next president of the country .  the only problem ,  miller ,  has no experience in what he has been entrusted to achieve .   miller ,  the arrogant newly arrived man to the jungle and to the guerrilla warfare between the military and drug lords against the infiltrated american intelligence men ,  learns a valuable lesson from beckett .  what looks good in theory ,  is irrelevant in the jungle .   tom berenger ,  is an actor who doesn't register much ,  as he proves in this movie ,  but in the context of the movie ,  he is right as a man of a few words .  billy zane playing miller does what he can with a role that doesn't afford him any glory until the crucial end .   for lovers of action film ,   " sniper "  offers an 112 minutes of action that with a bit of trimming would have made a more satisfying movie . 
****spoilers**** the film  " sniper "  is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary us marine sniper carlos  " gunny "  hathcock .  the unassuming soft-spoken mister rogers look-alike who ran up a score of as much as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed vietcong and north vietnamese military kills during his two tours in  " nam "  . which shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really is .   tom berenger is cool clam and deadly as sgt . thomas beckett who's at the end of his career as a top us marine sniper but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a civilian will be pointless .  since there's nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the us marines unless he decides to become a mob hit-man .  backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country .   the story of the film  " sniper "  is focused on sgt . beckett with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver medalist and us government agent richard miller ,  billy zane ,  being sent deep inside the panamanian jungle .  the two snipers are to take out rebel general miguel alveraze ,  frederick miraglittoa ,  and colombian drug king-pin raul ochoa ,  carlos alveraze ,  who's supporting him in a planned a military take-over of the country .    we see earlier in the movie sgt .  beckett scope and take out a rebel leader which i feel was the best scene in  " sniper "  .  for it shows step by step how sgt .  beckett with the help of his spotter cpt .  papich ,  aden young ,  does his job .  there's also a sub-plot that was later aborted in the movie about a rebel sniper desilva ,  eward wiley ,  who was stalking beckett and who later killed papich as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter .  you would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but sgt .  beckett had no trouble at all in dispatching desilva early in the film by using an unsuspecting miller as bait .   what hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a rambo-like ending with sgt .  beckett and agent miller fighting off an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a london fog .    " sniper "  is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies :  a solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon and who does it in total secrecy . 
i've heard people who say this movie is dull dull dull .  i don't think they were watching the right movie .  this isn't the prototypical action movie ,  thank god .   this is a psychological drama about the rookie and his mentor that just happens to be about killing people .  in this way it works extremely well ,  with terrific performances from berenger and zane  ( who doesn't sleepwalk through the movie like he has in other roles - he actually looks like he's acting )  .   i was disappointed with the action towards the end - a lot of it didn't make much sense and was unsatisfying given the buildup from the rest of the movie .  but watch zane's face as he panics ,  alone ,  while berenger does the dirty work . 
firstly ,  this is simply the funniest movie i have ever seen .  it incorporates perfectly-timed slapstick ,  sexual humour ,  and cleverly-thought-up stand-up .  but it goes deeper than that .  the souler opposite is an original love story  ( something we don't see that often )  that gave me hope that there is love out there ; that two people who love each other can work through their adversity ;  and that such a comedic take on life  ( something i believe we all should have )  can be accepted by the people that really matter .  chris meloni gives a such a convincing performance as barry singer that he should have won an oscar .  the film is brilliantly written and i hope we will be seeing more films from everyone involved in the future . 
i finally got myself set up on mail order dvd rental so i could find movies not available to me in the stores .  i chose the souler opposite because i love christopher meloni ,  and also like small ,  often ignored films .   this one is such a treat !  meloni has such charm in this part .  it's easy to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego elliot stabler  ( losvu )  .  in this film ,  meloni is an out of step unattached mid-lifer who is hitting the skids in many ways ,  only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpected .   the relationship drawn between barry  ( meloni )  and tim busfield's character is realistic and not over done .  i haven't seen busfield since 30something ,  and he was fun to watch .  but it was all chris' film .  i became such a fan girl all over again .   it is a bit slow in the beginning ,  i will admit .  i thought some of the  " flashbacks "  could have been edited down .  but overall ,  this film will delight you - male or female - as it has an honest ,  refreshing view of relationships today . 
who knew they could be so funny ?  ?  christopher meloni and janel moloney are known more for their outstanding work in some of television's hottest dramas .   (  " law & order :  svu "  and  " the west wing "  )  put them together on the big screen and what you get is an engaging romantic comedy with plenty of laughs .   the actors develop the story's ongoing relationship with impressive skill ,  leaving the audience bound to fall in love with barry singer  ( meloni )  ,  despite the fact he's a standup comic who also happens to be a mean-spirited ,  sexist jerk .   you'll be rooting for him even as he takes all his insecurities with the opposite sex and chases thea  ( moloney )  halfway around the country in hopes of winning her heart .  they have so little in common .  .  . but when barry finally opens his heart ,  you'll wonder why thea keeps running away .   the souler opposite is a wonderful movie with an incredible cast and a gifted writer .  well worth your time .   
i happened upon this film by accident ,  and really enjoyed .  timothy busfield's character is without redeeming qualities ,  and at one point ,  busfield and star meloni ogle women as they pass by .  .  . meloni's take on the parade is different from busfield's .  janel maloney is terrific .  .  . she looks very much like tea leone ,  but the major difference here is that janel can actually act .  some very nice things in this film and well worth your attention when it's on cable . 
come on !  !  !  they did that on purpose !  !  two of my current faves on tv  ( meloni from  " oz "  and  " l and o-svu "  and janel from  " west wing "  )  hook up for a nice little sleeper/character study .  plot's nothing fancy ,  but the acting is right on the mark .  tim busfield shows up for some neat bits .  worth a look . 
overall i would have to say that i liked the movie .  some of the fight scenes are really good .  especially the fight against leung ka-yan .  one point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an asian to play a black man .  i mean really .  talk about bad taste .  during a fight scene ,  you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing .  otherwise ,  sammo copies bruce lee's fighting moves perfectly .  5 out of 10 stars . 
the most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again .  an early sammo film that has him imitating his character's hero ,  bruce lee ,  sammo is amazingly lee like in his actions and fighting .  the way he slips into bruce's style and then back to his own ,  more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is at his art .  throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all - comedy  ( some unintentional ,  like the fake black guy )  ,  action and some incredible fight scenes .   a great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time . 
 " one of hung's better early efforts .  the humor is dead-on in parts as hung tries to imitate lee's moves and facial expressions ,  and also in a bit where hung pokes fun at jackie chan's drunken master .  the action is also pretty good ,  especially when hung takes on a trio on martial arts experts at the end .  it's not the greatest film ,  but pretty good for '70's kung fu ,  especially if you're a fan of hung and/or lee .  be warned ,  though :  most video versions of the movie have pretty shoddy quality .  there is also a character in blackface which some people might find offensive .   sammo hung is a rural swine-herder who moves to hong kong to fight off some bad guys .  sammo turns on his dead-on bruce lee impersonation when fighting !    this film is often billed as a parody of bruce lee's  " enter the dragon "  ,  but it's not exactly that .  .  .  sammo is a rural swine herder--obsessed with bruce lee--who moves to hong kong to help his relatives run a small open-air restaurant .  once situated at the new job ,  he is forced to defend the eatery from local gangsters looking for protection money .  when sammo switches into fighting mode ,  he switches on his bruce lee impersonation ,  which must be seen to be believed !  this film is pretty sloppy ,  in many of the fight scenes sammo battles against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists ,  and there's one character who's supposed to be black who is played by an asian man in heavy  ( and preposterous )  makeup .  but what this film lacks in budget and accuracy ,  it more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy .  highly recommended for a good mood .  " 
this movie is not a kung fu movie .  this is a comedy about kung fu .  and if ,  before making this film ,  sammo hung hadn't spent some time watching films by the great french comic filmmaker jaques tati  ( i . ie .  ,  e . g .  ,  esp .  jour de fête )  ,  he is certainly on the same wave length .   personally ,  i think tati's films are hilarious ;  but they're not to all tastes .  some have told me that they loathe his work .  i've never figured out why ,  but i think it's because the character that tati usually plays himself is so totally dead pan ,  so unaffected by the events around him  ( which he is usually causing )  that many miss the more subtle comic bits happening around him .   at any rate ,  tati's main shtick - or at least his best known - is to take a pretentiously upright petite bourgeoisie with 19th century sensibilities and drop him into 20th century france where he must confront a society that is largely defined by the gradual eroding of those sensibilities .  he usually has serious difficulties with little things like record players or radios .  he's a hazard in a car ,  but the world's no safer when he rides a bicycle .  but through it all ,  he never loses his aplomb ,  which is derived from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the 20th overall .   in a similar fashion ,  the character sammo hung himself plays is a country boy come to the big city of hong kong ,  utterly convinced that what makes the city interesting is that bruce lee made kung fu movies there .  this gets him into trouble in small ways ,  since he takes in stride happenstance which would never be noticed in a small town but which are deemed inappropriate in a big city - such as the moment when he appears to be urinating in the street ,  a cop stops him ,  only to discover that hung is actually just squeezing water out of his shirt ,  soaked during an accidental dip in the bay .  what's interesting about this gag is why it is hung doesn't understand what the cop's fuss is all about - in a country town ,  as long as no one's looking ,  if you gotta go you gotta go .  in other words ,  hung is not really urinating in the street - but he certainly would - and what's the problem officer ?  of course hung's obsession with bruce lee also gets him into big troubles as well .  he beats a gang of thugs who have refused to pay his restaurant-owner uncle .  of course ,  in a bruce lee movie ,  the thugs would be considered trounced ,  and they would have learned their lesson .  but in hung's hong kong ,  reality unfortunately prevails ,  and the thugs return when he's not around ,  to trounce his uncle .   of course ,  hung finally triumphs in the end ,  just as tati always did .  characters like this must always triumph  ( at least in comedy )  because they are completely innocent ,  and as such ,  despite their comic missteps and misunderstandings ,  they really represent what is best in the humans we admire and wish to be .  we don't really want to be bruce lee  ( who has to experience the loss of all of his friends before he gets a chance to beat the bad-guy )  ,  we ,  in our own innocence ,  really want a world where lee's heroics are possible .   unfortunately ,  that world only exists on film .    " ah ,  but what if .  .  .  ?  "  - and in that question we find sammo hung at his comic best . 
this is of of sammo's great early comedy films .  this isn't a parody of enter the dragon ,  the main character  ( sammo )  is obsessed with bruce lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size .  nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble - then fighting .  oh ,  the fighting .  good ,  fast-paced scenes with high impact  ( the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of sammo's kicks )  .   the funniest bit of this movie was purely unintentional .  there is a jim kelly looking guy  ( one of three experts hired to take out sammo )  ,  but he was a chinese guy in blackface with an afro-wig .  come on ,  didn't they have any real black people in hong kong in 1978 ?  well ,  i guess i've seen enough white fake-as-hell  " chinese people "  in old american movies too .   this is one is for any sammo or bruce lee fan . 
 " enter the fat dragon "  is one of the funniest martial art movies i had the opportunity to see .  sammo hung portrays a chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend .  just like tang lung of  " way of the dragon .  "  wherever sammo goes ,  trouble starts ,  therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences .  luckily ,  sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol ,  bruce lee .  he even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way bruce lee does and also releases his screeching yell .  he also uses nunchucks in a scene .  it was like watching a fat bruce lee .  there's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters .  sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one .  sort of like  " the game of death "  ,  where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another .   this is one of the films i really enjoyed watching and also the very first sammo hung movies i've seen .  excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs .  a rare classic sammo hung film i highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there .  8 . 5/10 ! 
sometimes realism can work against the effectiveness of a film .  that's no problem here .  the sets are cheesy ,  inside and out .  the fog is ubiquitous ,  half disguising the shabbiness of the production .  if there's a bar ,  the name painted on the front window says simply ,   " wine and spirits .  "  the result is a claustrophobic set of scenes .  not a single shot of a city or even a fake skyline .  that's the kind of dublin this story is about ,  just as jack the ripper movies are about seedy ,  foggy ,  cobblestoned whitechapel .  who would want it any other way ?  how could it have been any other way with no bankable stars ,  a minuscule budget ,  and a four-week shooting schedule ?  the acting follows suit -- outrageously hammy on everyone's part .  sometimes ,  my god ,  it's positively excruciating .  mrs .  mcphillips moaning after frankie is shot dead outside the house .  victor mclaglin however delivers exactly the right kind of overdone performance .  wardrobe has stuffed him into a too-small jacket so that he seems to be bursting out of it like frankenstein's monster .  his every movement seems to go a little farther than it was intended to .  when he slaps his cap on his head ,  he bops himself on the temple .  a big ,  blustering ,  blubbering baby ,  he seems constantly drunk .  he betrays his best friend for the reward money which will take him and his would-be girl to america ,  not a good guy in the ordinary sense .  yet we wince as he begins to spend the 20 pounds ,  more and more of it during a wild ,  alcoholic night ,  because every expensive and grandiose gesture takes him farther from his dream .  i wouldn't argue it ,  but i can understand why he won an oscar .   as for max steiner's score ,  wow .  every movement ,  already overdone ,  is not only underlined by the mickey mouse music but highlighted in glossy yellow .  it shouldn't have happened -- the heavenly choirs ,  the endearing young charms ,  the minstrel boy ,  the gurgling tune while mclaglen drinks from the bottle .  it would have been better off with no score at all .   well ,  how is it as a whole ?  dated -- by any measure ,  but not a product of its times .  that's why i admire it .  yes ,  the symbolism is clumsy at times .  mclaglen ,  a real dummy ,  bumping his head against a hanging sign .  the fog .  the blind man .  but what impresses me is how little of this was being tried at the time .  what strikes us as overly arty today was in 1936 something quite different from what was seen in most of the programmers being ground out at the time .  if it falls short at times ,  it doesn't matter .  the movie was an act of courage ,  politically and morally as well as poetically .   ( the legion of decency condemned it because of a scene in a brothel .  )  a director's goal should exceed his grasp ,  or what's a script for ?  watching it now ,  however ,  in 2006 ,  the story is more disturbing than ever .  john ford obviously sympathized with the irish rebels .  they kill ,  but only out of what they see as necessity .   (  " he knows too much to live .  what if he goes to the tans ?  oh ,  it's not me-self i'm thinking of but all of us ,  of ireland herself .  "  )  the irish are sentimentalized and sympathetic .  i wonder if the jihadists in the middle east don't use a similar logic to justify their acts of violence . 
this picture in 1935 walked away with all kinds of ocars for best director ,  john ford ,  actor victor mclaglen and music by max seiner .  victor mclaglen ,  ( gypo nolan )  ,   " call out the marines "  , '42 ,  gave an outstanding performance as an irish rebel who belonged to a rough and tough crowd who were all fighting for a cause and at the same time getting poorer and poorer with plenty of drinking .  gypo nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend in order to take a trip with his gal to america and a new way of living .  preston foster ,   ( don gallagher )  ,  " guadalcanal diary "  , '43 ,  gave a great supporting role as the leader of the irish rebellion and was anxious to capture the informer of his group .  gypo nolan becomes haunted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel just like a judas .  great film for 1935 and wonderful acting by mclaglen ,  but rather depressing in every aspect of the film . 
in the mid-1930s hollywood was regaining its confidence after the difficulties of the talkie transition .  although all the technical problems of sound had been solved very quickly ,  it took longer to resolve the questions of how talking pictures should look ,  how they should be structured and how they should be acted .  the informer is a key picture in that it shows the extent to which wordless moments can convey story ,  asserting the power images without ignoring the necessities of sound and dialogue .   this is not to say the informer is truly a throwback to the golden days of the silents .  for one thing ,  many silent pictures were not so purely visual in their narrative ,  and were overburdened with title cards .  but what the informer has is the self-assuredness to extend moments between dialogues ,  to focus on reactions more than speeches ,  and to let shots play out simply for atmosphere .   director john ford ,  for all his capability ,  was a filmmaker who appears to have put in effort in proportion to how interested he was in the material .  if he thought a story was silly ,  he just did it half-arsed .  luckily the informer ,  with its depiction of community ,  honour ,  working class life and most importantly irish setting ,  was everything ford loved ,  and the result is one of his finest works .  in it ,  ford only really employs too kinds of shot .  the first is of places  the dublin streets shrouded in mist and darkness so their furthest depths cannot be seen ;  dingy interiors where the walls and ceilings seem to press in on us .  the second is of faces ,  striking close-ups against plain backgrounds ,  usually without dialogue ,  focusing us upon the inner conflicts of these people .   lead man victor mclaglen fits perfectly within this character and this manner of filming him .  mclaglen's performance does not look like much ,  being as it is about 90% drunk act .  but the other 10% is heartfelt emoting ,  as here and there his gypo nolan has what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity .  with such performances are oscars won .  mclaglen is backed by a spot-on supporting cast ,  among whom there are no weak links .  in particular it is nice to have donald meek and una o'connor ,  usually only seen in comic relief roles ,  playing straight dramatic parts for once  ( although meek's appearance does contain one or two jokes ,  the tone of the scene and much of his manner is serious )  .  not only do these two deliver incredibly deep performances ,  their familiarity to most viewers as comedy players gives an added note of poignancy to their part in this tragedy .   rko ,  who produced the informer ,  were perhaps the most adventurous and willing to take risks of all the major studios .  thanks to this ,  we are able to see a dismal story with a despicable anti-hero at its centre ,  which could easily have been a clunky ,  over-earnest mess ,  instead filled with a moody atmosphere and depth of character which keeps us watching and draws us into its world . 
like many people here ,  i started out finding my patience being tried by this film .  by the end ,  i actually shed a few tears .   it seems to be in the nature of most old films to drag for 7/8th length and then catch fire right at the end .  older film-goers learned to bide their time patiently through the slow parts ,  calm in the knowledge that the big payoff is on the way .  but that isn't quite accurate .  you see ,  to earlier audiences ,  what are to us the  " slow parts "  were the main body of the story .  they watched and found anecdotal and thematic interest there .  modern audiences ,  post-spielberg ,  are in a constant state of waiting to be hit with a small climax every two minutes when they see older films .  it's the inflation problem of modern movies .  well ,  that isn't going to happen .  it is not necessary to apologize for these films ;  it is simply that you have to adjust your expectations and personal rhythm when you watch them .  at this point ,  the difference between avatar and the informer is like the difference between euripides and a traveling production of rent .  think about it for a minute or two .  not to strain at the obvious ,  but euripides still deserves a hearing .   the  " exciting part "  ,  for most modern viewers ,  begins with the ira tribunal scene and escalates to the final couple of minutes ,  which ,  if you are at all on board or even paying attention by that time ,  will tear your heart out .  it's not some high-tone universal abstract plea for forgiveness ;  it's a plea from one dimwit ,  and those who feel sorry for the big lummox ,  for a little mercy .  it's that personal ,  and that embarrassingly naked an appeal .  for after being mad at gypo ,  irritated at him ,  thinking this is the dumbest character of all time ,  you finally find yourself won over by the scene of gypo's erstwhile girlfriend pleading to another woman to talk her man into going easy him .    the film may be sentimental ,  but the sentimentality is not cheap as some here have charged .  there's a matter of life and death that plays out here ,  and as long as you take the proposition of one life to a customer seriously ,  it's sentimentality wrung out of the most serious stuff .   8 of 10 .  and the fault for it not being 10 of 10 is my own and in some measure yours ,  if you are reading this .  we have all asked for more ,  ever more ,  faster ,  ever faster until we cannot put ourselves in 1935 -- just yesterday ,  really -- as easily as we should be able . 
i just saw this film on turner classic movies last night and was blown away by victor mclaglen's performance : in every sense of the word a  " tour de force "  .  the atmosphere of 1922 dublin evoked through the cinematography and production design really foreshadowed techniques used in the best film noirs of the 40's and early 50's . very nice attention to detail also ; during frankie mcphillip's  ( wallace ford's )  wake ,  the mourners are all praying in gaelic .  max steiner's score is unforgettable .  as in later films such as 1939's gwtw ,  he appropriated folk ballads to lend local color and a sense of place and time .  john ford :  already a film giant in 1935 ! 
 " return of the jedi "  is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right ,  and that is a shame ,  because the last chronological installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling .  it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale ,  and does so very convincingly .   yes ,  there are ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit .  but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga ,  where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader ,  the most recognizable villain in movie history .   return of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook :  it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline  ( which went from slightly implausible in the  " empire strikes back "  to very convincing here )  ,  an exciting opening at jabba's palace ,  a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor ,  luke finally coming into his own ,  the resolution of solo and leia's romance ,  and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moon .   yes ,  there are slight annoyances .  but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene .  it's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter .  it's not a 'good' movie - it's fantastic ! 
****spoilers**** powerhouse movie that shows how men in desperate situations can go so far as sacrifice their best friends and family members and not realize what monsters that they are by doing it .  until like in the case of bull-like gypo noland ,  victor mclaglen ,  it's too much too late .   it's 1922 and the hight of the black & tan irish revolt against the mighty british empire with the tans ,  british occupying troops ,  on the lookout for wanted irish republican rebel frankie mcphillip ,  wallace ford ,  wanted for the killing of a briish soldier .  gypo a good ,  really the best ,  friend of the fugitive mcphillip is down on his luck not having a job with his girlfriend katie ,  margot grahame ,  forced to turn tricks in the dublin red-light district in order to pay her rent .   after an outraged gypo worked over a potential john who want's to spend a few hours with katie ,  for a shilling or two ,  an angry katie tells the not so bright gyro that he's preventing her for supporting herself with the only bankable asset she has  ,  her body .  katie also tells gypo that he should wake up to reality and realize what a desperate situation that she's in .  telling the mind-numbed gypo that it would only cost ten pound sterling for her to go to america ,  and get out of the poverty of ireland ,  gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend frankie mcphillip that he just saw announcing a reward of 20 pound sterling .  thats enough money for both him and kaite to travel to america .   gypo going to a local dublin flop house and soup kitchen to get a free meal is startled to run into his friend frankie mcphillip .  frankie tells him that he snuck into dublin to see both his mother mrs .  mcphillip and sister mary ,  una o'connor & heather angel ,  and if he can make sure that everything is safe for him to go home and later leave for his irish republican unit outside the city .   all gypo can see in frankie's face is the 20 pound sterling reward for him being turned into the police !  without as much of a second thought ,  after he assured frankie that everything is all right ,  gypo secretly goes to the police and informs on his friend who's later shot and killed in a police and tan shootout in his moms house .   with the deed done the chief of police hands over the 20 pound sterling ,  much like thirty pieces of silver ,  to an almost emotionless gypo who takes it and sneaks out the back door of the police station so that one one can see him .  you can see in the police chief's face and actions that he has nothing but utter contempt for gypo's betrayal of his friend frankie mcphillip .  even though he was wanted for murder and an enemy of the british empire .  that's how low traitors or informers are held even by those whom they secretly work for .   gypo turns out to be his own worst enemy after his betrayal of frankie as his conscience takes control of his mind .  gypo sees and hears everyone ,  including his unsuspecting girlfriend katie ,  pointing a finger and implicating him in frankie's betrayal and death at the hands of the british authorities .  gypo's guilty mind has him getting himself royally and gloriously drunk ,  on the reward money ,  that by the time he's forced to to admit his crime to his irish republican army colleagues ,  who had the almost dead drunk and slobbering gypo on trial ,  the money was just about gone in his partying drinking and whoring .   whatever good feelings ,  if that's possible ,  that you had for the weak minded and strong shouldered gypo was completely demolished when in an act of total desperation ,  in order to keep from getting shot ,  he falsely implicate an innocent man mulligan ,  donald meek ,  in his crime of informing on his friend frankie mcphillip .  which is quickly exposed as a total fabrication by non other then the guilt-ridden gypo himself .  the dye is then cast as straws are drawn for who would be the one to put a bullet in gypo's head for the final gut spilling chapter of this heart wrenching and unforgettable crime & punishment classic .

victor mclaglen's performance is one of the finest in film history .   i think we can all feel for  " gypo "  because we've all struggled with what is right and what isn't and been wrong .  this was one of the first art-house pictures to be released by a major american movie studio  ( rko radio pictures )  .   joseph h .  august's cinematography is at its very best here .  however ,  august's stunning portion was mostly overlooked ;  he didn't receive the oscar nomination he rightly deserved .   this is a psychological drama ,  with thought ,  philosophy ,  sadness ,  all conveyed with as little words as possible . 
yet again ,  early morning television proves an invaluable resource for films that i otherwise would never have been able to track down .  at four o'clock in the morning ,  i stumbled out of bed to begin recording 'the informer  ( 1935 )  , ' my fourth film from prolific american director john ford ,  and an excellent one at that .  set during the irish civil war in 1922 ,  the screenplay was adapted by dudley nichols from the novel of the same name by liam o'flaherty .  though he was born in the united states ,  and is most renowned for his  " americana "  pictures ,  both of ford's parents were irish ,  which explains the director's decision to direct the film .  victor mclaglen plays gypo nolan ,  a brutish but well-meaning ruffian who informs on an old friend ,  frankie mcphillip  ( wallace ford )  ,  in order to claim the £20 reward for his girlfriend ,  katie  ( margot grahame )  .  when frankie is killed during his attempted arrest ,  the irish republican army ,  of which both frankie and gypo were members ,  begins to investigate the traitor behind the incident ,  every clue bringing them closer and closer to the real culprit .   meanwhile ,  gypo is plagued with guilt for his friend's untimely death ,  and descends into a bout of heavy-drinking that rivals don birnam in 'the lost weekend  ( 1945 ) ' in its excessiveness .  as gypo drowns his sorrows in copious volumes of alcohol ,  trapped in a vicious little circle of depression ,  his extravagant spending captures the attention of the investigating ira members .  for the one time in his life ,  gypo finds himself surrounded by admirers  ( including an amusing j . m .  kerrigan )  ,  who enthusiastically clap him on the back and christen him  " king gypo "  for his physical might .  however ,  it's obvious that these people feel no affection for the man ,  and are simple showing him attention to exploit him for money .  the additional £20 brought by frankie's death could never buy gypo an assembly of friends  indeed ,  in a bitter twist of irony ,  the money was only made possible by the betrayal and loss of one of his only good companions .  a relatively simple fellow ,  gypo could not possibly have fully considered the consequences of his actions ,  and is eventually offered forgiveness on account of his  " not knowing what he was doing ,  "  but his foolishness must not go unpunished .   criticism is occasionally levelled at ford's film for its allegedly propagandistic support of a  " terrorist "  organisation .  though this stance obviously depends on one's personal views {i certainly don't know enough irish history to pass judgement} ,  there's no doubt that the film portrays the irish republican army as selfless ,  dedicated and impartial ,  a proud piece of irish patriotism if i ever saw it .  however ,  the main theme of the story is that of betrayal ;  driven by intense poverty ,  one ordinary man betrays the confidence of his good friend ,  and comes to deeply regret his actions .  the tormented gypo is played mainly for pity ,  and victor mclaglen gives a powerful performance that betrays a lifetime of unsatisfying existence ,  culminating in one terrible decision that condemns him to an uneasy death .  'the informer' was john ford's first major oscar success ,  winning a total of four awards  ( from six nominations )  ,  including best actor for mclaglen {who snatched the statue from the three-way favourites of 'mutiny on the bounty  ( 1935 ) '} ,  best director and best screenplay for dudley nichols {who declined the award due to union disagreements} . 
this amazing oscar winner  ( 4 in total )  and john ford's first academy award winner ,  is simply spellbinding with a pounding score by max steiner .  called an art film ,  because ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and retribution ,  and greed and stupidity .  but what makes this movie such a classic ,  is the direction and astounding photography and use of fog and lighting ,  that was so different from the usual american film ,  and more in the tradition of german expressionism .  and the oscar winning performance by victor mclaglen as the drunken gypo is simply unbelievable .  basically the movie takes place in ireland ,  and gypo turns in a friend in the rebel movement to the english to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend .  but having all that money ,  he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away ,  while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer .  the whole movie is one night in a dark and foggy ireland ,  and a cast of characters that are memorable but all along ,  the whole world of gypo is closing in on him ,  both psychologically .  if i had to pick maybe three directors to have all their movies on a deserted island forever ,  and nobody elses ,  john ford would certainly be one of them .  what a truly remarkable movie .  .  . 
john ford is one of the most influential and best remembered american filmmakers in the history of film ,  his name usually associated with the western film genre .  however ,  john ford's arguably best film is not a western at all but a seedy drama set in the irish fight for independence in the early 1920s :  1935's the informer .   times are tough on many in ireland and the burnt out gypo nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation - and the walls are closing in .  gypo is big but he is not the brightest bulb on the tree ,  has a warm heart but a short fuse ,  and never seems to really think things all the way through but he is not a criminal or a self-centered pig .  walking the streets starving with no where to live ,  the hulking gypo nolan finds the prime lady in his life ,  katie madden ,  on the streets soliciting herself because of her own desperate situation and starts to dream about taking her to the united states if he only had the 20 pounds to pay for it .  as luck would have it ,  his friend frankie is back in town with a 20 pound price over his head and gypo is desperate enough to inform the police of frankie's whereabouts .  gypo ,  with the new 20 pounds of blood money earned ,  finds this foggy night particularly foggier as guilt swells all over him and the ira invests all their resources to find frankie's informer .   victor mclaglen portrays the fallen gypo nolan and definitely deserved the best actor oscar he was awarded for this film .  his brutish ,  stupid ,  and tender turns give the character dimension and mclaglen is only second to dudley moore's character arthur bach from the 1981 film arthur as the most entertaining cinematic drunk .  margot grahame's performance as katie madden is also excellent but she and mclaglen are the only members of the cast who truly impress .  preston foster is especially miscast as an ira head ,  mainly because he is most obviously not irish ,  and j .  m .  kerrigan borders on irritating throughout his role in the film but this disappointing supporting cast is the film's only poor point .   often overshadowed by some of ford's better known westerns like the searchers or the man who shot liberty valance ,  the informer is easily one of john ford's best films - if not his very best .  beginning what would be a long career of oscar nominations and wins for john ford ,  the informer won four oscars including one for him for best director in 1936 .  ford and company's use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and vital to telling the story .  gypo's walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring accusations of the street lamps ,  each shadow constantly reminding him of his dark deed .  ford's command of this technique was amazing to watch ;  if the informer was made 10 years later  ( thus making the genre requirements )  it would probably be considered one of the best films noir of all time but that does not hinder it from being remembered as an excellent classic film . 
maybe it's because i looked up the history of the irish troubles in the 1920s and then the sad civil war that engulfed the free state after the signing of the treaty before watching this movie .  anyway ,  the sudden turn at the end brought tears to my eyes .   victor mclaglen isn't as famous today as he was back then ,  and he should be better remembered .  in this film ,  i think he's playing himself as he would have been without his innate talent and brains .  for example ,  the scenes where his buddy in the crowd is challenging men to fight with him is probably quite reminiscent of what mclaglen actually did in earlier years ,  when he was a world-class bare-knuckles boxer .  john ford is partly responsible for that ;  the imdb trivia section shows how he tricked mclaglen into getting a really bad hangover for the trial scene .  this director also could bring out a lot in his actors ,  even without such tricks .  mostly ,  though ,  mclaglen is firmly in control ,  especially when his character is almost totally blotto  ( which is difficult for an actor to do believably )  ,  and he also plays gypo nolan with a depth and emotional power that is surprising for someone who has only seen mclaglen later in his career ,  in  " the quiet man .  "  i especially like the contrast between this role as an ira man and the much more obviously controlled performance he gave as the ira man denis hogan in  " hangman's house .  "    in  " the quiet man ,  "  of course ,  mclaglen is a country squire at odds with the local ira .  victor mclaglen was big and bully ,  in the old-fashioned sense of the word ,  but he was a good actor ,  too ,  and capable of wide range and fine nuances of performance that we just wouldn't expect of a such a man today .  it's a rather sad comment on our own set of expectations and prejudices .   ford ,  as usual ,  packs a lot into a little bit of film .  all the characters are excellent  ( though the commandant's mostly american accent is distracting )  -- note :  there be spoilers ahead !  -- knowing that gypo once drew the short straw and was ordered to kill a man but let him talk his way out of it instead ,  we really empathize with the man who draws the short straw for executing gypo ,  and the humanity he shows ,  most notably when they go to take gypo in mary's room .    john ford really shows his genius here ,  taking what could have been a gruesome and yet expected outcome to the whole story and instead using it to set up a totally unexpected and yet very satisfying ending that makes us think not just of gypo and the other characters ,  but of poor ireland during that tortured time . 
one of john ford's best films 'the informer' doesn't feature any grand scenery of the american west .  instead the intense drama ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged terrain of british character actor victor mclaglen's face .  the former prizefighter ,  who once faced joe louis in the ring ,  delivers an academy award-winning portrayal of disgraced ira soldier gypo nolan on the worst night of his life .   the plot is gracefully simple :  in 1922 dublin ,  a starving and humiliated man who's been thrown out of the ira for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood ,  himself becomes an informant .  for £20 he betrays a friend to  " the tans "  and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt ,  denial ,  self-pity ,  and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions .    it is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple gypo that is the film's most impressive achievement .  in most movies a burly lout of gypo's type would be cast as the heavy ,  he'd have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown .  in 'the informer' gypo himself is both hero and villain ,  while the showdown is in his inner turmoil ,  every bit of which is explicitly shared with the audience .   because liam o'flaherty's novel had previously been filmed in 1929 ,  rko gave ford a very modest budget .  the director and his associates ,  particularly cinematographer joseph h .  august ,  turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself .  in addition to mclaglen's oscar 'the informer' also won john ford his first along with wins for best screenplay and best score . 
today if someone mentions the name victor mclaglen the response most likely will be  " who ?  "  or perhaps  " why ?  "  well ,  believe it or not ,  victor mclaglen won the academy award for best actor in this film ,  which is about a poor ,  desperate man who is willing to sell out his best friend for  " carfare "  to the united states .  it's an interesting movie which shows how low even the most well-meaning shnooks will go just for a few bucks .  the movie takes place in british-dominated ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of ireland ,  all mr .  mclaglen's character is concerned about is getting money and getting drunk .  the movie makes one wonder whether political activism is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point ,  many others not only do not care ,  they don't even know what the fuss is all about .  the morale of this movie is :  look out for the friend ,  he may sell you out for a dime . 
to watch this film from start to finish without bursting into laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith ,  as one has to keep saying to oneself ,   " it's old "  ,   " it's a classic "  ,   " be kind "  ,  not because the movie is so bad ,  but because at its best it's so good .  this is one dated movie .  it's also a classic ,  if a tarnished one .  i'm not inclined to laugh at people anyway ,  on principle ,  and i get more than a little irritated when others do so .  to make fun of the informer to my mind is a little like giggling at an idiot savant when he dribbles his orange juice all over the tablecloth .  yes ,  one says to oneself ,  he is an idiot ,  and yet when he's on top of his game he is also a true savant .  the same is true for the informer ,  which is on occasion very dreadful indeed ,  and yet it boasts splendid photography ,  some fine acting ,  a wonderful score and a good ,  decent simple story .  in the end ,  which i won't give away ,  politics ,  religion and psychology come together ,  in a church ,  in such a way as to make the scene seem corny and over the top ,  and yet so is life sometimes .  uneducated people of simple faith behave differently from us  ( presumably brilliant )  modern folks ,  and the scene isn't so much unbelievable  ( i buy it ,  but i know the irish )  as embarrassing .  yet people do behave that way ,  they do say things like that .  not everyone is hip ,  and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be hip .  are people today so much superior to those of seventy or eighty years ago ?  and in what way ?  i don't think so .  we're just different .  now go watch the movie . 
victor mclaglen ,  the title character of john ford's the informer ,  reminded me of the circus man from fellini's la strada .  anthony quinn played the brutish man ,  who may have even been influenced by the pug-faced ,  oscar-winning performance given by mclaglen .  poverty-stricken dublin is the true-life ,  atmospheric setting of the picture ,  which takes place in 1922 .  dense fog and a long damp night are the main elements of a story about deep irish patriotism and the fight of the irish republican army .  the conflict of individuality and the cause is what makes the informer tick .  mclaglen's large ,  simple character just wants to go to america and we're reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently .  two different signs become the psychological centerpiece for the drunken irishman .  one is the previous ,  the other a wanted sign .  should he do it and get the money to go ?   john ford once famously said ,   " my name is ford .  i make westerns .  "  after seeing this film ,  he obviously could do a heck of a lot more .  the serious social issues dealt with here are heartfelt and ones you will find yourself thinking about .  and the look of the piece is amazing ,  consisting of long dark shadows cutting into a miserable ireland night .  ford was always known for his luminescent ,  gorgeous cinematography that helped to foresee the conflicts within his characters .  this is hard in color ,  but he did it in pictures like the searchers ,  painting john wayne in a sometimes vicious manner .  victor mclaglen's performance not only benefits from the lighting ,  but by the sheer simplicity of his acting .  he shoves a lot .  he knocks people out .  he is a brute who knows no better .  he should ,  however ,  know whether or not to cross the ira .   see the film to find out the gritty details .  see it also for mclaglen and ford's patriotic portrayal of the ira .  max steiner's score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters ,  placing more emphasis on them .  this was usually only seen in silent films ,  especially chaplin .  the topic of naming names or  " informing "  is obviously still important .  just look at how the media covered this year's oscars ,  giving much attention to the elia kazan scandal . 
i don't doubt that victor mclaglen won his best actor oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the mutiny on the bounty leads of clark gable ,  charles laughton ,  and franchot tone who were all in the same race .  but the informer is still a fine film because john ford wouldn't have gotten his first best director oscar if it wasn't .  no split involved in his award .   the movie and the story by liam o'flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named gypo nolan who was once a member of the irish republican army .  he was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in .  he's down to his last pence and if he can't get back in ,  wants enough for passage to america .  there's a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named frankie mcphillip played by wallace ford .  in a moment of weakness he goes to the black and tan constabulary and informs on mcphillip .   the ira is pretty anxious to find out who ratted mcphillip out and they're pretty certain it was mclaglen .  he hasn't the wit to really cover his own tracks .  he does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named peter mulligan played by donald meek .  he also picks up a hanger-on played by j . m .  kerrigan .   the whole action of the informer takes place in 1922 in dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning .  of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows ,  making it possibly the first noir thriller .  had it been done post world war ii the informer would have ranked as a great noir classic ,  like odd man out or the the third man which it bares a lot of resemblance to .   john ford knew this world very well .  he took some time off during the rebellion and was in ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the ira .  his real name before having it anglicized was sean o'fiernan .   preston foster plays the ira commandant dan gallagher .  in the book gallagher is a harder and meaner man than foster has him here .  my guess is that john ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest .  he makes it clear that foster has to eliminate the informer because the black and tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril .   the ira trial scene is the highlight of the film .  when foster asks donald meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court ,  meek ain't in a position to say no .  the king's justice and writ does not run here .  it graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary ,  the british are indeed losing their grip on the population .   of course the informer a rather grim story has its john ford touches ,  but rather fewer than you would expect .  even as mclaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree ,  the ira is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing .   the informer is a tale well told about ireland in a grim and dismal time . 
dear readers ,   the final battle between the rebellion and empire .  the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance .  luke skywalker ,  now a jedi knight ,  returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia ,  now revealed as luke's twin sister !  they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star .  little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death star .   return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy .  it's got action ,  drama ,  romance ,  great battles ,  fantastic acting ,  amazing fight scenes ,  and awesome music by john williams .  mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight ,  gone is the naive farm-boy and in his place is a calm ,  relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy .  leia is still cool in this film as well as han and lando .  3p0 ,  r2 ,  and chewie do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is cinema's greatest villain :  darth vader .  ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine .  the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty .  john williams's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels .   signed ,  the constant dvd collector
this film deals with the irish rebellion in the 1920s and more specifically one man's life after he informs on a friend for the bounty on his head and the subsequent consequences .  watching the film ,  i got the feeling that you could take the script and with just some minor updates ,  do it again and it ,  sadly ,  would still fit contemporary events .  but te remake wouldn't be nearly as good .  a magnificent performance by victor mclaglen  ( for which he deservedly got an oscar )  and a fine ensemble cast that includes most ,  if not all the actors with brogues in hollywood at the time ,  most of them recognizable character actors either established at the time or just starting out .  a very good film well worth watching .  highly recommended . 
magnificent and unforgettable ,  stunningly atmospheric ,  and brilliantly acted by all .   i really cannot understand what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8  ( and nine ones !  )   this ,  along with grapes of wrath ,  is john ford's greatest movie .  i would say that long voyage home is next in line ,  though quite a way back .   rating :  10 .  it deserves a 12 . 
a brilliant portrait of a traitor  ( victor mclaglen in oscar winning performance )  who is hounded by his own conscience .  mclaglen plays an ira rouge who betrays his leader to collect a reward during ireland's sinn fein rebellion .  the scenes showing fights and mob actions are very realistic ,  focusing on the desperation within individuals .  the lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death .   director john ford superbly creates an murky and tense atmosphere ,  enhanced by the foggy and grimy depiction of the irish landscape .  max steiner's dramatic music score adds to the cinematic delight .  oscar winner also for best screenplay ,  nominated for best picture .  this is one of hollywood's classic . 
gypo nolan  ( victor mclaglen )  is as poor as anyone on earth .  living in 1920s ireland ,  gypo and his fellow irishmen are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive brits .  one particular rebel ,  wanted for murder by the english ,  arrives back into town secretly .  he thinks he can trust his friend gypo ,  but the £20 reward proves too tempting .  gypo gets his friend killed and sinks into a pit of despair and drunkenness .  meanwhile ,  the other irish rebels are searching for the informer .  right away ,  gypo ,  with money burning a hole in his pocket ,  is their main suspect ,  but they ,  who are his friends ,  don't want to believe it .  the story of the informer is simple in its plot ,  but complex in its moral and emotional issues .  it's easily one of john ford's most emotionally involving films .  what gypo did was wrong ,  but we can certainly understand his motives .  we also understand his sorry character ,  and there's a lot of sympathy that arises for him .  the script is very suspenseful ,  as well .  it's the kind of suspense where we are pretty sure we know how everything will end up ,  so we have to grit our teeth and bear along with it .  the acting is remarkable .  victor mclaglen ,  who acted in many of ford's films ,  probably gave his best performance here  ( and won an oscar for it )  .  every other performer in the film deserves his or her kudos .  in addition to an amazing script and acting ,  the informer is one of john ford's most expressionistic films .  i love the darker side of ford .  in its mood ,  as well as in its themes ,  the informer reminds me of two of my other favorite ford films ,  the long voyage home  ( 1940 )  and the fugitive  ( 1948 )  ;  it's also a bit similar to the grapes of wrath  ( 1940 )  in these respects .  10/10 . 
i have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say .  even though this movie did not get the best comments ,  this movie made my day .  it got me thinking .  what a false world this is .   what do you do when your most loved ones deceive you .  it's said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake ,  it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance .  same way some people are such that they are never grateful .  this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself .    a brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster .  the surviving brother decides to take revenge .  through this process ,  we learn about the futility of this world .  nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone .   amitabh gave the performance of his life .  the new actor aryan gave a good performance .  the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show .  her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance .  chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself .   a great movie by raj kumar santoshi .  his movies always give some message to the audience .  his movies are like novels of nanak singh  ( a punjabi novelist who's novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil )  because they have a real message for the audience .  they are entertaining as well as lesson-giving . 
family is about two families who are after each other's blood .   viren sahay  ( amitabh bachchan )  is an underworld don ,  operates from bangkok .  he has a family in india .  once by mistake he kills shekhar  ( akshay kumar )  .  like viren sahay ,  he also has a family  ( a brother ,  wife and parents )  .  aryan  ( aryaman )  ,  shekhar's brother is out to take revenge of his brother's death .  he kidnaps viren sahay's family for the same reason .   the film has got one turning point  ( amitabh bachchan )  .  second half of the movie belongs to him completely where instead of his dialogs ,  expression matters more .  akshay's minuscule role has also put him at par with amitabh .  i didn't understand what bhumika chawala was doing in this movie .   there were a few loose points in the script ;  like ;  amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot-free in the city .  kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague .  how can the family of such a big don doesn't have any security cover ? 
a movie made for contemporary audience .  the masses get to see what they want to see .  action ,  comedy ,  drama and of course sensuous scenes as well .  this is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with entire family .  it isn't for eyes of children .  i had to fast forward quite a number of scenes .   if it is just entertainment you are looking for ,  then this movie has it all .  the songs are catchy .  a lavish production ,  i must add .   however ,  the message of the movie is not universal .  it emphasizes on the idea of karma .  that is ,  if you do good ,  you will get good .  and if you do evil ,  you will get evil .  the fruit of good deeds is good ,  while the fruit of evil is evil .    in real life ,  this is not always true .  it is well-known that most people do not get justice in this world .  while it is true that some evil people do meet with an evil end ,  there are many who escape .  and then ,  there are many people who do good ,  and yet in return they meet with a sorry end .   if you don't care about the message ,  and all you want is an escape from worldly reality ,  this movie is an entertainer alright . 
even though this was a disaster in the box office ,  it is my favorite film .  it gives a powerful message of family .  it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis .  compared to other bollywood films ,  the action scenes in this movie are more realistic .  it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan .  if you want to see the indian godfather ,  amitabh portrays that in this film .  don't read reviews by critic ,  they're just ignorant .  this movie has good mix of comedy ,  romance ,  drama ,  and especially action .  so if you want to see action more realistic than main hoon na ( still good movie )  ,  this is the movie . 
not many reviews ,  hence thought i would add one .   do not go by the other reviews !  this was a excellent movie .   rks is one of the very few indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie .   ab and akshay given yet another example of great acting ,  as does bhoomika too ,  which was a little unexpected ,  but great to watch .   am surprised there has not been much hype around release .   or filmfare/other awards nominations ,  considering how good the movie was .   better then khakee i thought and i thought khakkee too was good movie .   is a fairly long movie ,  but definitely worth it and while watching it ,  definitely does seem long .   cant wait for rks next movie and the next ab ,  akshay movie they always seem to do well together .  .  .  e . g .  waqt .   bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future . 
well ,  i get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that don't reflect my experience at all .  to me ,  amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies .  he was a die-hard villain ,  a no-apologies villain .  to me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isn't sort of undercut in some way .   the kid who played aryan was probably over his head with this cast .  there i think maybe the director could have done better .  but ,  to be honest ,  the very best part of this movie was shernaz patel .  she is an unsung heroine ,  a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered .  but i must say i appreciated her contribution greatly as she played virendra sahi's wife .  she may be given little to do ,  but she does everything with total conviction .  i'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience .   so if you are in a habit for settling for bollywood average ,  you won't get much out of this movie .  but if you constantly search for something more ,  then this might give you some of what you've been missing . 
brilliant movie .  the drawings were just amazing .  too bad it ended before it begun .  i´ve waited 21 years for a sequel ,  but nooooo !  !  ! 
it's been quite some time since i've watched this lotr .  i am currently hunting for a copy to purchase .  bakshi's work is quite true to the original work .  the visuals are engrosing and sometimes haunting .   drawbacks ?  occasionally ,  the movie is confusing or muddled .  there are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl .  but ,  overall -- buy this movie .  it's great for kids ,  adults and collectors . 
if you have read the books then forget the characters that tolkien built in your head .  the representation of hobbits ,  dwarves etc have had the 'disney' treatment .  the dark riders are excellent ,  and as i had always imagined from the books .   cinematically this is an excellent film ,  mixing live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year .  i only wish he  ( bakshi )  had been given the money to complete his epic .   it's worth having the video as they will be worth a bit after the 2001 lord of the rings  !  ! 
  i just bought this movie on dvd and watched it for the first time the other night .  i've been a fan of tolkien's work for about 4 years now ,  ever since i got out of high school .  i didn't grow up on this movie .  .  . perhaps my mother kept me away from it .  it's definitely not for children .  not that it's bad in a graphic sense ,  but that the themes would go right over most 10 year olds heads .  overall ,  the animation was excellent considering this was made in 1978/1979 .  i thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense .  but i am bothered that bashki didn't just add another 40 minutes or so and tack on the return of the king parts .  that would've made it the ultimate movie .  i was bothered by it's abrupt end ,  and then when i heard return of the king sucked ,  i was bothered even more .  too bad it wasn't one great animation film .  it might have garnered a higher vote from me .  i give it a 7 .  i can only hope peter jackson will do the books justice with the new live action lotr . 
one thing i can say about this movie is well long ,  very long !  i actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out .  i was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because the 70's  ( even though i never lived in them )  is actually one of my favourite decades ,  especially for the music !  when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive .  i will admitt the animation did impress me !  it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see .  but the movie honestly could of been a bit better ,  it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting .  then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly .  in my opinion i thought it was extremely long .  i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie ,  it made it seem like it was 4 hours long !  !  !  !  but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those  " nothing to do days "  .  i will see the new one and i hope it is better ! 
i recently rented the animated version of the lord of the rings on video after seeing the fantastic 2001 live action version of the film .  the lord of the rings live action trilogy directed by peter jackson will undoubtably be far better than george lucas' star wars  " prequel "  trilogy  ( episodes 1-3 )  will ever be as the real fantasy film series of the 21st century !   i remember seeing the animated version as a child ,  and i didn't quite understand the depth of the film at that time .  now that i have read the books ,  i understand what the whole storyline is all about .  to be sure ,  some of the characters are quite silly ,   ( samwise gangee is particularly annoying ,  almost as much as jar jar binks in star wars episode one ,   ( awful !  )  )  but ,  i have to say it follows the book rather closely ,  and it goes into part of book two ,  the two towers .  the good things are that the action is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for it's time .  the bad things are that it ends upruptly halfway through the two towers without any result of frodo's quest to destroy the one ring ,  and the animation looks quite dated compared to today's standards .    overall ,  not as bad as many say it is .  but ,  the 2001 live action version is the new hallmark of the lord of the rings !  at least ralph bakshi took the script seriously !  peter jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books ,  which in turn caused him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film ,  so we can at least thank ralph bakshi for that matter !  i'll take the animated version of lord of the rings over the live version of harry potter anyday !   a 7 out of a scale of 1-10 ,  far less violent than the 2001 live action version ,  but nowhere near as good !  for diehard fans of the books and film versions of the lord of the rings . 
there seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net .  those who hate it and curse ralph bakshis name and those love it and call it work of genious .  i'm inclined to be in the middle .  i'am forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film  ( e . g . the cruel cutting of the story ,  badly rotoscoped charecters ,  over acting etc .  .  .  )  but dispite this i still love this film .  the rotoscoping  ( when done properly ) adds an eerie lifelike dimension to the charecters and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic .  the surrealistic scenes when the nineriders chase frodo are stylish and well executed and the musical score .  .  .  magic .  sadly the bad points outweight film but if you can bring yourself to ignore them it is a great film .    ( no doubt i'll be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this film after writing this review ,  ah well ,  such is life ) 
i remember watching this late at night on black and white tv ,  long before a live-action version was so much as a twinkle in peter jackson's eye .  .  .  and being very impressed .  finally getting my hands this week on a vhs copy that was being thrown away  ( and isn't that just par for the course .  .  ?  )  i had the chance to revisit this film ,  and found that it still stands up quite well ,  although it's not quite the success that memory had painted .   i have to confess to a certain bias here .  some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed jackson-lovers ,  others as jackson-haters ;  i'm not exactly either .  i was a devotee of the bbc radio adaptation by brian sibley originally broadcast in 1981 ,  and instantly recognised the voice of gollum here -- peter woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost note-perfect for the radio three years later .   i must say ,  however ,  that where i found jackson's films an increasingly indulgent disappointment ,  the bakshi version ,  for all that it has been cut to the bone ,  is actually more accurate .  yes ,  there are the usual ,  understandable changes  ( here it is legolas rather than arwen who is substituted for glorfindel as the elf sent from rivendell to meet the party )  and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action .   ( the only exception to the latter ,  as others have remarked ,  is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of rivendell ,  where the ringwraiths ,  having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back frodo in mid-flight -- which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river -- then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop ,  which is initially nightmarish but pointless ,  plot-wise ,  and definitely goes on too long .  )  i would also agree that the balrog is unsatisfactory ,  due partly to bad animation ,  and that gandalf windmills his arms too much .   but having watched both approaches to the film ,  i feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take .  in a tale that is half-myth  ( oddly enough ,  one thing that is included is a snippet of aragorn's story of beren and luthien )  the extreme literalism required by live-action filming ,  where everything from monsters to mail-shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera ,  is counter-productive :  latex-faced  ( or cgi )  monsters are less monstrous than sketchily-drawn shapes ,  heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies ,  and hobbits or dwarfs with non-human body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly .  many reviewers have cited the sniffing ringwraith in the woods ,  with its crippled ,  half-human movements ,  as one of the scariest moments in the film -- it certainly frightened me silly when i saw it for the first time alone in the dark !   the extreme stylisation of the introduction  ( plus a voice-over done with great skill and economy to sum up the back-story in a few sentences )  works very well to depict an almost mythical era ,  and the change to the comic-book rusticism of the shire -- i particularly like the proudfeet -- corresponds effectively to the similar change in tone of tolkien's prose .  i did feel that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could have been used to great effect :  gandalf threatening bilbo with his true power in the opening scenes ,  bilbo seeming to become a gollum-like creature under the influence of ring-lust at rivendell ,  and galadriel's famous temptation speech all were drawn more or less straight ,  where it would have been trivial to distort the scene to reflect the hobbits' changed perceptions .  but generally speaking the changes in detail and palette -- firelight hues at bree ,  bright colours re-emerging at rivendell and in the fangorn clearing ,  dirty greys and browns for moria and the desolate lands -- work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes ,  where a live-action approach simply doesn't allow you to blur the background or sketch in a stylised setting .   as a fan i didn't care for either jackson's or bakshi's depiction of lothlorien -- again ,  i feel that the radio soundscape was the best evocation i've come across of a beautiful ,  slightly uncanny woodland paradise caught out of time -- and i feel that bakshi got the elven singing at this point pretty badly wrong ,  but i do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the company relaxing together after their travails in moria .  aragorn giving a hobbit-fencing-lesson here is as charming  ( and equally uncanonical )  a spectacle as boromir engaging with the hobbits in hollin in the jackson version .   the depiction of aragorn as convincingly weatherworn ranger is good throughout this film  ( viggo mortensen's scruffy jesus look really didn't work for me )  ,  although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to 'clean up' the character in the second half for gondor's benefit .  john hurt ,  unsurprisingly ,  gives a sterling vocal performance ,  as does a resonant william squire in the part of gandalf .  the hobbits are ,  i suspect ,  intended to reflect contemporary youth as audience-identification figures :  i find the animated style  ( their proportions are much more 'cartoonish' than those of the human characters )  works well to differentiate them ,  and the whole 'hairy feet' thing as drawn here comes across as much more plausible than in more literal depictions ,  including much fan art .   personally i have less objection to boromir as viking -- he was always a fairly bludgeoning type -- than to beardy-aragorn  ( illogical :  they were both numenorians ,  after all )  ,  although i am clearly in a minority here !   the big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project ,  with a bizarre tacked-on voice-over ending attempting to resolve matters .  a pity ;  it would have been interesting ,  not to mention less frustrating ,  to see what bakshi planned to make of shelob and minas tirith ,  never mind the dead .  .  . 
with the release of peter jackson's famed  " lord of the rings "  trilogy ,  it is even easier to dismiss ralph bakshi's 1978 animated lord of the rings film as inferior .  i agree with the majority that jackson's trilogy is the essential film adaptation of tolkien's work ,  but that does not prevent me from enjoying bakshi's ambitious pioneering effort .  jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing bakshi's film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptations .   the film's colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable .  i was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters .  the pairs of pippin and merry and eowyn and galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually ,  the balrog and treebeard were unimpressive ,  but these points didn't bother me very much .  however ,  the nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie .  the only character representation i was bothered by was sam's ;  he was made to look unbecomingly silly .   this film is novel for its animation techniques .  in addition to hand-drawn characters ,  live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping .  it is quite apparent which characters are hand-drawn and which are rotoscoped ,  but none the less i found that the film's style was a novelty .  the use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out well .   the voice acting was generally of high quality .  particularly good was john hurt ,  who provided an authoritative voice for aragorn .  aragorn isn't a favorite character of mine from the stories ,  but backed by john hurt's voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation .  my other favorite was william squire ,  whose voice is appropriately strong for gandalf .  the only actor who seemed inappropriate was michael scholes as sam ,  whose voice acting was irritating and added to sam's unfortunately silly image .  the only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names .  particularly strange was the decision to frequently have saruman referred to as  " aruman "  .   in producing this film ,  ralph bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films .  hence ,  this film contains about half the story ,  from the start of  " the fellowship of the ring "  to the end of the battle at helm's deep in  " the two towers "  .  the obvious implication of this is that the film's story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books .  i enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations ,  but the liberties taken to compress the story didn't bother me ,  even the choice to leave arwen out of the story .  enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the lord of the rings story in 132 minutes .  the battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at helm's deep were tremendous .   ralph bakshi's version of  " the lord of the rings "  isn't perfect and no doubt a number of lord of the rings readers lament the cuts to the story .  however ,  for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy .  my only strong lament is that i am unable to see the second part of this  " first great tale "  of the lord of the rings since bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel . 
i only wish that return of the jedi ,  have been directed by somebody else ,  i mean ,  there is far too much ewoks scenes ,  completely unnecessary .  besides this time our heroes look like different people :  princess leia no longer fights with solo ,  luke looks boring ,  darth vader is not as evil as before ,  and yoda just dies .   but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it .   some spoilers 1- jabba the hut 2- the sail barge attack sequence .  3-the emperor  ( now that's evil )  4- the speeders chase at the endor forest .  5-the last battle .  6-the dark side seduction scene .  7-the return of anakin to the good side of the force .  8- and the last celebration .   some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes .  if some scenes would have been cut ,  and another director was hired ,  this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 ,  but still is extraordinary .  9 out of 10 . 
when a small hobbit named frodo baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle ,  the wizard gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord .  should the ring end up back in his hands ,  he will regain his power and destroy middle earth .  frodo and his loyal friends set out on a a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors .  this is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story .  regardless ,  this is an epic and wonderfully animated film .   the animation is superbly done with rotoscope ,  which is tracing over live action footage .  ralph bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given .  the film also boasts a grand music score by leonard rosenman that fits every scene .  there are a few plot holes with the script ,  but that has to be excused ,  considering the original deal was to make the book trilogy into two films ,  much had to crammed in the first one .  my biggest gripe is some of the character design ,  samwise was a bit too goofy ,  while the other hobbits act completely normal .  the other characters are actually well written for the screen ,  and the voice actors do a great job ,  i was pleased that legolas is actually a bit more helpful to the plot .  the rotoscoped orcs are more comical than frightening ,  while the ringwraiths are eerie and nightmarish .   another problem is that the evil wizard saruman is called aruman ,  thanks to the writers .  overall ,  i think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice ,  but there is something charming about it .  ralph bakshi made a valiant effort of making screen adaption of these classic stories .  the film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live action films ,  but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages . 
a very good movie .  a classic sci-fi film with humor ,  action and everything .  this movie offers a greater number of aliens .  we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the imperial forces .  the emperor is somewhat an original character .  i liked the ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the vietnamese .   ( excellent references )  i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga .  in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls .  i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vader's redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obi-wan .  it gives a sadness and a tear .  the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie :  when vader turns on the emperor .  luke watches and finds comfort in seeing obi-wan ,  yoda and .  .  . his father  ( 1997 version not hayden christenssen )  .  the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia .  there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending .  i felt there was much more than meets the eye .  and as always the john william's music will bring the classicism into star wars universe . 
peter jacksons version ( s )  are better films overall from objective point of view .  that being said ,  they are not my favorite screen versions of lord of the rings ,  and let me explain why .    firstly ,  the acting of the on-screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with jackson's lotr .  the whole cast is too run of the mill .   " are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of ralph bakshi version are better actors than real people ?  "  one could ask .  well ,  they are not really silly ( save for hobbits ,  later about them )  and they certainly pack more personality than jackson's party - even with much more limited dialogue time .  and that is because of superior _voice_ acting of the bakshi's lotr .  take aragorn for example .  in this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority ( aragorn the lord ) and with a seasoned rasp ( aragorn the ranger )  .  this is due to john hurt's brilliant voice acting .  compare that to viggo mortensen's rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven :  hurt beats mortensen hands down .    and then there is gandalf .  probably the most dominating ( and the most popular )  character in the whole saga .  in this bakshi version gandalf ( william squire )  is a real wizard .  and by that i don't mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips ( he does not )  ,  but his presence is just captivating .  he is a mystical ,  powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease .  add to that his looks :  tall ,  old as the ancient oak ,  beard long as his body ,  sharp eyes ,  wizardy hook nose and of course ,  the classical wizard hat .  a perfect gandalf ,  just like in the books .  ian mckellen's gandalf in the other hand ,  is simply just too boring .  he looks too human ,  sounds too human ,  acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword .  yes a sword .  in this bakshi version gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword ( as he did in the books )  .  and those are stylish slow motion kills .  gandalf is not a power to be messed with .  and it must be noted ,  that while i'm sad to say this ,  the great christopher lee didn't bring saruman alive .  fraser kerr in this movie did ,  even with a very limited screen time and lines .   before i move completely to visual aspects of the movie ,  it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the orcs are also superior to jackson's pretendeous bad guys .  bakshi's orcs taunt their enemies ( or each other )  constantly with growls ,  screams and nasty language .  they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion .  and finally ,  the black riders - or the nazgul .  those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one - not just some riders wearing black .  and they speak with haunting voice ,  which mesmerizes their victim .  my favorite scene in the film is when the nazgul are chasing frodo near the river .  while peter jackson couldn't do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party ,  bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky .   but as much i like this film more than jackson's ,  the latter are ,  if only technically ,  still better .  and that is because of some key visuals .  as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated characters ( all hobbits and the main cast )  and real actors covered with paint .  i don't really have a problem using real people in animation this way ,  but they just don't fit very well with traditional cartoon figures .  this is especially true with humans ( riders of rohan ,  tavern people etc .  )  orcs are different matter ,  since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters .  orcs ,  while played by humans with animation mix ,  look far superior to jacksons version .  they have brownish-green skin ,  shiny red eyes ,  flat face and pointed teeth .    biggest screw up in this films visuals ,  howerver ,  are the hobbits .  while i prefer almost every character in bakshi version compared to jackson ,  the latter has clearly superior hobbits ,  in fact they are perfect .  with bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid disney bambies .  and you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them ,  so be warned .  again ,  the voice acting is ok with them too ,  but the actors mouths cannot save the  " immersion damage "  made by these little weasels .  well ,  i never really liked those halflings anyway .    general failures in the bakshi script are well known .  limited playing time ( with limited budget )  and a lot of missing scenes .  so while this film covers nearly half of the story ,  it doesn't do it in extensive detail compared to jackson's version .    in a summary the ralph bakshi version of lotr has a superior :   -overall atmosphere  ( it feels more like middle-earth )  -overall voice acting -music  ( i really dig the fantasy score by kont & rosenman )  -gandalf -aragorn  ( one of the john hurt's finest roles )  -king theoden -orcs -black riders -elrond  ( he's not some fairy hippie in this one !  )   while jackson version is better :   -because it covers the whole story -overall visuals and special effects -gollum/smeagol -balrog -hobbits  lord of the rings by ralph bakshi ,  even with it's well known shortcomings ,  is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of tolkien's fantasy world very well ,  if not perfectly .  i'll give it a score of 8½ out of 10 . 
i happened upon this movie as an 8-10 year old on a cold ,  dark november afternoon .  i was outside playing all day ,  freezing ,  and when i came in around 4pm ,  i had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the tv with a blanket .  i was surprised to be watching a cartoon that wasn't all happy and silly--and was in fact dark ,  and moralistic .  it captured my imagination .  i'm sure it misses the text ,  and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the tolkien purist .  but it still captures the spirit of the story ,  the choice to carry a burden for the good of others ,  the consequences of selfish ,  rash decisions ,  etc .  the quality of animation leaves room for complaint .  but the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations .  john hurt is great in this .  if you don't like how the character is drawn ,  look away ,  and just listen to him .  his voice is extraordinary .  i've seen it again many ,  many times and it always brings me back to that time ,  as a kid ,  thirsty for some magical adventure .  it's for this reason i say 'lucky' ,  the film is nostalgic for me so i overlook its shortcomings .  but between john hurt ,  and tolkien's fantasy ,  it still reached me ,  and still does . 
my friend had the idea of watching the animated lotr after seeing the peter jackson return of the king .  so i finally bought it off e-bay ,  thinking right from the start it was going to suck .  actually ,  it really wasn't as bad as i thought it would be .  the animation was good for its time ,  they used a unique method of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effects ,  and the guy who did the voice for frodo sounded somewhat like elijah wood .   not the greatest adaptation of a book ,  but trust me ,  i've seen a lot worse .  it skips quite a lot of things ,  since both fellowship and the two towers are compressed into one two hour movie .  definatley worth a watch ,  kids might like ,  but still ,  absoutley no comparision with the peter jackson trilogy . 
first of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book ,  especially when you're dealing with master writer like tolkien .  this adaptation wonderfully synthesizes tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia ,  aesthetics ,  and liberal culture .  yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little  " rough "  in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less ,  and very evocative in terms of giving a unique  " sense of place "  to each of the scenes .  beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting that's far superior to the acting in the new live action movies .  and while the cell animation might not be the most  " technically proficient "  animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced .  the background paintings vary from traditional  " fantasy "  motif to outright abstraction ,  but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film .  if you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then i can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting ,  transcendental imagery ,  and jrr tolkien then this film is a must see . 
i'm fond of this film and it vexes me that so many  " reviewers "  rank it below the peter jackson trilogy .  a filmed novel is always interpretive ;  in particular an animated film relies on the artist's vision and should be judged on its own terms .  speaking as a purist ,  this is a finer homage to tolkien than the updated version .  while this film has its flaws it stays truer to the source ,  especially so far as the characters are concerned .   in the jackson version tolkien's frodo is barely recognizable :  from the first scenes he is portrayed as a weakling ,  constantly wavering ,  manipulated by forces around him and never standing on his own two feet  ( this is physically and metaphorically true .  )  you wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit to carry the one ring to the cracks of doom .  jackson unforgivably rewrites tolkien and robs frodo of his finest moment when he allows arwen to rescue him from the ringwraiths .  .  . bakshi's version respects the original ,  presenting a frodo who demands the wraiths  " go back and trouble me no more !  "  bakshi sustains frodo's character as tolkien conceived it .  we see his decline as the weight of his burden increases .  frodo is so pivotal to lord of the rings you wonder why jackson took such liberties  ( he does so with numerous characters ) since character development propels the plot to its inevitable conclusion .  bakshi's film better explores the companionship between legolas and gimli in a few judicious scenes that are completely lacking in jackson's version .  similarly we see boromir horsing with pippin and merry ,  furthering the idea of fellowship .  for my liking the camaraderie is more developed in the animated version than the live action .   tolkien's poetry is an important ingredient in the novels and bakshi makes tribute to this in one of my favorite scenes :  when frodo sings the  " merry old inn "  song ,  minutes before stumbling into strider .  the cheery tune is chillingly juxtaposed with the darker theme music when seconds later ,  invisible to his friends but visible to the wraiths ,  frodo is dangerously exposed .  this is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever i see it .   the well documented budget/time restrictions limit this film's final impact but had it been completed it may have resonated with more viewers .  as it is ,  it's worth a look .  even its detractors admit that peter jackson derived much of his inspiration from this prototype . 
first of all ,  the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story being  " altered "  .  well guess what ?  peter jackson's film wasn't a perfect rendition either .  well enough ranting .  this is a very beautiful film .  the backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known tolkein artists .  the film covers about half the trilogy  ( fellowship of the ring and up to the battle of helms deep in the two towers )  and moves at a good pace .  the voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like i imagined they would .  samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes ,  but aragorn looks awesome .  the film has a great score that completely supports the movie .  if you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading  ( the books are even better )  give this movie a try ,  keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago .   also of particular note :  peter jackson's adaption of fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as ralph bakshi's  ( jackson has said many times how much he admired bakshi's effort )  . 
godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one ,  and probably the strongest kind that could be made about ralph bakshi's take on tolkien's magnum opus the lord of the rings ,  has actually been made by peter jackson .  the recent trilogy ,  to me ,  aren't even total masterpieces ,  but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post-modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good ,  sweeping entertainments .    but as one who has not read the books ,  i end up now looking upon the two versions ,  live-action  ( albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way )  and animated  ( albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework )  in relation to just the basic story ,  not even complete faithfulness to the books .  and with bakshi's version ,  it's almost not fair in a way ,  as what we do see is really not the complete vision ,  not what jackson really had  ( probably final cut )  .  robbed of return of the king's big climactic rush of the story ,  and with the other two parts becoming rushed ,  i ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations ,  though as such those same limitations make it disappointing .   what's interesting too ,  after seeing the jackson films first- which i also slightly regret being that i might've reacted to this differently when i was younger and prior to five years ago- is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with .  everything that is really needed to tell the fellowship of the ring story is actually pretty much intact ,  and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in tolkien's book is given some clarity in this section .  the actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes ,  are more or less adequate for the parts ,  with a few parts standing out  ( john hurt as aragorn and william squire as gandalf )  .    the lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face-value for those who've not even seen the other films or read the books and can't put them into context .  but there is some level of interest always with the characters ,  and here there's a more old-fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more .  this is not a garden variety disney adaptation- warts and all ,  this is a bakshi film ,  with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of middle earth .   and what bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen ,  in all its abbreviated form ,  its hit or miss appeal .  along with being not totally complete as a film ,  or as stories ,  the form of the film is an experiment ,  to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped .  the results end up bringing what seems now to be retro ,  but at the time of course was something that was a rough ,  crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers .  might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation ?  in some parts ,  yeah ;  it does become a little noticeable ,  as was also the case in bakshi's american pop ,  that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky ,  like some kind of comic-book form done in a different way .  still ,  there's much i admired in what was done .    the orcs ,  for example ,  i found to be really amazing in they're surreal surroundings .  they're maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live-action ,  especially during parts where there isn't battle footage  ( that's really the real hit-or-miss section ,  as there isn't continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping )  ,  and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback .  it's creepy in a good way .  and the backgrounds ,  while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy ,  are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together .  it's almost something for art-film buffs as much as for the ring-nuts .   so ,  how would i recommend this animated take on the lord of the rings ?  i don't know ,  to tell the truth .  it's certainly a good notch above the other tolkien animated film i've seen ,  the hobbit  ( and i've yet to see the animated rotk )  ,  and there is some real artistry going on .  there's also some stilted dialog ,  an all-too-rushed two towers segment with the most intriguing character gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all .  and seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films .    if you're a fan of the books contemplating checking this out ,  i would say it's worth a chance ,  even if it's one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not .  as for it fitting into bakshi's other films i've seen it's an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement ,  where as with lynch's dune it's bound to draw a dark ,  mordor-like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who don't .  i don't . 
as an animated film from 1978 ,  this is pretty good--generally well above the standard of the days when disney hadn't done anything good in years  ( and tolkien cared little for disney anyway )  .  it gets major points for innovative and careful camera work ,  applying cinematic techniques with relative success .  the much-maligned rotoscoping actually works pretty well ,  especially with the ringwraiths ,  and the opening narration .  however ,  it is so drastically overused--possibly as a money-saving technique--that it detracts from the overall effect .  the same technique that makes wraiths spooky and otherworldly doesn't fare so well in the prancing pony .   as for the adaptation of the story ,  it's actually quite good .  we lose little bits here and there ,  minor details such as the old forest and tom bombadil ,  the gaffer and the sackville-bagginses .  we compress a few characters ,  such as revising legolas as one of elrond's household and an old friend of aragorn's ,  but that's a rather wise decision for film .  in books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the elves and middle-earth's vast history .  in film ,  you trade that for visuals and sound that convey the same elements in a different way .  nothing critical is truly lost here ,  and although i have minor quibbles about some of the changes ,  i'm generally pretty happy with it .   if only the dratted writers had managed to remember saruman's name--he's frequently referred to as aruman ,  a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarly-named sauron ;  it took me a second viewing before i was certain i hadn't misheard it .  it's also annoying that boromir is a bloody stage viking ,  and irritable from the start .  however ,  gandalf is excellent ,  and most of the rest of the voicework is excellent .  if only john hurt weren't too old to play aragorn ;  i love his voice .   of course ,  with the film ending at the midpoint of the story ,  there's a vast disappointment built in .  what makes it far ,  far worse is the altogether miserable job done by the rankin & bass crew on the sequel .  that they were permitted to do return of the king after butchering the hobbit remains a huge mystery ;  they seem more interested in bad songs than in proper storytelling .  for all its faults ,  this film's heart is solidly in place and it tries very hard to accomplish a nearly impossible task .  i can only hope that the upcoming series of films keeps as true to its vision .  .  . 
more than twenty years before peter jackson's visionary adaptation of the lord of the rings ,  there was this 1978 animated effort from director ralph bakshi .  an ambitious and reasonably faithful version of the story ,  this has sadly been rather over-shadowed by the jackson trilogy .  indeed ,  many reviewers here on the imdb  ( mainly those who saw the newer version first )  seem to be fiercely unkind to this version .  .  .  .  but if one applies a little common sense ,  and takes into consideration the time when it was made and the technical possibilities that existed at that time ,  then they will realise that this is a pretty good film .  indeed ,  it was shortly after seeing this animated movie back in the early '80s that i sought out tolkien's book and immediately became a lifelong fan of these richly detailed middle earth adventures .  so ,  in some respects ,  i owe this film a degree of acknowledgement as the film which shaped my literary tastes forever .   sauron ,  the dark lord of middle earth ,  forges an all-powerful ring that gives him incredible power .  following a great battle during which sauron is defeated ,  the ring falls into possession of a king named isildur .  but instead of destroying it he foolishly chooses to keep it .  for centuries the ring passes from hand to hand ,  eventually coming into the possession of a hobbit named frodo baggins who lives in a peace-loving community known as the shire .  frodo learns from a wizard named gandalf that his ring is in fact the one ring ,  the very same that was forged by sauron all those centuries ago ,  and that its master is once again searching for it in order to restore his dark power over the entire land .  frodo embarks on a perilous journey to protect the ring with three other hobbit companions ,  but every step of the way they are hunted by sauron's ring-wraiths ,  the black riders .  there follow many adventures ,  during which a company of nine adventurers is formed to guide the ring to the only place where it can be  " unmade "   mount doom ,  in the land of mordor .  the film concludes with frodo and his best friend sam on the borders of mordor ,  closing ever nearer to their horrifying destination .  meanwhile gandalf and the other members of the company fight off a huge army of orcs at the legendary fortress of helm's deep .   this version covers just over half of the original book .  a second instalment was planned to bring the story to an end ,  but was sadly never completed .  while the ending feels abrupt ,  it does at least end at a sensible point in the story .  one has to feel a little frustration and regret that no sequel exists in which we might follow these animated heroes to their eventual goal .  the animation is passable ,  with a nice variety of locales and characters presented in interesting detail .  the music by leonard rosenman is suitably stirring and fits in appropriately with the epic narrative .  the voice-overs are decent ,  too ,  especially john hurt as aragorn and peter woodthorpe as gollum .  on the other hand ,  michael scholes - who provides the voice for sam - is rather campy and goofy ,  which is not well suited to the character .  the lord of the rings is a commendable attempt to visualise the staggering book on which it is based . 
i really enjoyed the reunion a lot !  i would have rated it a 10 if they had had  " hassie "  and  " little luke "  .  there wasn't even a mention of where they are today or why they didn't participate in the reunion .  they were very popular characters and i think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance .   anyway ,  i was glad that tnn ran the series again !  i had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series  ( i may have missed a few episodes )  .  jenny hanahan
this film ,  in my opinion ,  is ,  despite it's flaws  ( which i maintain are *few* )  ,  an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art .   what mr .  bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films .  he does not receive 1/100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience .  if it were not for mr .  bakshi ,  i don't believe animation would have survived the disney onslaught .  what is more ,  with the lord of the rings ,  he has not only created a beautiful animated film ,  but he has created an entirely new art form - unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground .   most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film  ( the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation )  .  but i feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm .  no ,  this is not disney animation .  no it's not live action .  no ,  it's not  " cheating "  - what it is is a new ,  fascinating ,  and absolutely wonderful art form .  something so fresh ,  and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as  " the lord of the rings "  .  bakshi's pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way ,  in particular ,  the darker of tolkien's creatures ,  particularly the nazgul ,  are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish .   peter s .  beagle's screenplay  ( based very little ,  as i understand it ,  on an early draft by chris conkling )  is a very loyal adaptation of tolkien's works .  where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created .  there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film ,  but there are very few changes to the storyline .  there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled :  the reforging of narsil ,  the gifts of galadriel ,  the huorns at the battle of the hornburg ,  but ,  again ,  with the time limitations he had  ( already the longest animated feature in history )  ,  these are certainly understandable  ( though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel )  .   also there is the delightful  ( one of my favorites )  score by leonard rosenman  ( who also scored barry lyndon and star trek iv  ( the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work )  )  .  it is bombastic and audacious and ,  dare i say ,  perfect .  it stands on it's own as an orchestral triumph ,  but when coupled with the images of the film ,  it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection .  so far from the typical hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off .   the voice actors are wonderful .  of particular note is john hurt as aragorn who just oozes the essence of strider .   the character design is also wonderfully unique ,  though not often to everyone's taste .  but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he/she imagines ,  not what you might have imagined ,  and so aragorn is realized with a distinctive native american feel and boromir appears in viking inspired garb .  this is perhaps not what you imagined ,  but i can only applaud mr .  bakshi for showing us what he  " saw "  .  it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with priscilla tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film .   one farther word - the flight to the ford sequence ,  in my opinion ,  is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid .  bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment ,  and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build .  bakshi's artistic ability and tolkien's incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled .   the recent dvd release  ( 2001 )  by warner brothers ,  is sorely lacking .  while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format ,  the package is woefully short of extras .  how glorious it would have been to have had a director's commentary ,  been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release .  another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over .  also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film .  this version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score .   of course ,  the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made .  we will never be able to see bakshi's interpretation of gondor ,  of shelob ,  of faramir ,  of the cracks of doom ,  of eowyn's battle with the witch king or gandalf's confrontation with him .  we will never be graced with bakshi's image of denethor or the palatir or the paths of the dead .  it is a shame beyond all shames that we will ,  in the end ,  have to accept peter jackson's glitz and glitter hollywood ,  action film version of these later events in tolkien's masterpiece ,  but ,  i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all .   david
this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies .    the starting point of the movie was almost like episode iv--spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place ,  where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious .  he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of bantha ,  who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark .  luke's jedi powers eventually finish the monster off .  adding to the sneaky rescue of han solo ,  who was frozen alive at the end of episode v ,  jabba was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the sarlacc pit outside .   but all of the star wars  " good guys "  ,  especially r2-d2 ,  had other ideas .  .  . and those other ideas fended off luke's execution ;  in the end ,  most of jabba's soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to fatally choke jabba to death .   like in episode iv ,  the death star in episode vi makes its appearance .  as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star ,  the star destroyer personnel ,  i guessed ,  sped up the arming of the main laser ,  using the imperial fighters as a diversion .  the 20-25 star destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise .  once it fired ,  the rebel fleet's only hope was that the death star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out ,  and this affected lando so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he couldn't until the shield was taken out .  and it was taken out with lando's increasing impatience .   like in episode v ,  the imperial walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons ,  killing at least one of the ewoks .  .  . but the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them .  for instance ,  chewbacca ,  as well as another ewok ,  was able to commandeer one of the walkers  ( and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers )  ,  and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers .   it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre ,  like ,  for instance ,  the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike ,  and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike .  or ,  in a climax ,  using the sabre to break off his own father's arm during the final sabre fight with sith vader .   you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown ,  complete with a short display of fireworks ,  drumming on the spoils of victory  ( e . g .  ,  storm trooper masks )  ,  and luke finally meeting up with leia after luke's own nemesis---darth vader ,  now dead ,  is burned on a pyre .  the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy that--even with the strong respect of film composer john williams .   on the home movie version ,  i think lucas himself wanted a different ending .  in addition to the celebration on endor ,  he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets ,  including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith .  the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece .  he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death star's destruction ,  balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies . 
there be very little doubt that hg wells is the most influential writer of the 20th century  .  jules verne has some claim to be the father of science fiction but his stories were more adventure stories using marvellous inventions as plot devices  .  wells was profound and brought subtext to his tales  .  perhaps his greatest legacy is that there's very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century where as now many people including richard dawkins consider it a near certainty  .  there's no evidence of this of course and one can't help wondering that is was wells who introduced this to human thinking  ?  undoubtedly it was wells that planted the seed  .   things to come was adapted by wells himself from his own novel  .  it is rather obvious however that he is unable to tell the difference between the technicalities of writing novels and writing screenplays  .  the dialouge is often laden  ,  heavy handed and unconvincing  .  one case in point is the two pilots from opposing sides discussing the nature of war  "  why must we murder one another  .  why  ?   "  this mirrors the criticism  ,  near naked contempt that orwell had of wells in his essay wells  ,  hitler and the world state and it is true that wells anti-war message is painfully overstated  .  it'd be impossible to believe a conversation taking place between an raf pilot and his opposite number in the luftwaffe a few years later   that said it is absolutely fascinating watching a film from 1935 predicting a world wide war taking place in 1940 that heralds the end of civilisation  .  there's a striking and haunting imagery as a child bangs a drum as a phantom army marches in the background and the collapse of society and the fear of the wanderng sickness is wonderfully realised  .  even the rather lazy storytelling of showing the year of the setting has a compelling nature it's the images that makes this film along with arthur bliss score that makes the film so memorable  .  and to be fair wells does ask the question  "  the universe or nothing  .  what shall it be  ?   "   .  in short this is a film whose flaws are easy to forgive
things to come is an historic film .  along with metropolis  ( 1927 )  ,  it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles .  it is also one of the first doomsday movies .  it is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the second world war within a year ,  and even ,  in a subtle way ,  the year it would end in the real world .  but then the film departs from reality ,  depicting a world ravaged by war  ( only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936 )  .   the last half hour of the film is an incredible sight ,  making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings -- later to become staples of the science fiction genre .  it is sad that ,  after things to come ,  sci-fi would become identified with cheaply made b-movies ,  a stereotype that wouldn't be broken until 2001 : a space odyssey more than 30 years later .  if they'd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film ,  things would have been very different in hollywood .    raymond massey and some of his co-stars play multiple roles in this film ,  to good effect .  massey plays a great  " doctor who " -like role as a pilot from an advanced  ( for 1970 )  civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple-minded warlord  ( a very effective performance by ralph richardson )  .  ultimately ,  the storyline covers 100 years .  but that's a big problem with this film -- there really isn't a cohesive storyline .   perhaps in such an episodic film -- somewhat reminiscent of intolerance ,  actually -- it's hard to have a conventional plot ,  but i felt more could have been made of the material ,  and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission  .  .  .  the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting .  maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci-fi innovation :  a sequel ?   things to come is a film every serious sci-fi buff should see at least once .  unlike metropolis ,  however ,  it might not bear repeated viewings . 
this was the most costly film ,  when produced .  sir alexander korda and h . g .  wells were both distressed by its poor ratings---for good reason .  it was and remains far ahead of its time .  aside from the seemingly poor direction ,  probably editing ,  at the very beginning ,  the work moves along to a stunning conclusion .   whether its sir ralph richardson's 'boss' role ,  or even better ,  his wife's ,  sir cedric's ,  as adversary to space-faring ,  raymond massey's 'john cabal' center role---all deliver mind-boggling performances .   the scene with mr .  korda's incomparable set ,  of the small girl-child ,  running out to an absolutely 'never-to-be-matched' scene ,  commenting 'life just keeps getting lovelier and lovelier' ?  that swiftly brings tears to any parent/grandparent .  this is not a film for the young--unless 'experienced' and rather those who have seen 'the horror' it opposes .   sure ,  the 'phony-parachuting' ,  looks hokey---while using a 'magnetic-cannon' ,  now termed 'mass-driver' may be viewed as ridiculous ,  vs .  rockets---give sir korda a break--mr .  wells made that choice .  and at +/- $8 million ,  this film went way beyond 'over-budget'---so he concentrated on what he could manage .   the true power of this greatest of cinema rests in 'john cabal's' final statement of human destiny---his friend 'passworthy' doubts the wisdom of space-faring ,  saying ,  'we're such little animals . ' john cabal's proper response is ,  ( paraphrased )  'yes ,  little animals ,  and if that is all we are ,  we must live and die as such . ' they are standing under a large astronomical telescope .  he sweeps his hand over the night sky .  'yet we may have all the universe ,  or nothing . '---then the final chorus breaks in---'which shall it be ? '---this is not 'star wars' ,  'blade runner'---anything you may consider 'great'---this is the real thing .   i remind all of steven hawking's most recent address ,  upon his latest 'medal of honor'---'humanity must leave earth ,  or die . '---the very core of this work---i love 'standard entertainment'---yet this 'relic' ,  for the wise viewer ,  offers far more .  'which shall it be ? ' be in the proper 'mood'---whatever that takes---this will take your breath away---i 'guarontee'---overall ,  for humanity ?  the most significant of cinema .    since posting ,  i note many have commented on the poor 'media-quality' of 'surviving' examples .  in the 80's i developed a 'proprietary' 'colorization' process which required a 'clean' original .  this led me to michael korda ,  who sadly noted all were gone---so we must relish what remains---'sad but true ? '
this is an amazing movie from 1936 .  although the first hour isn't very interesting  ( for the modern viewer )  ,  the stylish vision of the year 2036 that comes afterwords makes up for it .  however ,  don't plan on being able to understand all of the dialog - the sound quality and accents  ( it's american - but  " 1930s "  american )  make it difficult .   basically ,  the story is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictional us town called  " everytown "  .  it spans from 1936 ,  when a war is on the horizon ,  to 2036 ,  when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems .   the first one hour is a bit slow - although it's tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought .  the events ,  suspense and visuals are pretty low-key in today's terms .  however ,  when it gets to the future ,  it's just plain fun to watch .  the large sets and retro sci-fi look of everything is hard to beat .   unless you have great listening abilities ,  this movie is hard to listen to .  i think i understood only 80% of the dialog .  it could use closed-captioning .   if you're a sci-fi fan ,  this is one of the genre's classics and is a must see  ( well ,  at least after the first hour )  .  for the average viewer ,  wait until there's a closed caption version and then watch it if you're comfortable with movies of this time period . 
synopsis the future as seen from 1939 england .  as war loomed over europe ,  the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past .  it is up to the brave new world of science to overcome man's past mistakes .   concept in relation to the viewer beware your leaders and what you are told .  thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow .  there will always be descent and fear ,  and learning to overcome it is our only hope .   pros and cons i had seen this film long ago and recently downloaded it off of the internet  ( it is in the public domain )  .  this is a fascinating work on numerous levels .  since it is a story about the future as seen from 1939 ,  it has obvious flaws .  this vision of the future is both terrifying and whimsical .  this film was cutting edge for its day .  the special effects are very good as is the story line .  the acting suffers a bit in the british theatrical sense ,  in that it can lean a bit toward shakespeare .   one of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems ,  which we now know is not always true .  the films other plot line is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us .   the underpinnings of almost all later science fiction movies can be seen in this film .  the set design and wardrobe of  " forbidden planet "  ,  the failings of technology in  " 2001 :  a space odessy "  ,  even the lush landscapes / cityscapes of  " star wars "  owe some amount of inspiration to this film .   the ending of the film leaves the viewer a bit perplexed .  while it is optimistic in its ending sequence of reaching for the stars ,  we are left to wonder if mankind will ever be able to make it .  even as we reach ,  there are those that are trying to hold us back .  this films vision of the future while interesting is also a bit humorous by todays standards .  huge flying machines and guns that could shoot people into space never materialized in the real world ,  but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step .   many great british actors are in this film as young men .  cedric hardwicke and ralph richardson are the most recognized and their oratory skills are evident here .  raymond massey is a curious choice to play the lead character ,  cabel .  his character almost comes across as the new christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science .   this is a good piece of cinema history whose themes are still relevant today even if its vision of the future missed the mark . 
this movie is difficult to watch in our fast-paced culture of the 21st century ,  but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys ,  chiefly the consequences and ramifications of technology upon society ,  specifically when that technology is used for warfare .   this movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology ,  but as the circle completes itself ,  familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self-serving rather than self-destructive ways that humanity may utilize technology .   brilliant for it's time ,  the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some ,  but as a landmark in the history ,  development ,  and evolution of the sci-fi genre ,  it is a must .  in the end ,  free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed ,  the state of  society itself ,  as shaped by world events .   those who are downtrodden by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so ,  but yet there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains ,  as this film posits .   as far as qualifying as sci-fi ,  one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is it's speculative nature .  it asks us the questions ,  what if these events happened this way ,  and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it ?  how would we react ?   as far as influence ,  this film projects those speculative sciences that make sci-fi as unique as it is and keeps us asking those important questions . 
with such actors as ralph richardson ,  raymond massey ,  cedrick hardwicke ,  and margaretta scott ,  how can you go wrong .  very unusual scenics ,  especially the modern ones .  the realization of the modern machinery is very effective .  here you have ray-gun blasts from building vehicles that help clear the area ,  so new structures can be made .  although she's much younger in this film ,  it's not very hard to figure out who the future mrs .  pumphrey from the bbc series ,  all creatures great and small is going to be !  really effective  " reappearance "  of both raymond massey and ralph richardson .  the musical score is by the renowned swiss composer ,  artur honegger and it is also unusual .  for the time  ( 1936 )  it looks like they used really ,  large sets or the effects make it seem that way .  lastly ,  it's a really good story . 
i have ,   " things to come ,  "  on d . v . d .  and it's very clear compared to my vhs version .  the audio is fair ,  but can be hard to understand at times .    i liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found it . it gave details of why some things happened .  the best things about the movie are the small things that i didn't notice at first .  such as ,  john cabal playing with a toy airplane at a christmass party ,  like it was a dive bomber ,  out dateing sea power by naming a battleship ,  " dinosuar .  "  ships sunk by air-power ,  an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes .  swept flying wing planes .  strong rolls for the women through the entire movie .    there are more ,  see the movie to enjoy them . 
h . g .  wells story the shape of things to come was made into a movie in 1935 . very well made science fiction tale about a war that lasts for decades . great cast includes ; raymond massey ( arsenic and old lace )  sir cedric hardwick ( ghost of frankenstein ) ralph richardson ( time bandits )  and margaretta scott . early glimpses of helicopters , holograms , a rocket ship , and futuristic cities . this film was ahead of its time . directed by william cameron menzies ( invaders from mars ) its very enjoyable much like the earlier movie metropolis ( 1927 ) but avoid the so called sequel the shape of things to come , that was made in 1979 .  this movie has nothing to do with the original . h . g .  wells like jules verne had a vision for the future with his stories . a classic science fiction movie . 10 out of 10
amazing effects for a movie of this time .  a primer of the uselessness of war and how war becomes a nurturer of itself .   a wonderful thing about this movie is it is now public domain and available at archive . org .  no charge ,  no sign up necessary .  watch it in one sitting and you will be propelled .   i plan to share this flick with as many people as possible as i had never heard of it before and i am a hard core sci fi fan .   i would like to see how others react to this movie .   watch it .   rate it .   tell us what you think . 
i watched the mccoys reunion and was glad to see richard crenna and kathleen nolan and tony martinez !  !  ! to see them now was wonderful ,  because i always watched the show growing up so when the tv said that there was going to be a reunion i was so excited  !  !  !  !  the only thing i could not figure out is why lydia reed  ( hassie mccoy )  and michael winkelman ( little luke )  was not on there . i know that walter brennan had died .  so i got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to lydia reed (  hassie mccoy )  and michael winkelman  ( little luke i would be thankful !  !  !  i have searched everywere and no luck  . the only thing i could find out about michael winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946 .  this show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned . the shows today dont have that . the whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them so since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do !  !  !  thank you glenda
when i think of return of the jedi i think epic .  yeah ewoks were in there so what ?  they're an interesting add to the movie  ( not to mention they are similar to the vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts )  .  jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies .  emperor palpatine  ( portrayed by the amazing theater actor ian mcdiarmid )  was one the best parts of the movie .  palpatine is so evil and vicious ,  vader looks like mr .  rogers compared to him  .  speaking of darth vader ,  what an amazing end to such an iconic character .  vader is truly a modern day greek tragedy and i think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after revenge of the sith came out .  his redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you .  the best part was of course the special effects .  it's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it's graphics .  the scenes at jabba's palace  ( leia looks amazing in that metal bikini )  and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at .  in all jedi's deep plot and emotional moments  ( primarily between luke vader and palpatine and when luke reveals the truth to leia )  and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history . 
things to come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction ;  both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress .  it makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later ,  but is woefully naive in it's utopian ideals .   raymond massey ,  cedric hardwicke ,  and ralph richardson make up a fine cast ,  although the drama is played more as a stage piece ,  than a work of cinema .  there are grandiose ,  if somewhat stilted speeches ,  often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater .  however ,  there are some profound words there .  is technology the savior of mankind ,  or the instrument of its destruction ?  the film is a visual feast ,  if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects .  sure ,  hollywood is more sophisticated today ,  but rarely as inventive .  for the imaginative ,  the third act is a treat :  a world with underground cities ,  massive deco bombers ,  space cannons ,  gyro copters ,  and secret organizations of scientist saviors .  it has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure ,  but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise .   things to come and metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic hollywood science fiction cinema .  they are operatic in scope ,  and visually inspiring .  technology has long left them behind ,  but their ideas still burst forth .  there is an artistry there ,  one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today .  these films are the products of artisans ,  not industrialists . 
geniuses william cameron menzies and herbert george wells craft this extraordinary anticipation film ,  with ambition and scope hard to find today .  they predict world war ii and the way great britain was attacked ,  and also the fact that the war would be followed by a space race .  they change the timing ;  in the film the war and the space exploration are much longer ,  but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it's amazing .  we even see an helicopter  ( the film is older than them )  .   unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists that seem romans with bubble-helmets :  if you can see through those funny costumes you may appreciate the state of the art architecture by masters from the 30s ,  well's vision of a rationalistic society ,  interesting reflections on the nature of power ,  and john cabal as archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being ,  the one that chooses to shape reality and not to be shaped by it .   9 1/2 out of 10 .  inspiring like that final monologue by john cabal . 
this sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in 1936 .  visually it is a wonder to behold ,  but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress . this gets very corny when the actors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all times . raymond massey and cedric hardwicke , both great actors , come off as quite a pair of fanatics .  ralph richardson is very good as the  " the boss "  a megalomaniac warlord .  the prediction of world war ii was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time .  i'm sure glad that war didn't turn out as it did in the movie .  there are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movie's different episodes .  although its not as entertaining as i hoped it would be , this movie sticks in your mind long after you've seen it . 
if scientists behaved in a way that h . g .  wells was confident they would in the future ,  history wouldn't quite have turned out the way it did in things to come .  were almost 80 years past the point that wells wrote the shape of things to come on which this film is based and no closer to the world he describes than before ,  in some ways farther away .   though such well known players as raymond massey ,  ralph richardson ,  and cedric hardwicke are in the cast ,  they're more caricatures than real characters .  it's the main weakness with the film ,  it's devoted to wells's philosophy of science will solve all problems and the rest of us are backward fools .   massey's characters ,  two generations of the same family holds that supremely optimistic view .  cedric hardwicke is a skeptic who feels man is rushing too far forward .  and ralph richardson is a warlord arisen from the destruction of another thirty years war fought with modern weapons .  by the way as the atomic bomb had not been invented ,  poison gas was deemed to be weapon that almost destroys mankind .   according to wells ,  science and conquest can never mix .  scientists as a group are far too above the world of politics to engage in such things .  in wells's lifetime scientists certainly fled the rightwing fascistic governments of hitler and mussolini .  those same folks however in order to defeat them ,  subordinated themselves to the allies and fashioned the atomic weapons that ushered in the modern age .  if they behaved as wells would have liked them to ,  someone like albert einstein would have headed a junta of scientists who would have established a new order after world war ii .    wells got it wrong both in time and in development .  he apparently never envisioned the computer as well as atomic power .  computer programmers are far more likely to be our rulers in a brave new world than scientists at the moment .  still things to come ,  aided by the direction of william cameron menzies and the sets created offer an interesting glimpse into the mind of h . g .  wells ,  certainly a respected thinker of his time though he didn't quite get right the shape of things to come . 
the first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians .  the 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources .  it has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement .  it depicts a space gun/launcher and a helicopter ,  along with inventive mass communication devices ,  elevators ,  flat screen panels ,  and wireless intercoms .  it's probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future .  but it portrays a child-like vision of boundless scientific/technological investigation .   to me ,  it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded thinkers guided by a spinozean-like morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a unified world government .  the pro-progress characters  ( such as the two cabals )  believe humanity could 'live forever' by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations ,  always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants .   arthur c .  clarke  ( author of 2001 :  a space odyssey )  suggested this film to stanley kubrick as an example of an excellent sf movie .  kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on clarke's suggestions  ( source :  clarke's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel )  .  though the late clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best sf movies .  it has a beautiful menzies art design ,  but mediocre special effects  ( esp .  the toy tanks )  .   i personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity .  it is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time .  it also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress .  it seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster .  but it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats of space accidents and deaths .  it challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happiness :   cabal :   " too much {rest} and too soon ,  and we call it death .  but for man no rest and no ending .  he must go on--conquest beyond conquest .  this little planet and its winds and ways ,  and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him .  then the planets about him ,  and at last out across immensity to the stars .  and when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time--still he will be beginning .  "    cabal :   " if we are no more than animals--we must snatch at our little scraps of happiness and live and suffer and pass ,  mattering no more--than all the other animals do--or have done .  "  {he points out at the stars . }  " it is that--or this ?  all the universe--or nothingness .  .  .  "   ( quotes from screenplay )  .   if this sounds like a rationalization for devoting all of society to progress ,  then the council members  ( of the world government )  will seem like technocrats .  but actually those  " technocrats "  allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely ,  and they would have to be suppressed by government bans ,  laws against science and experiment ,  and other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrants .   in fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel belittled by all the council's developments of science and technology ,  so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the council's freedom to experiment .  the progress oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels though ,  only preparing its 'peace gas' in times of emergency and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progress .   so it's also a story about the freedom to do science ,  just as much as it's about the wonders of progress .  many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises ,  except in cases of social bias  ( many want to ban cloning ,  for example )  or naturalism  ( some don't want us to progress freely ,  and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth )  or fear/reason  ( some believe we aren't ready for advanced science/technology since we might destroy ourselves )  .  but cabal  ( the president of the council )  has an answer to the problem of danger :   " our {scientific} revolution did not abolish death or danger .  it simply made death and danger worth while "   ( screenplay )  . 
h . g .  wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by .  he was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour .  at the very beginning of the 20th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species ,  natural biology ,  on one side ,  and marxism ,  market economy on the other side ,  were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number .  the weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite .  he defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race .  first of all the non-caucasian ,  with the only exception of the jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages .  then ,  within the caucasian community all those who were not healthy ,  the alcoholics ,  the mentally disabled ,  all those who were genetically disabled ,  etc .  that was not hitler .  that was h . g .  wells and that was not after the first world war .  that was more than ten years before .  and twenty years before the first world war he had published the time machine that defended the idea that the human  " race "  ,  left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth ,  would see the differentiation of the human  " race "  into two  " species "  :  the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species .  the point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators .  wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy .  the first countries to follow this injunction were the scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them .  the film here proposes a vision of 2036 with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election ,  no parliament ,  no really democratic institution ,  only peace imposed by military conquest ,  and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors .  and in that future world all ,  absolutely all human beings are caucasians .  wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036 .  amazing .  wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all .  the last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets .  frightening .  and that was produced in 1936 .  all the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of hitlerism ,  fascism ,  japanese imperialism or stalinism can be found .  but it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of h . g .  wells .  we are obviously very far away from the brave new world of absolute  " democratic "  social selection ,  or the animal farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat ,  or the 1984 of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of big brother .  this vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others .  and i only want to compare wells with the british science fiction writers of his days .  it would be unfair to go beyond .  this reveals that in england in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals :  the fear that the future would only be somber ,  bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind .   dr jacques coulardeau ,  university paris dauphine ,  university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
i first saw this film 40 years ago on n . y .  television ,  and thought it was a depressing look at the future .  wells sees restriction of private freedoms as a good thing .   (  "  no private airplanes "  .  the 30 year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to british film goers doing the war .  the concept of the future ,  and the korda an co .  concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film .  the very best acting performance is that of ralph richardson as the boss .  a combination of winston churchill and edina from absolutely fabulous comedy series .  it is interesting to note that the boss's negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time churchill . 
saw it first in 1975 on some german tv channel and was hooked immediately ,  afterwards i saw this movie around 12 times in cinemas and nowadays i have a videotape which i watch at least once a year - this movie is excellent in every aspect  ( direction ,  acting ,  cut ,  musical score .  .  .  )  .  the sets are outstanding and very impressive ,  the idea of a devastating world war starting in the late thirties seems like prophecy for a 1936 film ,  the dictator of  " everytown "  is pure mussolini and raymond massey is just charming ,  believable and ideally cast as  " the hero "  .  the positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing by todays usually pessimistic standards - especially the finishing scene which always brings a tear or two to my eyes ,  even after watching the film so many times .   this movie is good on tv but it was made for the big screen ,  so if you have an opportunity to see it in some cinema .  please do ,  it's overwhelming . 
i think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed ,  with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax .  what cinema goers made of this in the 30s ,  i can only imagine .  the 'times' said at the time ,  'a miracle has come to the screen . ' watch it and marvel . 
things to come is an early sci-fi film that shows an imagined world ,  or  " everytown "  through 100 years .  you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts .  the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the  " boss "  wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again ,  after everytown was bombed and war broke out .   this film only has about 3 faults :  it's audio is muddy and video had some quirks ,  the characters aren't deep at all ,  and the overall plot isn't altogether solid .  the plot is lacking something that i can't put my finger on .  .  .  it just seems a little  " fluffy .  "  but if you love sci-fi and are interested in what h . g .  wells though might happened in the next hundred years ,  this is a must see .  it's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing :  a long ,  drawn-out war ,  because they were just about to go to war with germany ,  and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything .   things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once . 
i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world saga chronicling the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth vadar but even today 20 years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with .  in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky princess leia ,  the rougish han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains ,  the sinister darth vadar .  in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen .  he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat .  return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of time .   when the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse .  vadar it seemed had won the day .  how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow ?  in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from han's daring rescue from jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and vadar as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his father's soul .   old friends like the smooth talking lando calrissian and the ever lovable chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself  (  played by the brilliant ian mcdiarmiud . how he missed out on an oscar is a mystery .  )  desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means betraying his apprentice darth vadar . all in black with his red eyes , ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed master of the events that unfold .  his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the empire's reign for good .    lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted .  we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of endor with the help of some adorable ewoks  (  who i really do not believe take from the movie at all .  in fact i feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the death star )  and hindered by legions of stormtroopers and imperial officers .  we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all .  and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father back .   but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar .  for rotj is a battle of emotions and feelings .  vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke .  never did i think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on vadar's face during the final scenes as the emporer turns on luke .  there is more depth and emotion to vadar than i believed a villain ,  especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible .  he is conflicted .  the apprentice as much as the master .  the victim as much as the villain .  without ruining the end too much vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy .   so in conclusion what can i say .  george lucas is the master of the saga .  star wars is the most compelling and engaging sagas i've seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it .  return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves .  it's action ,  suspense ,  romance ,  tragedy ,  redemption ,  joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters ,  wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of . 
the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses ;  the mythical city of everytown in 1940 represents england in general ,  but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world .  when war finally does arrive ,  it's ravages continue not for another five years ,  but until 1966 at which time everytown is completely destroyed .  adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the  " wandering sickness "  ,  a pestilence that continues for another four years .    " things to come "  balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view ,  where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization .  the  " wings over the world "  concept plays out a bit corny ,  though it's spokesman cabal  ( raymond massey )  is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause .  if he fails ,  others will follow .  this message is continually reinforced throughout the film ,  brought home convincingly in massey's end of movie speech .  man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an  " all the universe or nothing "  mindset .   the film's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film  " metropolis "  .  as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036 ,  the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord ,  as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition .  where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon ,  but in 1936 ,  a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969 .    " things to come "  is one of those rarities in film ,  a picture that makes you think .  which side will you come down on ,  the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo ?  it's not a comfortable question ,  as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes .  those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control . 
i never saw this movie until i bought the tape last year .  i was enthralled and entertained .  it has all the elements of what i love to see in a sci-fi story ,  in a book or on the screen .  there's social commentary ,  speculation ,  and a good story .   there's something eerie ,  and amusing ,  watching a 1936 view of the 'distant future' of the 60s and 70s .   i think it's a must see ,  and not only for sci-fiers . 
 " things to come "  movie review by kwrice  here is another wonder filled science fiction film from a different time and place .  it is a film i've only seen in truncated parts ,  but art should be taken as a whole .  i experienced this film as it was designed ,  in a darkened theatre ,  on a silver screen ,  with whirling reels of film and an audience to share it with .  that audience and myself were effected by this film !  one woman who lived through ww ii was choked up by the remembered ravages of war and replenished by the positive ,  albeit corny ,  ending .   the things that caught my attention from the beginning were the initial credits .  the first thing we see is  " h . g .  wells "  in bold angular block copy much like the  " superman "  of yore .  it is not the film title ,  but the creator's title ,  and then before any other humans ,  such as actors or production ,  are listed ,  the director william cameron menzies is up there !  who ?  you've probably seen his work before ,   " around the world in 80 days ,  "   " pride of the yankees ,  "  and  " gone with the wind .  "  he did not direct after this sci-fi epic opera he and mr .  wells created ,  but his film imagery ,  sets ,  and design are very recognizable .   that imagery is very effecting .  i recognized images from many other films ,  that have paid homage to this classic .  the recent  " hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy "  is obvious ,  along with bugs bunny ,   " fantasia ,  "   " monty python and the holy grail ,  "   " sky captain & the world of tomorrow ,  "   " night of the living dead "  and more that i know of ,  but which titles escape me .  this is real special effects here ,  scenes now done with cgi are done with actors ,  big sets ,  and detailed models .  this film was made in 1936 ,  and it's obvious it meant something to the other auteurs .  wells and menzies also worked with bliss ,  doing the music ,  and korda ,  the producer ,  to create a masterpiece with message ,  warning ,  and sermon .   the lines the shakespearean actors cedric hardwicke ,  ralph richardson and raymond massey speak ,  sometimes sound preachy ,  but i also heard lines i still hear now .   " these toys children have nowadays are nothing like i had when i was child ,  "   " it'll help develop their coordination ,  "   " what do we need books for ,  what do we need to read for ?  "  ,   " we don't need cars ,  there's nowhere to go ,  we have all we need right here ,  "   " there will be no war .  "  but war there is !  the naive citizens of  " everytown "  refuse to see the literal writing on the wall .  the never-ending war explodes christmas eve .  the little boy wanting to be a good soldier like his daddy is an image that will likely always stay with me .  this is the world of 1936 that wore blinders to hitler's appeasement .  this war does not end .  the poison gas of the aerial wars segues into the second act .   it is another dark age .  no government ,  no services ,  and people carried along and cheering the war that no one remembers anything about .  plague ,  warlords and bullying to get the planes flying for fuel that no longer exists .  loved ones are shot in the street ,  before they can carry the plague to another .  midway there is a marvelous vignette about the rolls royce ,  that is a much needed respite mid-way .  into this lands a futuristic plane that heralds the future .   that future is the third act .  the world has rebuilt itself with the help of that  " puny animal ,  man .  "  helicopters fly in this film ,  before they were even invented .  the plumber's helper has other uses than the dalek's or glenn miller's .  wide screen plasma screens beguiling the masses ,  and orators inciting the people to tear it all down .   " beware the concussion ,  you have been warned !  "  ,  the city father warns the riotous populace .  so be warned ,  this film might hit you like it hit me .  there are some cute miscues and miscalculations ,  but the thought provoking idealism is what is really worth pondering again ,  and i do want to see this artful film again .  others criticize mr .  wells vision .  it is very easy to work with 20/20 hindsight regarding things ,  costumes and foley miscues .  i believe mr .  wells'  " things to come "  is not about things ,  but is actually about concepts ,  social trends ,  and philosophical ideals .  besides ,  we are now just beginning the new millennium and are not in the time still to come .  this is not cheap cardboard british science fiction ,  but worthwhile epic filmed opera ,  sans singing ,  that as a whole concept overcomes some minor dated shortcomings . 
aside from the great movie metropolis ,  this is about the oldest pure sci-fi movie .  while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad ,  it is a great film for two reasons .  first ,  it is extremely original in both style and content .  even in the 21st century ,  there are no films i can think of that are anything like it .  second ,  for its time ,  the special effects were absolutely incredible--using matte paintings ,  models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow .  sure ,  you could sit back and knock the film because ,  by today's standards ,  the effects are only so-so .  but ,  you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences .  in many ways ,  the sets look highly reminiscent of the  " modern cities "  featured at the 1939 world's fair .   i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question  " are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness ?  "  the end result seems to be a little of both !  how true !   a final note :  i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video .  all three times the sound and print quality stank--particularly the sound .  if this is available on a dvd ,  hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning .  as the sound on the video kept cutting out ,  i really would have appreciated this ! 
things to come is that rarity of rarities ,  a film about ideas .  many films present a vision of the future ,  but few attempt to show us how that future came about .  the first part of the film ,  when war comes to everytown ,  is short but powerful .   ( ironically ,  film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking england--appeasement was at its height .  wells' prediction was borne out all too soon .  )  the montage of endless war that follows ,  while marred by sub-par model work ,  is most effective .  the explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of german expressionist graphic design .  the art director was the great william cameron menzies ,  and his sets of the ruins of everytown are among his best work .  margaretta scott is very seductive as the chief's mistress .  the everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design .  the acting in the 21st century story is not compelling--perhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970 .  unfortunately ,  the model work ,  representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways ,  is laughably bad and could have been done much better ,  even with 30s technology .  this is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing .  this is redeemed by raymond massey's magnificent speech that concludes the film--rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well .  massey's final question is more relevant now than ever ,  in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight .  the scene is aided by the stirring music of sir arthur bliss ,  whose last name i proudly share .   unfortunately ,  the vhs versions of this film are absolutely horrible ,  with serious technical problems .  most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038 .  i hope a good dvd exists of the entire film . 
i must admit a slight disappointment with this film ;  i had read a lot about how spectacular it was ,  yet the actual futuristic sequences ,  the age of science ,  take up a very small amount of the film .  the sets and are excellent when we get to them ,  and there are some startling images ,  but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards .  .  .   much the best drama of the piece is in the mid-section ,  and then it plays as melodrama ,  arising from the 'high concept' science-fiction nature of it all ,  and insufficiently robust dialogue .  there is far more human life in this part though ,  with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over-the-top as the small dictator ,  the  " boss "  of the everytown .  i loved richardson's mannerisms and curt delivery of lines ,  dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond massey's aloof ,  confident visitor .  this boss is a posturing ,  convincingly deluded figure ,  unable to realise the small-fry nature of his kingdom .  .  .  it's not a great role ,  yet richardson makes a lot of it .   everytown itself is presumably meant to be england ,  or at least an english town fairly representative of england .  interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things ;  the 'things to come' seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal ,  but to just go on and on .  there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section ,  concerning more personal 'life' ,  yet one is left quite unsatisfied .  the film hasn't got much interest in subtle complexities ;  it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle ,  blunt moralism ,  every time .  and ,  of course ,  recall the hedged-bet finale :  raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are !    concerning the question of the film being a prediction :  i must say it's not at all bad as such ,  considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right .  the grander conceptions have something to them ;  a war in 1940 ,  well that was perhaps predictable .  .  .  lasting nearly 30 years ,  mind !  ?  a nuclear bomb - the  " super gun "  or some such contraption - in 2036 .  .  .  a technocratic socialist  " we don't believe in independent nation states " -type government ,  in britain ,  after 1970 .  .  .  hmmm ,  sadly nowhere near on that one ,  chaps !   ; - )  no real politics are gone into here which is a shame ;  all that surfaces is a very laudable anti-war sentiment .  generally ,  it is assumed that dictatorship - whether boneheaded-luddite-fascist ,  as under the boss ,  or all-hands-to-the-pump scientific socialism - will *be the deal* ,  and these implications are not broached .  .  .  while we must remember that in 1936 ,  there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out - or even how they were turning out - the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers' vision on other matters .   much of the earlier stuff should - and could - have been cut in my opinion ;  only the briefest stuff from '1940' would have been necessary ,  yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous ,  and it is ages before we get to the richardson-massey parts .  i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott ;  who is just a trifle sceptical ,  cutting a flashing-eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose .  the character is not explored ,  or frankly explained or exploited ,  except for one scene which i shall not spoil ,  and her relationship with the boss isn't explored ;  but then this was the 1930s ,  and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then .  edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles ;  more so in the first as a hapless chap ,  praying for war ,  only to be bluntly put down by another massey character .  massey himself helps things a lot ,  playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto ,  contrasting well with a largely diffident cast ,  save for richardson ,  and scott and chapman ,  slightly .   i would say that  " things to come "  is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in 1936 ;  one of the few serious british science fiction films to date ,  indeed !  its set  ( piece )  design and harnessing of resources are ravenous ,  marvellous .    yet ,  the script is ultimately over-earnest and ,  at times ,  all over the place .  the direction is prone to a flatness ,  though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion .  the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however ;  respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology ,  and an engaging ,  jerky performance that consistently beguiles .  such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing ;  powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this - they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers ,  great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate .    " things to come "  ,  as it stands ,  is an intriguing oddity ,  well worth perusing ,  yet far short of a  " metropolis "  .  .  .  'tis much as  " silly "  ,  in wells' words ,  as that lang film ,  yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it . 
while a bit preachy on the topic of progress as the saving grace of mankind ,  this is still a stunning film that presages the science-fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another 40 years to arrive on the silver screen .  it predicts the global chaos of wwii ,  but expands on the premise by having the conflict last 30 years ,  and then tells the epic tale of man's struggle out from under the rubble and into the wilds of space .  the acting seems wooden and strangely sterile ,  but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals which must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of the movie's release ,  and which still impress today .  this is a film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the sf genre . 
i first saw this as a child living in east london .  the scars of hitlers luftwaffe were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street .  i remember having nightmares after seeing it .  the odd thing is ,  it really hasn't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in cinema fiction .    apart from a globally destructive war ,  the scale of the machines was badly awry ,  more nano-technology now ,  but overall ,  an excellent and well-crafted work .  it was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then .  i would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts .  however ,  much was right .  mans desire for war ,  mans inhumanity to man .  the means of war as a catalyst for development .    
this early sci-fi masterwork by herbert george wells with music by arthur bliss is a powerful piece of film-making .  adapted from wells' somewhat different work by the author ,  it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of 'peace' .  the structure is that after a contrasted-pair of episodes of normalcy and gathering clouds of war ,  the script allows the war to happen .  two families ,  the cabells and the passworthys disagree about what may happen ;  passworthy takes a hopeful view of civilization's  " automatic "  progress ;  cabell is the thinker ,  the doubter .  their city everytown--obviously london-- becomes wrecked by a war featuring tanks ,  a magnificent war march by bliss ,  and the end of civilization .  the second portion finds people living in the wreckage of what had been the city under a  " boss "  ,  played with bravura by ralph richardson ,  whose woman ,  lovely margaretta scott ,  is as fascinating a dreamer as he is a concrete-bound dictator type .  he is trying to rebuild old wwi airplanes so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom ;  a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planes--etc . --everlastingly ;  this is wells' comment on war versus progress .  the survivors are subject to a plague called  " the wandering sickness "  also .  enter a modern flying machine piloted by the cabell of the first section of the film ,  now part of wings over the world ,  an international scientists' coalition ,  who are planning to end warfare forever .  this flight-suited modernist has fascinating conversations with the boss and his woman ,  their attraction being evident ;  then boss sends up his aircraft against them ,  the scientists come with huge numbers of planes and drop the  " gas of peace "  onto the ruins of everytown .  only the boss dies ,  fighting too hard against the pacifying .  the film then shows ore being mined and by slow steps being made into the girders of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers .  in section three ,  a future cabell argues with a future passworthy over the morality of human science .  passworthy wonders if they have a right to send men to the moon ;  cabell champions man's right to advancement and the need to expand his horizons .  the son of passworthy and cabell's daughter ,  are the astronauts being sent .  theotocopulos ,  a religious-minded luddite ,  makes a fiery speech on a huge screen in the city's forum and leads an attack on the 'space gun' that is to fire the new rocket free of earth's gravity .  the climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully ;  the denouement and ending is a speech by cabell praising worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned .   " it is all the universe--or nothing !  "  cabell tells passworthy .   " which shall it be ?  "  as cabell ,  raymond massey gives perhaps his greatest screen performance ;  he is thoughtful ,  compassionate ,  and reasonable ,  a true scientist .  as the rabble-rouser who wants to end the age of science ,  cedric hardwicke is perfect and powerful .  edward chapman playing passworthy does admirably impersonating the voice of convention and fear .  the storyline is logical ,  frequently beautiful and always interesting .  given the near-extinction of mankind ,  the idea of a civilization run by rebuilder scientists is rendered plausible and credible to the viewer .  this is a triumph for the director ,  william cameron menzies ,  for bliss and for all concerned .  listen to the dialogue with someone you love ;  within its constructed limits ,  this is a thinking man's drama debating two possible human futures--progress or its reactionary opposite . 
just a note to add to the above comment .  fear of a black hat doesn't have the criminal who's image has been ripped off by the band ,  that's in cb4 .  easily confused as the two films are so similar ,  but black hat is vastly the superior of the two .  .  .  .  .  yeah . 
after ''empire strikes back'' ''return of the jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the star wars series .   luke went to tattoine to save han solo from jabba .  at the same time ,  the galactic empire is doing in secret ,  the construction of a new space station like the previous death star .  if this station stays totally constructed ,  it will be the end of the rebel alliance .  both vader and the emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new death star , and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule .   r2 and c3po are inside jabba's palace to send a message from luke to jabba , where lukes pretends to negotiate han's life .  he gives r2 and c3po as a gift to jabba as part of his plan .  jabba does not accept the negotiation , since he is using han solo as a piece of his palace's decoration .  ( han still is frozen in carbonite )  lando is hidden as jabba's guard and chewbacca is also gave to jabba by a reward hunter .  when the same hunter tries to save han solo and makes him stay in human form again ,  we see that is actually princess leia in a disguise .  the problem is that jabba discovers leia's plan and takes her as his slave , while han is thrown away in chewbacca's cell .   luke comes as a jedi knight to rescue his friends .  at his first try to kill jabba , he falls into jabba's monster cell  ( bantha )  , but easily kills it .  jabba stays angry and decides to thrown han , chewbacca and luke to sarlacc ,  a big creature from the desert who stays 1 . 000 years digesting it's 'food' .  luke , han and chewie has success in scape again ,  and even boba fett dies when han accidentally throws him in to sarlacc's mouth .  leia kills jabba and goes after han , luke and chewie as well c3po and r2 .    everybody's safe again , luke decides to go to dagoba to complete his training as a jedi , as well his promise to yoda .  the problem is that yoda is too old and sick ,  since he already has 900 years old ,  and before he dies ,  yoda says to luke that he does not need more training , but to really be a jedi ,  he must fight with vader again .  he confirms to luke that vader is luke's dad ,  and that there is another skywalker besides luke .  in his last moments ,  yoda asks to luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side ,  and to luke transmit his jedi knowledge to other people .  when yoda dies , obi wan's spirit shows up to luke and tells him that luke's father killed his good side anakin to become darth vader ,  and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith .  luke stays worried about killing his own dad ,  and says that he feels that his father still has kindness .  obi wan tells luke that his twin sister is leia ,  and says the reasons why luke and leia were separated since babies .  he gives his last advice to luke saying that if he refuses to kill vader ,  the emperor will win the war .   at the same time ,  the emperor says to vader that he must give luke to him when he shows up ,  since luke is stronger than before ,  and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring luke to the dark side .   now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series , when the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station ,  the '' death star 2'' ,  luke will confront vader and the emperor ,  and leia ,  han and chewie needs to turn off the 'death star 2' power field ,  with the help of the ewoks .   ( little creatures who looks little bears )   this is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all ! 
  if you like rap or hip-hop ,  watch this movie ,  although it's funny if you don't get the references ,  as a straight comedy .   haven't seen much of the much hyped cb4 ,  but what i did see didn't have the heart that this little stormer has .   haven't heard from the people involved since ,  which is a surprise .  the film is very similar to spinal tap ,  which is no bad thing ,  and i think a lot of the dialogue ,  while priceless in tap is funnier here ,  probably because i'm more into rap than rock theses days ,  so my own judgment does cloud that point .   the rap songs are funny as hell ,  and it's basically spot the reference for most of the film ,  not all of them are in-your-face ,  which means the physical comedy and the one-liners get priority over the take-offs .   great fun ,  one to watch twice if there ever was a movie . 
i don't remember when i first heard about this movie ,  but i rented it about six years ago ,  and it still remains one of my favorite comedies .  i will admit ,  you probably will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music .  but if you are a rap fan ,  even a casual one ,  you will love the inside jokes and references .  one of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a b**** and a h** ;  i still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it .  one of the best performances comes from larry scott ,  who played nerd lamar in `revenge of the nerds' .  it is unfortunate that this movie will likely never get a dvd release . 
well i don't personally like rap ,  but i still found fear of a black hat hilarious .  i'm sure i didn't get some inside jokes ,  but some i knew ,  and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after i'd stopped laughing .  i'm a big fan of spinal tap ,  so naturally i had to check this out .  it was deriviative from this is spinal tap ,  sometimes blatantly ,  but this film still stood on it's own as an original ,  intelligent ,  and funny satire .  my personal favorite :   " back in the time of slaves ,  they didn't have hats to protect them from the sun ,  so at the end of the day they were too tired to revolt .  now we have hats .  " 
 .   .   .  is just as good as the original .  very nearly achieves greatness because of cundieff's remarkable ear for music and dialogue .  skewers the self-important swagger of the hip-hop poseurs .  the group  " niggaz with hats "   ( nwh )  are every rap group you ever heard and utterly self-parodic .  wardrobe is unbelievable .  buy the oop soundtrack if you can . 
i am shocked .  shocked and dismayed that the 428 of you imdb users who voted before me have not given this film a rating of higher than 7 .  7 ?  !  ?  ?  - that's a c !  .  if i could give fobh a 20 ,  i'd gladly do it .  this film ranks high atop the pantheon of modern comedy ,  alongside half baked and mallrats ,  as one of the most hilarious films of all time .  if you know _anything_ about rap music - you must see this !  !  if you know nothing about rap music - learn something !  ,  and then see this !  comparisons to 'spinal tap' fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film .  if you liked bob roberts ,  you'll love this .  watch it and vote it a 10 ! 
this movie is a great mocumentary .  it follows the rap group ,  nwh ,  made up of ice cold ,  tasty taste and tone def through their unique path to gangster rap highs ,  lows and back to highs .  through trouble with women ,  egos ,  cops and whitey ,  this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world ,  as this movie goes to the top of mocumentaries .  i know everybodies favorite mocumentary is this is spinal tap ,  for very good reason ,  however i think that if in the right mood ,  this movie is simply better .  the laughs never end ,  even for someone not into the rap culture .   i'm a white guy ,  that has no interest in rap music ,  culture or anything else associated with it ,  however i love this movie .  rusty cundeif ,  who wrote the screenplay ,  songs and starred in it showed great potential and it is a shame that i haven't seen him since fear of a black hat .  however ,  i have seen him one more time than you have ,  and is that ,  that i recommend fear of a black hat to you for quick laughs .   remember ,   " don't shoot to you see the whites !  .  .  .  . of their eyes ?  no don't shoot to you see the whites .  "   fym and enjoy the movie . 
if you like cb4 ,  you have no idea what you're missing if you haven't seen this film yet .  this movie is crazy hilarious ,  and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie .  .  .  it is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody i've ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy .  if you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old-school performers ,  definitley rent this movie .  there aren't that many video rental places that have copies of it ,  but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed . 
cb4 was awful ,  but it may have given cundieff the idea to it better .  more like spinal tap than anything else ,  the film is clever from the start .  surprising anyone who saw it back in the mid nineties .  the performances are played for laughs but not so much so that they are cartoon characters ,  more like marx brothers .  these guys are real and slightly diverse .  they react to situations like any of us might .  well ,  we may not throw a tantrum when our performance hats are late to the gig ,  or pull guns and beat down a record company exec ,  but you get the picture .  n ( n***as )  w ( with )  h ( hats )  takes itself seriously enough to reel you in ,  then you're hooked .  rent or get this at all costs ,  even if you're not really into rap music ,  this will still leave you gassing out loud .  comparing this to cb4 is like comparing george lucas' star wars to gil gerards'buck rogers' i think you see my point
 " fear of a black hat "  is a superbly crafted film .  i was laughing almost continuously from start to finish .  if you have the means ,  i highly recommend viewing this movie it is ,  by far ,  the funniest movie i have had the pleasure to experience .  grab your stuff ! 
i first saw this movie on some movie channel  ( hbo ?  )  some time ago .  i was a fan of public enemy ,  nwa and other early rap and had seen cb4 in theaters .  anyway ,  the promo for it caught my eye ,  and i wanted to see what it was all about .  well ,  right off the bat i knew it was going to be good  ( warning !  )  and i was right .  the parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over  ( my peanuts )  ,  but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great .  you've got to love the satire of rap groups  ( obviously nwa )  ,  certain rappers  ( eazy e ,  flava flav ,  ice cube )  ,  and the humor of the three members of nwh .  who can forget tone deaf scratching with his ass ?  it's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved ,  as it was overshadowed by cb4 during their releases ,  but in my opinion is a much better film .  if you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap ,  you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time .  if you aren't into or don't like 'rap' ,  you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre . 
thanks to kevin smith ,  a bunch of geeks are running around saying that return of the jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun to watch .  and oh no !  muppets are involved !  that makes it bad !  everyone liked return of the jedi until someone in a kevin smith movie made a negative comment about it .  now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it .  this movie is so much better than anything kevin smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it .  this movie is good fun !  it's just as awesome as i remember it being when i was six !  enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing kevin smith's opinions !  his aren't correct !   and that ewok song at the end ruled !  i bet you people don't even enjoy  " ewoks :  battle for endor "  !  !  !  !  i'm going to set you all on fire ! 
i picked up the movie with no cover and not even knowing what it was ,  but when i watched it i laughed so hard .  it is now one of my favorite movies of all time .  rusty and the guys created a masterpiece i would highly recommend this movie to any one with a sense of humor .  thank you rusty for giving us something to laugh at . 
chances are ,  you'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it .  but if ,  by chance ,  you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time  ( i'm well into the hundreds by now )  ,  you will find yourself spitting a line from it here and there and cracking yourself up !  my friends and i have actually thrown fear of a black hat parties to get more of our friends ,   " as they say ,  down with the riots "  . 
its too bad that no one knows anything about this movie ,  and it gets old telling people it's rap's version of spinal tap .  and you know ,  im sorry i dont have any better comments ,  but damnit ,  go get the movie and watch it ,  and then make all your friends watch it too ,  just like im gonna . 
having seen both  " fear of a black hat "  and  " this is spinal tap "  ,  i can honestly state that while similar ,  both movies are truly must see .  there will be many times in  " fear "  that will have you in hysterics .  it is no wonder why both movies have such a huge cult following .   " fear "  will soon be available on dvd .  rent it if you must ,  but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself . 
i first saw this movie about 4 years ago and i was expecting something funny ,  similar to cb4 .  i was blown away .  i was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great .  way better than cb4 ,  the characters ,  the songs ,  the plot ,  everything .  top notch independent film that was given  " two thumbs up "  by siskel and egbert  ( and if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick ,  you know it's good )  . 
i cannot stop saying how much i loved this movie .  this movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies i have ever seen .  the movie follows the exploits of a rap group ,  nwh  ( ni#$%rs with hats )  it goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group ,  after it's tragic break up .  following the group is documentary maker nina blackburn .    the movie is on a shoestring budget ,  but it does not seem to matter ,  this is a very well made ,  well produced film and the performances by all of these actors and actresses are excellent .  the main strength of this movie is the writing ,  there are so many brilliant lines and takeoffs on rap in this movie ,  it is unreal .    spoiler  there are takeoffs on actual rappers ,  like mc slammer ,  vanilla sherbert ,  ice cold ,  tone def ,  tastey-taste ,  and songs  ( booty juice ,  grab your dick ,  etc .  )  rusty condieff has made an excellent film .  in the movie he plays rapper ice cold .  the movie does not quit ,  it is funny from the beginning to the end .    the movie works so well because it becomes outlandish on occasion ,  but it strikes that line where it is funny without going too far out there .  listening to the three leads try to talk some kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie ,  like tone def telling a record producer ,  when you take the bus ,  you get there' ,  and the producer responding ,  that's deep ! '  the group portraying n . w . h .  has some sort of natural chemistry to them .  they work so well together ,  and they manage to pull this movie of to where there is not a week moment in the film .  what really makes this movie so good is how true to some of the rap groups of the time this movie is .  many rap groups had problems with violence ,  with censors ,  and like nwa ,  the group only became popular when the establishment began to make a big deal out of the controversial lyrics .   i like this movie because it is offensive .  there is something here to offend everyone in a good natured way .  the movie has a takeoff on a good number of people too outside of rap ,  the funniest being of spike lee .  where they came up with this dialogue i cannot imagine .  the movie has line after line that will have you rolling on the floor .  as i said before the writing is just excellent .   i am not surprised that this movie met such limited release .  it is an intelligent ,  controversial ,  and even thought provoking film .  this is too much for mainstream ,  despite the fact it is hilarious ,  and nearly flawless in it's production .  there are no major stars ,  but a lot of familiar faces ,  including marc lawrence ,  who plays tone def .  watch this movie ,  at the very least you will definitely have an opinion of it . 
fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of hip-hop culture .  it is just as funny as this is spinal tap ,  if not funnier .  the actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb .  mark christopher lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in a lot more films .  this film is a true cult classic ! 
i have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture ,  i'm white and like classic rock ,  however ,  that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy .  its pretty much a sequel of this is spinal tap in the sense that it is the same movie ,  just about rap instead or rock .  yet it's hilarious .  there are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat .  the characters are all very funny and believable .  i watched just because it made me laugh at 3 a . m .  ,  and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening .  one of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different .  rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent .  this movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit .  overall ,  it's a funny movie with many jokes about racism ,  sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor .  this is highly recommend for any fan of this is spinal tap .  they are essentially the same movie ,  just about different worlds ,  and yes ,  the same jokes work in both movies . 
i first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it is still funny .  i don't know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90's ,  but it helps if you do .  in the 90's when nwa and public enemy were at the top ,  there were internal strife within the groups and members when their separated ways  ( ice cube ,  easy e ,  etc )  .  also there were the wanna b's ,  accessible rappers that start making the scene  ( vanilla ice ,  freedom williams from c&c music factory ,  etc )  .  this movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like it's an actually documentary .  kasi lemmons plays an interviewer that spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name n . w . h .  the members of the group are ice code  ( rusty condieff/director )  ,  tasty taste  ( larry b scott/revenge of the nerds ,  and tone def  ( mark christopher lawrence )  .  they are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial .  whats good about this film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of the hiphop industry of the 80s and they way it pokes fun at it .  but ,  if you know 80's/90's rap ,  you know how much of this stuff is true .  still ,  on it's own ,  without hip hop knowledge ,  it is still a funny funny movie .  and for all of those who ask ,  yes spinal tap came first ,  but spinal tap is not the first spoof movie either .  this ,  in my opinion is equally as funny and in some ways ,  better than spinal tap .  as spinal tap is to heavy metal ,  fear of a black planet is to rap .  and the songs are off the hook also .  the dvd is chalk full of extras to include music videos of nwh as a group and as solo artists .  brilliant performances by rusty condieff and larry b scott . 
my ,  kasi lemmings certainly is a fair looking woman .  this film is a lost gem ,  a dead-on satire  " mockumentary "  of the early 90's hip hop scene ,  when mc hammer had just began to fade away into that good night .  we follow the three members of the nwh as they embark upon their picaresque journey of would-be riches and fame .  and like nickolas nickleby ,  at the end ,  they finish their journey not far from where they started ,  but at least a little wiser and lot less naive .  this is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of ,  but it's the kind of film you either love or hate ,  a lot like  " company man "  in this regard .  i regard this movie like the 1000 islands of upstate new york :  it's a wonderful little secret you want to keep to yourself . 
i saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white ,  educated ,  and urban .  the showing i attended had a sprinkling of african-americans ,  and it made the difference in audience-reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country .  basically ,  the white folks were afraid to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bits --and there are many !  -- because they'd be  " laughting at blacks "  ,  while the blacks also stayed pretty silent because many couldn't laugh at themselves in front of the whites .    i ,  on the other hand ,  being asian  ( and thus belonging to neither group )  ,  had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its egos/trappings/values/pseudo-philosophies .  the cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed .  the songs are too funny to be believed .   this film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries to come along ,  including  " a mighty wind " 
i've just read the most recent remarks about this movie and i would like to respond .  you're probably not familiar with the original story of rap group n . w . a .  which dates back to the beginning in 1988 ,  in 1989 ice cube left the band to go solo and ultimately in 1991 ,  the band breaking up when dr . dre left .  which led to a lot of beef starting with the departure of ice cube and dr . dre in 1991 .  this story was somewhat based on that .   further more this movie was a 90 minute laughing spree ,  the way they explained the bootie juice song to be a political statement was hilarious .  not to mention the  " love song "  tasty was hooking up .  and when vanilla sherbert got his ass kicked ,  just like the record company executive is also hilarious and having they're managers getting shot every time too .   people who didn't enjoy this movie probably didn't get it or were complete idiots ,  my opinion
this is a really funny film ,  especially the second ,  third and fourth time you watch it .  it's a pretty short film ,  and i definitely recommend watching it more than once ,  you will 'get it' more the second time .   it's like spinal tap but the rap version .  it has a lot of attitude in it which can be a negative thing in rap influenced films ,  but it's just a total p**s take and isn't a problem because of the irony it creates .   plenty of stand-out bits ,  one of those types of films which you will find yourself quoting lines with your mates ,  and it will raise laughter .   my personal favourite part is the 'guerrillas in the midst' section .  great video ,  superb ! 
okay ,  my title is kinda lame ,  and almost sells this flick short .  i remember watching siskel & ebert in '94 talking about this movie ,  and then playing a clip or two .  not being a rap-conscious guy  ( although i could identify snoop dogg ,  vanilla ice ,  and mc hammer music )  ,  i wasn't much interested when they started talking about the film .  but then ,  s&e showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name  ( using some  " shady "  logic and a bunch of  " made up "  facts )  ,  and then another scene where the band ,  and their rival band ,  both visit a school to promote getting involved  ( and ,  of course ,  nwh comes up with some  " info "  about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee )  .  so i filed it away that i should see this movie .   a couple of years later ,  this thing shows up on hbo and i recorded it ,  only to laugh my butt off for hours .  yes ,  it has a  " spinal tap "  kind of rhythm to it .  .  . even the documentarist takes essentially the same  " tone "  in setting up the clips ,  and the band follows a similar path  ( what i now call the  " behind the music "  phenomenon - smalltime band has good chemistry ,  gets famous ,  too much money too fast ,  squabbling ,  drugs ,  some type of death ,  band breaks up ,  then reconciles ,  finishing with a hope for more albums in the future ,  and fade to black )  .  the one thing that is true is that in spinal tap ,  you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past .  but tap drags at some points ,  and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes .  oh ,  this is his rant about the backstage food ,  this is spot where he wants the amp to go to  " eleven "  ,  this is the spot where the guy makes the pint-sized stonehenge ,  etc .  .  .   contrasting to foabh ,  which seems to have more  " unexpected "  humor .  you can see some of it coming ,  but there isn't a big setup for every joke .  sometimes ,  the jokes just kinda flow .  cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked .  also ,  the direct references to vanilla ice ,  hammer ,  and a bunch of other caricature-type rappers really worked well .  this strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs ,  and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes .  and the songs .  is  " my peanuts "  better than  " big bottom "   ( from spinal tap )  ?  i don't know - but they're both damn funny .  tone def's awful video during his  " awakening "  phase is so bizarre ,  yet so funny .   i could go on awhile ,  but save your time and don't waste it on cb4 .  i watched the first half hour ,  and got bored .  you don't get bored on foabh .  there are slightly less funny moments ,  but you can never tell when something good is about to happen .  perhaps my favorite scene is when ice cold and tastey taste  ( name ripoffs if i've ever heard any )  discover they've been sharing the same girl .  .  .  . at one point ,  you've got those two pointing guns at each other ,  and the next thing you know ,  the manager ,  the photographer ,  the girl ,  and i think even tone def are in the room pointing guns at each other ,  switching targets back and forth .  and ,  of course ,  someone does get shot .   i did find it odd that nwh's managers suffered similar fates to spinal tap's drummers  ( although none spontaneously combusted ,  i don't think )  .  there were enough similarities that i cannot ignore the likelihood that cundieff saw  " spinal tap "  prior to writing this film ,  although this is clearly much more the spinal tap of hip-hop .  while some similarities exist ,  the humor is different ,  and the movie seems more like a real documentary  ( maybe because we don't recognize a single actor in this thing ,  even the guy who played  " lamar "  from  " revenge of the nerds "  )  .  all in all ,  this movie has ,  in my opinion ,   " street cred "  .  kinda like nwh . 
i'm too old to know  ( or care )  exactly what the difference between rap and hip-hop is .  and ,  being canadian ,  it's likely that i've never actually seen mtv ,  but i'm not certain .   but i thought this film was very funny when i saw it ,  a bright little satire .  hip-hop culture is so pervasive these days that it's difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over .   ( if only we could say the same about bagpipe music .  )  i got most of the jokes  ( at least i think i did )  .  sure ,  it's derived from spinal tap ,  but there are lots of targets that could stand a tap treatment .  just not the carpenters ,  they're sacred . 
after a big tip of the hat to spinal tap ,  this movie is hilarious .  anyone who grew up watching mtv will love it and if you didn't ,  rent it anyway , the  " my peanuts "  and  " a gangster's life "  videos are worth the three bucks alone . 
rated r for strong language , violent content and some nudity .  quebec rating : 13+ canadian home video rating : 14a  fear of a black hat is one of the funniest ,  most original comedies i have ever seen . its basically a gangsta rap version of the film this is spinal tap . its a shame not many people have heard of this gem of a film . if you manage to find this film anywhere don't hesitate to buy it even if you don't like rap music . there are not too many comedy films that i give a perfect 10/10 to . the only ones i can think of at the moment are this film , clerks , the world according to garp , the 40 year old virgin and chasing amy . this film is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta rap culture . the movie is about a woman named nina blackburn who is making a documentary about the fictional rap group n . w . h ( n****z with hats )  . they are basically the stereotype of a rap group making many controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangsta . fear of a black hat is an excellent comedic film and i recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta rap scene . its a shame this film is not in the top 250 .   runtime : 88min   10/10
this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy ,  for a variety of reasons .  however it emerges at the end of the day a winner ,  despite all its flaws .  it's still a very good film ,  even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments .   one problem here is the look of the film ,  which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films .  i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz .  the first 2 films have that dirty ,  lived-in look with all the technology and so forth .  in  " jedi "  on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned .  this makes for a much less textured film .  also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy .  at this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself .   another aspect is its lack of originality .  where  " star wars "  created a whole new experience in cinema and  " empire "  brought us to alien worlds of swamps ,  ice ,  and clouds ,   " jedi "  lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film .  first we are back on the desert planet tatooine ,  and then we are watching them face another death star  ( maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new .  .  .  but you'd think lucas or kasdan could )  .  also we have these ewoks ,  who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears ,  in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of  " star wars "  if they hadn't run out of cash .  it just feels like lazy construction .   the most unfortunate aspect of  " jedi "  for me is the weak handling of the han solo character .  whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time ,  trading one liners with the droids .  instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke -- as if the conclusion of  " empire "  where she confessed her love of him had never happened .  the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue .  ford ,  for his part ,  looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances .  this is more like a 1990s ford performance ,  bored and looking  " above "  the film itself .  fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes .  lando ,  an interesting character introduced in  " empire "  ,  here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle .  only hamill ,  given an interesting development in the luke character ,  is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character .  probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work .  and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters .  really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package .  ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor .  the film would sink if he had been too far over the top  ( as he was at times in the new films )  .   visually and in terms of effects work ,  other than the  " clean "  look of everything it's hard to find fault .  jabba is a very effective animatronic character ,  one of the most elaborate ever constructed .  the space battles towards the end are very impressive .   ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears .  but on its own ,  it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas' later productions . 
 " fear of a black hat "  is everything the  ( much weaker )   " cb-4 "  should have been .  rusty cundieff's satirical eye is ruthless ,  as he folds ,  spindles ,  and mutilates every aspect of hip-hop trends and culture .  does  " foabh "  resemble spinal tap ?  yes ,  a bit .  is it derivative of spinal tap ?  no ,  not really .  the aim is more focused ,  the satire is better focused ,  and to be honest ,  it's funnier . 
okay .  this movie is a pure pleasure .  it has the ever so violent horror mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy .  the dentist really starts to loose his mind and it's enjoyable to watch him do so .  this movie is for certain people ,  though .  either you'll completely love it or you will totally hate it .  a good movie to rent and watch when you don't got anything else to do .  also recommended :  psycho iii
brian yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore-fests ,  but the truth is that his films actually aren't bad at all .  the re-animator sequels aren't as great as the original ,  but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned .  return of the living dead 3 is the best of the series ;  and society isn't a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece .  this thriller certainly isn't a masterpiece ;  but it shows yuzna's eye for horror excellently ,  and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging .  i'm really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didn't turn up until 1996 ,  as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - it's running away from a tiger for the modern world .  dentistry doesn't frighten me ,  but surprisingly ;  i would appear to be in the minority .  the plot follows perfectionist dentist dr feinstone .  he has a nice house ,  a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want .  however ,  his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife's affair with the pool cleaner .  and his life isn't the only one ;  as it's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger .  .  .   when it comes to scaring the audience ,  this movie really makes itself .  however ,  credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme .  the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that i'm not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes !  the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline ,  only with the dentist you always get the impression that there's more to the film than what we're seeing .  it isn't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this won't be winning any awards ,  the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot .  the acting ,  while b-class ,  is actually quite impressive ;  with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge .  i should thank brian yuzna for casting ken foree in the movie .  the dawn of the dead star doesn't get enough work ,  and i really love seeing him in films .  the rest of the cast doesn't massively impress ,  but all do their jobs well enough .  overall ,  the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies .  the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans ,  and i don't hesitate to recommend this film . 
first ,  i'd like to say that ,  while i know my share about star wars ,  i am not a fanatic .  i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427 .  what i know is this :  star wars ,  all the movies ( less so with episode 2 though )  ,  captured something magical .  it's hard to say what ,  what button lucas has found and boldly pressed ,  but it works .  star wars is more than a movie .  it's an idea .   how ,  may you ask ?  i shall explain .  star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes ,  good vs evil .  it does this so obviously ,  so profoundly ,  that literally any person from any environment can understand .  episode vi does the very well ,  concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father ,  yet also ,  with the addition of the prequels ,  reveals even more to the hinted back story .  suddenly ,  it's darth vader at the front ,  and viewers realize that it's the story about anakin ,  not just luke .  but even before 1-3 ,  there was amazing depth to it all .  it felt real ,  as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas's lap ,  detailing a historical account of a galaxy far ,  far away .   star wars is definitely something far above the norm ,  and i must admit ,  whenever i see them ,  particularly this one ,  i feel very small .  i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined .  i get a tingling feeling when i see them ,  a feeling that something ,  somehow ,  has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope . 
when i saw the dentist ,  i thought it was very cool .  but this movie is not for everyone ,  especially people who do not like gory scenes as the dentist has lots of gory scenes .  that's why it has it's r18 rating .  it's about a beverly hills dentist dr alan feinstone ,  who finds his wife brooke cheating on him with the poolman .  it's best to go to your dentist  " before "  you watch this .  but if you don't like going to the dentist already ,  then it's best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life .  the dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that i've ever seen .  who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist  ( spoiler )  pull out all his cheating wife's teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic ?  overall awesome flick ,  but not for everyone . 
as dr .  alan feinstone ,  corbin bernsen turns a marvelously deranged performance in  " the dentist "  .   with his already obsessive compulsive tendencies in high gear ,  the irs hounding him ,  and a very suspicious acting wife ;  dr .  alan feinstone is losing his sanity more and more each day .   when the doc indeed does realize that his wife is having an affair with the local pool boy ,  it sets off a string of events that lead to torture ,  murder ,  ant total mayhem !   " the dentist "  is a solid film !  bernsen makes the character of dr .  feinstone relatable and hateable at the same time .  even though he is completely out of his gourd ,  the audience will still feel sympathy towards him .  that my friends .  .  .  .  . is damn good acting .   a nice solid cast of supporting actors round out this gem of a film .  excellent direction ,  good killings and gore ,  and effective pacing will keep you entertained throughout the movies run .   highly recommended ! 
corbin bernsen gives a terrifically intense and riveting performance as dr .  alan feinstone ,  a wealthy and successful beverly hills dentist who's obsessed with perfection .  when he discovers that his lovely blonde babe trophy wife has been cheating on him and the irs start hounding him about tax problems ,  feinstone cracks under the pressure and goes violently around the bend .  director brian yuzna ,  working from a suitably dark ,  witty and demented script by stuart gordon ,  dennis paoli ,  and charles finch ,  exposes the seething neurosis and psychosis bubbling underneath the squeaky clean well-manicured surface of respectable affluent rich america with deliciously malicious glee .  moreover ,  yuzna further spices up the grisly goings on with a wickedly twisted sense of pitch black gallows humor .  bernsen positively shines as dr .  feinstone ;  he expertly projects a truly unnerving underlying creepiness that's right beneath feinstone's deceptively calm and assured veneer .  the supporting cast are likewise excellent :  linda hoffman as feinstone's bitchy ,  unfaithful wife brooke ,  earl boen as smarmy ,  meddlesome irs agent marvin goldblum ,  molly hagan as feisty assistant jessica ,  patty toy as perky assistant karen ,  jan hoag as jolly office manager candy ,  virginya keehne as sweet ,  gawky teenager sarah ,  ken foree as thorough ,  no-nonsense detective gibbs ,  tony noakes as gibbs' equally shrewd partner detective sunshine ,  michael stadvec as womanizing stud muffin pool cleaner matt ,  and mark ruffalo as on the make sleazeball steve landers .  the first-rate make-up f/x are every bit as gory ,  gross and upsetting as they ought to be .  the polished cinematography by levie isaaks boasts lots of great crazy tilted camera angles and a few tasty zoom-in close-ups .  alan howarth's spirited shuddery score also hits the flesh-crawling spot .  an enjoyably warped treat . 
this movie was very enjoyable ,  though you'll only like it if :  - you hate going to the dentist but aren't afraid of a movie where one of them goes beserk - you love horror movies  i particularly liked the fact that some care was given to explaining the brute actions of the main character .  the fact that he's totally obsessed by cleanliness  ( especially in the mouth )  and then catches his wives providing some oral pleasure to the mud-covered pool-man is a pretty believable reason to go overboard .   liked it .  i give it an 8 . 
the dentist was made on the time when almost every profession had it's psycho .  we had mad police officers ,  ambulance men ,  secretery's and that was just for starters .  the dentist came suprisingly late because going to dentist is usually everyman's nightmare .   the plot is twisted .  super clean dentist doctor feinstone lives perfect life in his great  " white house "  ,  he has beautiful blond wife and great place to work as a dentist .  dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of nasty irs guy  ( terminator's earl boen )  ,  dirty pool cleaner  " cleaning "  his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seems to have gone through dark filter .  he goes nutso and starts to take care of people teeth in the nasty way .  and you don't want to come to his path .   crew were professional .  producer/director brian yuzna had produced stylish horror movies like re-animator and from beyond .  he directed the sequel to re-animator and his first movie society was nice spinoff from john carpenter's they live .  film's producer pierre david is known from movies like scanners .  cast was great .  corbin bernsen really suprised me .  i knew him from la law and major league ,  but i could newer dream him as a psycho dentist .  he was actually great in his role and he was kind of sad person .  linda hoffman was beutiful and dumb as feinstones wife .  micahel stadvec did not have much line's ,  but after i saw him with ladies of the neighbourhood i knew my future profession .  ken foree  ( dawn of the dead ,  from beyond )  was nice sight as cop on the case .  virginya keehne was the innocent teen who is about to be next client to feinstone .   final warning :  if you're like me and have problem with dentist's then maybe you should skip this one .  but if you want to try than you should prepare yourself with dark humor and lots nasty drillings . 
this movie is very great !  the acting is fine ,  with excellent casting of corbin bernsen as the perfectionistic dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients .  in the beginning he sees his wife with the poolman ,  and then he goes crazy .  he also takes revenge on his wife and the poolman ,  beside the patients he tortures .  the most special effects are also beautiful ,  although some are really fake  ( like a drilled-out tongue ,  that has laid for 1 night outside ,  and is still red in the morning )  .  but the torture scenes are absolutely well-done .  though this movie has the weak point that it is very slow ;  between the heavy parts are sometimes just extremiously boring parts .  but for the real horror/thriller-fan this is a must-watch ! 
first it was jack the ripper ,  now it is alan feinstone .  the crazy dentist tortures people in horrific ways .  quite realistic at times but some of the acting is abysmal and comical .  especially from corbin bernson .  in some scenes there is dental torture that will really make you cringe . 
the dentist starts on the morning of dr .  alan feinstone  ( corbin bernsen )  & his wife brooke's  ( linda hoffman )  wedding anniversary .  on the surface mr .  & mrs .  feinstone seem to have a nice life ,  a beautiful home in los angeles & he has a successful career with responsibility but beneath things are very wrong .  alan discovers that brooke is having an affair with matt  ( michael stadvec )  the swimming pool cleaner ,  to add to his humiliation alan then discovers that matt is also having sex with paula roberts  ( lise simms )  one of his next door neighbours & to top it all off he owes the irs ,  who are breathing down his neck ,  a shed load of money .  alan starts to lose his mind ,  he convinces himself that everything is decayed & rotten ,  just like his patient's teeth ,  & it's up to him to fix it .  that morning at work he begins to take his frustrations & anger out on his patients ,  first he injures a young boy named jody  ( brian mclaughlin )  ,  he sexual assault's a patient named april reign  ( christa sauls )  after he hallucinates that she is his wife & deliberately performs an unnecessary & painful procedure on another .  alan also begins to take drugs as he completely loses it & goes homicidal starting with his adulterous wife & pool cleaner .  .  .   directed by brian yuzna i thought the dentist was a good film & tried something a bit different .  the script by dennis paoli ,  stuart gordon & charles finch is more of a psycho thriller than straight slasher which came as a surprise to me as i was expecting the latter ,  it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film like friday the 13th  ( 1980 )  with a high body count & a wise cracking dentist villain but what the dentist actually turned out to be is very different .  the dentist is at heart a character study of one mans descent into madness & it does a fine job although having said that i'm not sure what he goes through is enough justification for his subsequent murderous actions .  it moves along at a nice pace ,  has a nice narrative in which i liked the constant connection alan makes between the decay he sees in his patients & the decay he sees in the world around him & is an entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes .  it goes without saying that anyone with a phobia about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you'll never go again !  i liked the ending too where the tables are turned ,  i'll say no more .  .  .   director yuzna does his usual fine job here ,  in fact i don't think i've seen a yuzna film that i didn't enjoy to some extent ,  he obviously & predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling people's teeth out ,  sexually molesting them ,  performing operations on drugs & torturing people with the dreaded dentist's drill .  there are some other gore scenes as well ,  a dead dog ,  someone gorily slashed with a knife & cut out tongues .  yuzna gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget ,  he likes to tilt his camera which make for some nice angles & i liked the shot where the camera is above someone being knifed & huge sprays of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide overhead angle .   technically the dentist is fine ,  decent cinematography ,  music & production values although some of the special make-up effects look a little unconvincing .  the acting is pretty strong from everyone involved with corbin putting in a good crackpot performance .  the ever cool & genre favourite ken foree turns up as detective gibbs one of los angeles finest .   the dentist didn't turn out like i had expected & all the better for it ,  if your a horror fan & perhaps want something a bit different then this is well worth checking out .  i liked it & think it's definitely worth a watch . 
this is a gory mess and pretty convincing .  corbin bernson is very much in command of this movie with his slick portrayal of the loony control freak eponymous practitioner .  linda hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for her ,  the little  " tryst "  with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best - shame about that pretty smile !  the last half hour of the movie is devoted to bernson's character losing it completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called virginya keehne .  an extremely talented performer ,  she hogs the limelight from the moment the braces come off .  nice legs ,  too ! 
as if most people didn't already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry ,  this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm .  a successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man  ( on their anniversary of all days !  )  and snaps big time into a furious breakdown .  after shooting an attack dog's head off ,  he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his  " slut "  of a wife .  there are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing ,  tongue-cutting ,  and beauty queen fondling ,  as well as a marvelously deranged performance by corbin bernsen .  the scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch .  a dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail .   " the dentist "  is incredibly entertaining ,  fast-paced ,  and laughably gory at times .  check it out ! 
i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies .  i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted .  to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot ,  the most suspense ,  surprises ,  most emotional ,  ( especially the ending )  and definitely the most episodic movie .  i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower-moving ,  was not as episodic ,  and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie .   it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole .  i have heard many strange reasons such as :  a )  because yoda died b )  because bobba fett died c )  because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d )  because darth vader was revealed  i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely .  first off ,  who cares if bobba fett died ?  ?  ?  if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die .  don't get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be .  his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie .  .  .  you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett's name !  !  !  judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think .  .  .  secondly ,  many fans did not like yoda dying .  sure ,  it was a momentous period in the movie .  i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic .  all the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie ,  you know .  otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon .  another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda's death .  .  well ,  nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope .   ( many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy )  why was obi wan's death okay but yoda's not .  .  .  hmmmmmmmmmmmm .  .  .  .  another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible .  that is utterly ridiculous !  !  i can not believe this one !  !  first off ,  the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there .  if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage .   ( since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage )  they had swinging vines ,  ropes ,  logs set up to trip those walkers ,  and other traps .  the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest .  the only thing they had was their blasters .  to add ,  it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves ,  they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest .  i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros ,  the band of rebels ,  as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain ,  that would have been a great upset .  lastly ,  if this scene was still unbelievable to you .  .  how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo ,  chewbacca ,  and the princess ,  being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view !  !  and not only that ,  the heroes  ,  of course ,  always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters .  the troopers must have very ,  very bad aim then !  at least in empire strikes back ,  the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers .  don't believe me ?  check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando's base .  or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at  ( somehow they missed ) as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star .   the last reason that i care to discuss  ( others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here .  )  is that people did not like darth vader being revealed !  well ,  in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie .  luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father ,  annakin skywalker .  it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete .  by annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side  ( in his helmet )  and to the good person he was annakin skywalker  ( by removing the helmet )  .  the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about .  in fact ,  that's is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke's father .  .  . isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet ?   on another note ,  i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse  ( even if it is better )  that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves .  i never go into a film with that deception in mind ,  i always try to go into a film with the attitude that  " well ,  it might be better or worse that the original  .  .  but i can not know for sure .  .  let's see .  "  that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was .   i am not sure who criticizes these movies but ,  i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me  ( except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite )  that it is rotj .  i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading .   bottom line ,  the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy .  this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes .  there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful ,  exciting ,  surprising ,  or all of the above .  for example ,  the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day !  !  !   finally ,  i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky ,  insignificant details  ( or see it as  " just another sequel "  )  to trash the movie such as  " this movie stinks because luke is not in it !  "  then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately .   
i realize this review will get me bashed by the expert film critics patrolling this site ,  but i will defend this film .   the dentist is actually a really good film .  the acting isn't always top notch ,  but the thrills are good and the story's good .  plus you see linda hoffman's boobies .  not that i'm an expert in this field ,  but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense .  corbin makes a great creepy dentist .  it does to dentists what jaws does to sharks .  .  . ish .  it obviously had a fairly limited budget ,  but they did well with it what they could ,  and developed the characters well  ( those that count )  .   the end . 
i remember being terrified of movie blood when i was younger ,  and gradually getting less so ,  until getting jaded enough ,  as i'm sure many other viewers have become ,  so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm .   " the dentist "  turned that around .   the setup seems simple :  a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths ,  and perhaps bodies as well .  a clever twist ,  though ,  is that the dentist is the film's protagonist ,  so instead of being some one-dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation ,  his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable .  the viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims ,  and instead of hoping for justice to come to him ,  i found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life .   what really  " makes "  a horror movie is the violence .  and  " the dentist "  does it better than any other film i can think of .  first off ,  the film has tons of tension ,  which is something that modern gore films tend to lack .  in one scene  (  )  ,  the dentist is emotionally distraught and has to see a young child patient for the first time .  as he reaches into the child's mouth ,  you hope that ,  for the dentist's and the child's sake ,  the encounter ends without injury .  i won't spoil what happens .  second ,  when the gore does come ,  it hits all the worst ,  squirmy nerves .  once again ,  i won't give anything away .   of course ,  being a movie that you've never heard of ,  it does have flaws .  most importantly ,  it's exclusively for horror fans .  also ,  as another reviewer mentioned ,  by taking place over a span of just a few days ,  we don't really get any background on the characters .  and the tension drops a little bit during the very end .  but really ,  the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is ,  and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small lapses in tension can be forgiven .   it's strange ,  after years of being accustomed to movie gore ,  to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood .   " the dentist "  made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable ,  and for this it earns my full approval . 
the brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary .  it's one of man's primal fears .  this movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room .  corbin bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who i guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so it's not really working out .  in a particularly gory scene we find so-so actor earl boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot ,  which i guess is the absolute worst you can do when you're a killer dentist .  it's a typical brian yuzna situation ,  not well written but there's gore .  the plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey ,  it's a killer dentist movie ,  we've all thought of it but they did it first . 
i love this movie .  as a kid ,  this was one of the first movies i saw that made me flinch .  sure ,  it is mild now ,  but back in the day ,  it was awesome .  dentists are one thing so many people fear ,  so why not do a movie about a killer dentist ?  it's cheesy ,  it's fun ,  sometimes it's scary ,  but it is awesome .  and i have always had a love for medical horror .  and corbin bernsen plays dr .  feinstone perfectly ,  no one could have done it better .  and for a low budget horror film ,  the effects and such are quite good .  and i also love the theme music ,  it goes well with the film .  ken foree  ( dawn of the dead )  is also in this one playing a nosy cop ,  and does a fine job .  there is a fair amount of blood ,  and some really cool torture/death scenes .  check this one out ! 
before we begin ,  i have a fear of dentists .  this movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe .  that is what i love about this film .  the movie is kind of boring .  for that ,  i take 3 stars off !   *spoiler alert*  the movie revolves around dr .  alan feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him .  soon ,  he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients ,  killing co-workers ,  and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair with .   *end spoiler*   the movie is very bloody and gory .  i would recommend it if you are into gore .   i give this film 7 stars out of 10 .  dr .  alan feinstein is not your normal everyday dentist ! 
the dentist is a really good thriller .  and pretty disturbing .  i think we can all agree that the chances of running into a psycho dentist are much bigger than running into monsters ,  vampires or zombies .  that's exactly why this movie is so scary .  during this film ,  you'll probably think about your own dentist a few times .  whether he's capable of doing such things .  .  . you better pray his wife doesn't cheat on him .  that's what the story is all about .  a respected dentist in la snaps when he finds out his wife is cheating on him with the pool-boy .   (  that must be the greatest profession in the world ,  by the way .  poolboys always take advantage of the housewives when the husband is at his work )  from then on our dentist ,  dr .  feinstone ,  can only thing about taking revenge .  he can't concentrate on his patients anymore and a couple of them get hurt .  things aren't made easier for our dentist when he's chased by an annoying tax-controller ,  a curious cop and a suspicious staff member of his .  at one point ,  dr .  feinstone can't take it anymore .  now he's not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him .  .  the dentist is written and directed by brian yuzna and co-written by stuart gordon .  you can take that as a recommendation to itself .  these 2 persons already gave us a few great horror movies  (  and personal favorites of mine  )  like re-animator ,  from beyond and society .  with the dentist ,  they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller .  this film came right on time actually .  the decade hadn't brought us many great horror films so far .  i'm not at all saying this is a masterpiece ,  but it's a nice change .  corbin bensen is great as the dentist obsessed by hygiene .  i remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor ,  but he can sure handle a psychotic character .  the rest of the cast does good work too .  the woman who plays feinstone's wife is really attractive .  also ,  it was great to see ken foree acting again .  the actor from my all time favorite movie dawn of the dead plays the cop in this film .  yuzna casted him in from beyond too ,  15 years ago and i thank him for that .  i don't recommend this movie to everyone  ( if you have a weak stomach ,  i'll advise you to skip it )  but if you do watch it ,  you'll enjoy it very much .  you'll be disgusted .  .  . but that's an extra reason ,  i think .  it's been a while since i was really freaked out by watching a film .  it's a great topic to handle in the genre and yuzna does it in a great way .  too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel .  my humble opinion on the dentist  .  .  .  8/10
i'm surprised no-one has thought of doing a movie like this before .  horror is often most effective when it uses real life unpleasantness as a theme .  and nobody  ( except for steve martin in the little shop of horrors )  likes going to the dentist .  tooth torture has been done before  ( see the marathan man for example )  ,  but this brings the terror into suburbia .   the plot revolves around a dentist ,  dr .  alan feinstone  ( corbin bernsen )  ,  who descends into madness .  now our dear doctor wasn't playing with a full deck to begin with ,  but driven by jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder he begins to reek havoc on those around him .  the doctors spiraling mental condition is kinda close to what we see in micheal douglas's character in falling down ,  but with a horror edge .   written and directed by horror stalwarts stuart gordon and brian yuzna ,  its witty and has a great flow .  also featured playing a cop ,  is the ever welcome ken foree .   now i believe this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance from corbin bernsen .  having really only seen him in la law before ,  i was blown away by his acting .   the sequel the dentist 2 is also worth watching ,  but slightly under par compared to the original .   ttkk's bottomline - a fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe ,  capped  ( pun intended )  by a great performance from bernsen
not that many films have truly exploited the fear of going to the dentist that many people have .  those in the profession have some genuinely intimidating looking instruments .  give writers dennis paoli ,  stuart gordon ,  and charles finch for deriving maximum make-you- squirm-in-your-seat shock value from their premise .   corbin bernsen ,  in a nicely nuanced performance ,  is alan feinstone ,  dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the tracks early on .  an unbalanced obsessive-compulsive ,  he starts dwelling on thoughts of decay ,  even imagining it where there isn't any ,  and also equating decay with corruption of society in general .  having witnessed his unfaithful wife brooke  ( linda hoffman )  getting it on with their pool boy ,  he determines to punish her .  at the same time ,  he's under pressure from a smarmy i . r . s .  agent  ( earl boen ,  best known as dr .  silberman from the  " terminator "  franchise )  to do a favor in exchange for the agent keeping his mouth shut about feinstone's financial affairs .  feinstone starts to perceive everybody around him as decayed in one way or another ,  and he goes on a murder spree as police detective gibbs  ( the always welcome ken foree )  picks up his trail .   director brian yuzna clearly has great fun with the script .  it allows for some genuinely nasty and remarkably entertaining gore scenes that do just as well as creating sympathy for the victims as thrilling the audience .  the script gives the feinstone character some fine lines of dialog and is overall quite sly and amusing ,  with large doses of pitch-black humor  ( such as feinstone ordering a victim to  " get their tongue out of the way !  "  )  .  brooke and the i . r . s .  agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes .  the makeup effects are for the most part quite good .  and the film does a fine job of maintaining its forward momentum ,  as feinstone ,  with his relentless drive for perfection ,  switches from respected professional to unhinged killer in record time .   foree ,  always cool and fun to watch ,  is rather wasted in a standard-issue detective role ,  but there's some enjoyment in watching boen play his slimeball part to the hilt .  hoffman and christa sauls provide very appealing eye candy .  and a pre-fame mark ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role .  but this is all very much bernsen's show as he sinks his teeth  ( pardon me for using that expression )  into his plum leading part with total conviction .    " the dentist "  ranks as one of the more original and interesting horror films to come out of the 1990's .   8/10
this would have been so much fun to see in a theater ,  back in 1996 .  there is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies .    " the dentist "  is panned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters .  maybe the ada launched a campaign against it ,  since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for  " the marathon man "   ( which only has one scene comparable to the many in  " the dentist "  )  .   it's amazing to note that according to the trivia page ,  the movie was shot in 21 days .  of course ,  post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for  " the dentist "  is picture perfect .  the quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist  " takes care "  of his wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening .  the rest is left to our very fertile imaginations !  corbin bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has lots of experience playing psychologically  " off "  characters and he completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist .   for me the pacing of the movie was just right .  the film makers reveal the wife's naughtiness in just the right way .  all of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office .  there's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist's arrival .  meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown !  unlike so many movies of this genre ,  the script is very very tight .  all the victims fall into the dentist's trap in very calculated ways .  two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the end .   definitely not for the faint of heart or the dental-phobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests . 
this is an entertaining movie .  actually might make you uncomfortable since it isn't some undead psychopath or sociopath ,  its your everyday doctor .  how scary is that .  got some good actors and actresses in this movie ,  though some where unappreciated like virginya keehne as sarah .  ken foree who you might recognize from rob zombie's devils rejects and halloween ( 2007 )  co-stars as our detective on schizoid dr .  alan feinstone's ( corbin benson ) trail .  short little summary is this :  dr .  alan feinstone ,  a guy who has a sexy wife ,  nice house ,  and is a great dentist everyone loves .  until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner .  then he starts having hallucinations that his patients' teeth are all rotted and that the female patients are his wife as he starts going nuts in this thriller .  but before that ,  nice guy . 
return of the jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series ,  and is a fine conclusion to the star wars saga .  with han solo imprisoned by jabba the hut and the empire building a new death star ,  the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side ,  and only our favourite heroes can pull it off .   the opening sequence ,  set on tatooine ,  we see jabba's palace ,  a pit of slavery and scum ,  and new home to han solo ,  as luke and the gang prepare for his rescue ,  and with luke's jedi powers ,  they have the edge .   we also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end .  han ,  leia and chewy battle it out on endor ,  desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the death star .  the rebel fleet led by lando ,  battle with the imperial fleet while they wait for the shields to go down ,  and luke has a final showdown with darth vader .  an epic end to a classic saga ,  and it's only just of the pace of the first two .   10/10
doctor feinstone is a dentist . he has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a pool . suddenly he discovers that his wife is making out with the pool attendant-he realises that behind everything clean , there is decay . he starts to torture his patients .  .  . corbin bernsen is brilliant as the deranged dentist-he is completely believable . there is surprisingly little gore but the scenes of dental torture are quite nasty and grotesque . highly recommended .  " the dentist 2 "  is also worth checking out ! 
director brian yuzna has had an uneven career in the horror genre ,  creating masterpieces such as  " return of the living dead 3 "  or  " bride of re-animator "  ,  but at the same time he has done awful movies such as  " faust :  love for the damned "  or the mediocre  " progeny "  .  he is obviously better in the seat of producer where his work producing stuart gordon's films has been superb .    " the dentist "  ,  is one of his lesser works as director ,  but the low profile it has benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes it a very enjoyable experience .  it tells the story of dr .  alan feinstone  ( played superbly by corbin bernsen )  ,  a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not really as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife  ( linda hoffman ) has an affair with the pool boy .  this event disturbs his mind and puts him in a killing spree as he takes revenge on the world for being so  " filthy "  .   the premise is very well handled by yuzna ,  as he takes us on a ride following feinstone's day of revenge .  what makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim's perspective ,  we follow feinstone because he is the main character .  we witness how he goes from respected professional to psycho murder in a day .  yuzna manages to give the movie the exact amount of suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie .   most of the success of the premise is in bernsen's performance as feinstone .  he can make you feel sympathy and hate towards him at the same time ,  and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that aids the film .  the rest of the cast is not as good ,  and i think that their sub par acting hurts the film more than it should .  a notable exception is ken foree ,  as the detective trying to catch feinstone .  while his part is quite small ,  he makes a great job with it .   with a dentist as killer ,  gory scenes are expected ,  and brian yuzna delivers great sfx in the correct amount .  it's good to see that he does not go over-the-top with it as he usually do ,  and i dare to say that this is a highlight of the film .  it has the exact amount of gore that is expected ,  nothing less and nothing more .  yuzna restrained himself of his common excesses and the result is great .   while this is not among yuzna's most well-known films ,  i would say that it is one of his best .  sure ,  it is not classic material as his masterpieces ,  but it is a movie that entertains and never gets tiresome or boring .  it is a low-budget simple film ,  but for what it is ,  i think it rocked .  7/10
i remember this movie in particular when i was a teenager ,  my best friend was telling me all about this movie and how it freaked her out as a kid .  of course being the blood thirsty gal that i am ,  i had to go out and find this movie .  now i don't know how to put this without loosing credibility ,  so i'm just going to say it ,  i actually had fun watching this movie !  i know that it's stupid ,  not the best story and beyond bloody and gruesome ,  but that's what i was looking for and the dentist delivers in the scares ,  blood ,  sex ,  and crazy psychopaths .  sometimes i just need a fun movie like this to just let loose and get grossed out by .   dr .  alan feinstone is obsessed with order and cleanliness .  on the day of his wedding anniversary ,  he spies his wife brooke having sex with their filthy pool man ,  matt .  at his dental practice ,  feinstone's first patient of the day is young jody saunders ,  there for his very first dental appointment .  feinstone begins to clean jody's teeth .  everything goes smoothly at first ,  until he imagines that jody's teeth are brown and rotten .  his dental pick slips ,  stabbing jody in the gums .  jody's mother picks up her crying ,  bleeding child and leaves angrily .  feinstone sees his second patient ,  beauty queen april reign .  alone with april ,  feinstone sedates her with nitrous oxide so that he can fill a cavity in one of her molars .  as she drifts off into unconsciousness ,  feinstone imagines that she has transformed into his wife .  he begins kissing and fondling her on the dental chair ,  then begins to choke her .  april starts to cough and half-wakes up from the gas .  feinstone snaps out of his trance and quickly re-buttons april's blouse .  feinstone decides to end the day early and sends his staff and patients home .  later that night ,  brooke meets feinstone at his practice .  he reveals his new italian opera-themed patient room .  he encourages brooke to try out the room's dental chair .  when she does ,  feinstone binds her to the chair and sedates her with nitrous oxide .  with operatic music blaring in the background ,  he begins to pull out brooke's teeth .  feinstone has gone off the deep end and is definitely not going to let anybody stand in his way of cleanliness .   honestly ,  as silly as this movie sounds ,  i did have a lot of fun watching the dentist .  the best scene without a doubt is when he teaches that nasty irs agent a lesson in hygiene that i'm sure he'll never forget .  man ,  i don't think i've brushed my teeth so much after i watched the dentist .  yeah ,  i am going to warn you ,  this movie is in no way for the faint of heart ,  it's very bloody .  there's stabbing ,  gun shots and just these brutal dental torture scenes that will make your stomach turn .  yet somehow i just enjoyed this movie ,  if i ever want just a good gore movie that was made for true horror fans ,  i slip it in my dvd player ,  and that's the  " tooth "  lol !  i am so funny !  um ,  yeah ,  i try ,  give me a little credit .   7/10
after witnessing his wife  ( linda hoffman )  engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy ,  the already somewhat unstable dentist dr .  feinstone  ( corbin bernsen )  completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patients .   this delightful semi-original and entertaining horror flick from director brian yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late nineties .  although the dentist' is intended to be a cheesy ,  fun little film ,  yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense .  despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters ,  and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days ,  the movie is intriguing ,  generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest ,  even during the more ludicrous of moments .  the dentist' suffers ,  on occasion ,  from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel ,  there are only sporadic uninteresting moments ,  and in general the movie follows itself nicely .   corbin bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic ,  deranged and perfectionist dr .  alan feinstone .  the way bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines ,  especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex  ( particularly fellatio )  ,  is something short of marvellous .  while many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous ,  bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable .  had the dentist' not been intended to be a fun ,  almost comical ,  horror movie ,  bernsen's performance would probably have been much more powerful .  sadly ,  the rest of the cast  ( including a pre-fame mark ruffalo )  failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this ,  stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick .   the dentist' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable ,  particularly  ( i would presume )  for fans of cheesy horror .  those who became annoyed at the number of scream'  ( 1996 )  clones from the late nineties may very well find this a refreshing change ,  as i did .  a seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make the dentist' one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the 1990's .  on top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and  ( on the whole )  realistic scenes of dental torture ,  which should keep most gorehounds happy .  far from perfect but far from bad as well ,  the dentist' is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once .  my rating for the dentist'  6 . 5/10 . 
this gem for gore lovers is extremely underrated .  it's pure delight and fun !  gratuitous servings of blood ,  insanity and black humor ,  which can please even the most demanding lover of the genre .  a full exploitation of the almost universal fear of dentists and flawlessly shot .  only for the connoisseurs . 
i love the satan pit !  !  !  david tennant is such a great actor and so is billie piper !  !  !  who else loves will thorp to pieces ?  ?  ?  he is so cute ,  isn't he ?  i hated the bits where he got possessed by the devil and where he got told to  " go to hell "  ,  as rose so bluntly put it .  mind you ,  he was quite funny when he said ,   " rose ,  do us a favour ,  will you ?  shut up !  "  .  mr jefferson was so brave ,  wasn't he ?  dying to save the others .  i felt really sorry for toby  ( will thorp )  when he came out of the possession for the 2nd time because he was so scared .  i was like  " oh my god if i was rose i'd be so scared for him "  .  and when she hugged him i was like  " grrrrrr ,  he's mine !  hands off !  "  but i thought that was really sweet .  and the doctor .  .  .  . well ,  i thought he was gonna say to ida  " tell rose i love her "  but he didn't .  oh well . 
anyone find it interesting that the ood look strangely similar to the 'great cthulhu' of h p lovecraft vintage ?  hmmm ?    great pair of episodes  ( not referring to billie piper as most seem to do !  )  in the impossible planet and the satan pit .   also the link to 'legion' i think also used in who before and also referring to satan in various novels post exorcist era .  .  .   great suspense episodes utilising fear and faith elements .  the new team for these 'who's are working great magic for tv .   this certainly creates new fears and 'hide behind the sofa' feelings not seen for many ,  many years in this continuation of a superb bbc series  ( pity it is confirmed by the bbc that billie piper is quitting - perhaps not permanently - after end of series 2 )   : o (  (  ( 
i thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parter ,  the impossible planet ,  and was slightly worried that the second part wouldn't hold up quite so well as has been true in the past of the two parters of the past 2 who series .  but thankfully my fears were unfounded as i found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one .  anyway we start off with the surviving crew members on the run from the ood ,  whom have become the devil's pawn .  there is also a bit of philosophizing on the doctor's part in the episode that i quite enjoyed .  needless to say it was a good solid doctor who story .  might be a tad too intense for the younger viewers though .   my grade :  b+
this was an excellent 2-part episode ,  although i had never been seen the older ones ,  i never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal ,  extra terrestial of course but not paranormal .   this episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans ,  in a futuristic time ,  would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossible .   being that it's a family film i am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith ,  especially if its also going to entertain american audiences .  but who care about what yanks say ,  we rock !  doctor who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005 ,  first being so harmless to scary ,  from fun to serious ,  from light to darkness .  i hope many old fans will one day soon say  " the old doctor who has returned "  .   10 out of 10
this is ,  without a shadow of a doubt ,  one of the scariest and most intriguing episodes of doctor who .  this is a thrilling psychological ride and you will probably find your own beliefs being thrown into question .  riddled with spine-chilling moments ,  this is an episode no  " who "  fan can afford to miss .   starting from when the pit was opened after the events in  " the impossible planet "  ,  the doctor and ida are trapped and are running out of air .  with no other alternatives ,  they decide to find what lies at the bottom of the pit ,  an event which surpasses even the doctor's expectations .  whilst there ,  the doctor is forced to make what he considers to be the ultimate sacrifice .  .  .   meanwhile ,  rose and the other members of the planet try to find a way to fend off the ood ,  whose minds have been poisoned by the beast .  also ,  is toby zed truly cured of his possession by the beast ? 
despite the feelings of most  " star wars "  fans ,  in my opinion  " return of the jedi "  is the greatest cinematic film ever created .  ever since the first time i saw it ,  it's depth ,  intensity ,  special effects ,  and moving story have overwhelmed me .  the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years .  filled with powerful action ,  as the climax of the original trilogy ,  george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the  " star wars "  saga in  " jedi "  .   film summary  ( contains spoilers for those who have not seen it )   after  " the empire strikes back "  left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in  " return of the jedi "  .  darth vader ,  in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee it's construction .  the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side .  luke ,  lando ,  leia ,  chewie ,  and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord ;  jabba the hutt .  after han has been rescued ,  and jabba defeated ,  luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth ;  darth vader is in fact his father .  the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet .  now joined by other species and races including the mon calamari the rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed .  while lando heads the space attack in the millennium falcon ,  the rebel heroes must disable the death star's shield generator on the forest moon of endor .  it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry ,  but mighty ewoks .  during the the two part intense battle ,  a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side .  in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor lures out his dark emotions .  as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine ,  vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life .    filled with a deep timeless story of good vs .  evil ,   " return of the jedi "  is a spectacular ,  emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us . 
the impossible planet and the satan pit together comprise the two best episodes of the 'new' doctor who's second season .  having said that ,  it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of quatermass and the pit  ( 1967 )  to an outer space setting ,  with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the beast 666 .  these episodes cement the emotional ties between rose and the doctor ,  whilst also highlighting rose's increasing self-confidence ,  establishing her as a not-quite-equal-yet-but-getting-there partner with our beloved time lord .  also of note is matt jones elegant screenplay ,  which decreases the occasional over-reliance on one-liners for the doctor ,  and the performances of the entire cast ,  most notably the excellent shaun parkes as acting captain zachary cross flane . 
this two-parter was excellent - the best since the series returned .  sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films ,  but what tv shows don't do that these days .  what we got here was a cracking good sci-fi story .  a great big  ( really scary )  monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit ,  some superb aliens in the ood - the best  " new "  aliens the revived series has come up with ,  a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters  ( complete with a couple of unnamed  " expendable "  security people in true star trek fashion )  ,  some large-scale philosophical themes  ( love ,  loyalty ,  faith ,  etc .  )  ,  and some top-drawer special effects .   i loved every minute of this . 
main theme in this dirty harry is that revenge is a dish best served cold .  sandra locke is as cold in this film as she is beautiful .  locke is an  " 8 "  normally ,  but ,  with a deadly pistol in her purse ,   " cocked "  for the bad guys ,  she climbs all the way up the scale to a  " 10 "  .  having been gang-raped ,  along with her younger sister ,  some years ago ,  locke ,  as jennifer spencer ,  has tried to block out the attack from her life ,  as best she can .  her sister ,  tho ,  is almost comatose as a result of the trauma ,  so the memory is never far from her mind .  one day ,  jennifer sees one of her attackers on the street in s . f .  ;  she buys a pistol ,  follows him to a bar ,  lets him pick her up ,  then when they're alone in his cadillac ,  beginning to make love ,  she shoots him .  .  .  . once in the genitals ,  once in the brain - - this in the opening scene !  !  ya gotta love this spunky lady .  she's got her priorities straight .  plus ,  jennifer is a professional artist ,  putting all her anger on canvas until now .  after executing her first perp ,  jennifer curiously watches det .  insp .  harry callahan process the fresh crime scene after the body is found in the caddy .  then ,  she insults some creepy teenage bucks who are hassling women on the street ,  visits her sister in a nursing home ,  then goes a'hunting in san paolo ,  ca  " up the coast "  where the rape event took place years ago .  with more bullets in her suitcase and more resolve in her mind ,  our heroine relives the rape inside her head with vivid recall ,  as she comes closer to executing each subsequent rapist .  not uncommon to us right- wingers ,  when it comes to sentencing or executing a violent criminal ,  don't be sorrowful for his own wretched humanity ,  we remember the crime and the suffering he inflicted .  such recalled events steels jennifer to pull the trigger on each of her attackers - once in the genitals ,  once in the brain .  throughout the movie ,  scenes of jennifer's revenge are interspersed with good ,  il' dirty harry blowing away some gangstas in a coffee shop ,  remember  " go ahead .  make my day .  "  ?  later on ,  he threatens to step on a punk kid  ( who'd just insulted callahan )  in a courthouse elevator like he'd step on dog- s**t .  .  .  . leaving a young female govt employee staring after clint as if to say  " i want to have your baby .  "  my favorite scene is only about 30 minutes into the action ,  when harry threatens and frightens a murderous mafia boss named threlkis into a fatal coronary during his granddaughter's wedding reception at the mark hopkins hotel .  michael grazzo  ( pantangeli in godfather ii )  does a wonderful job as the sinful mafia don ,  even if he's only in one scene ,  dying in a most-convincing manner .  however ,  harry's troubles aren't over with yet !  the elevator punk's gang and threlkis' henchmen each attempt to assassinate harry in two close-ordered scenes ,  and most of them bad guys end up dying horribly .  yup ,  some of the gun-play comes off as uninspired screen violence .  .  .  . looking like clint the director may have been tired that day of shooting this movie .  but ,  there's only so many ways you can dispatch a man with bullets .  the punk kids die much more creatively ,  though ,  as they both burn to death and drown in s . f .  bay .  warms my heart .  with so much violent intent directed at insp .  callahan ,  his bosses send him to san paolo to try to get some background on the  " 22 caliber vasectomy killing "  as jennifer spencer's crime is now known ,  but not before harry delivers one of his famous sermons-to-the- chowder-headed-liberals .  love that harry .  while our hero' up annoying the local cops and citizens in san paolo ,  two more murders happen ,  same m . o .  ,  on a sleazy ,  lazy fisherman and on an equally-creepy hardware entrepreneur .  then harry meets jennifer !  they find they both agree on subjects such as law and order ,  making the guilty pay ,  etc .  could a hot ,  love scene be in the offing soon ?  we're led to believe just that .  characters abound in this real-man meets real-woman crime drama ,  and we get to meet a brassy bull-dyke named raye parkins who's both irritating and entertaining .  raye set up jennifer's rape for her  " boyfriend "  years before ,  and she'll get hers eventually .  the san paolo police chief ,  played by reliable eastwood co-star pat hingle  ( the hanging judge in 'hang em high' )  ,  is strangely at odds with callahan's detective work related to the 22-cal vasectomies ,  until we find out that his own adolescent son was one of the gang of rapists .  much like jennifer's sister ,  chief janning's son is now a comatose adult ,  but driven mad by guilt .  it can't end here ,  though .  the dyke's rapist boyfriend ,  mick ,  now a kinky-sex jerk of a criminal ,  drives in from vegas becuz raye's dropped a dime on jennifer ,  summoning him up to san paolo to prevent more executions .  mick sleeps at raye's house ,  but his timing is all wrong ,  and he's arrested before he can spend more time with raye ,  mostly due to the fact that she's since been sent to the island of the eternal lesboes by a shot from jennifer's revolver .  psycho mick makes bail at long last ,  with jennifer gunning for him .  a desperate chase ensues ,  as harry tries to keep these two from killing each other .  it all turns out well in the end ,  with the good gal and the good guy walking off into the sunset together to a beautiful roberta flack blues song . 
despite the other comments listed here ,  this is probably the best dirty harry movie made ;  a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the country's socio-political feelings during the reagan glory years of the early '80's .  it's also a kickass action movie .   opening with a liberal ,  female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums  ( the scene which prompts the famous ,   " go ahead ,  make my day "  line )  ,   " sudden impact "  is one non-stop roller coaster of an action film .  the first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome inspector callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood .  it gets only better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past .  superb direction and photography and a at-times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the '80's . 
sudden impact is the best of the five dirty harry movies .  they don't come any leaner and meaner than this as harry romps through a series of violent clashes ,  with the bad guys getting their just desserts .  which is just the way i like it .  great story too and ably directed by clint himself .  excellent entertainment . 
i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie .  its got a pretty good plot ,  some good action ,  and the change of location for harry does not hurt either .  sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that .  eastwood is in good form as dirty harry ,  and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop .  if you liked dirty harry ,  then you should see this one ,  its a lot better than the dead pool .  4/5
****excellent  ***good  **fair  *poor  `go ahead ,  make my day ! '   the fourth picture in the series is directed by eastwood himself  ( who was rumored of directing most of magnum force )  and he brings back the violent society from the first two films .  however ,  the film still lacks impact and believability .  this film was released in the early `80s ,  the time of regan and the young republicans .  the premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesn't appeal to this time frame .  this plot would have been better for the enforcer ,  which actually would have made it a good movie .  what sudden impact needed was a plot like in wall street but with dirty harry in the middle .    rating :  3 stars
dirty harry has to track down a rape victim who extracts revenge by shooting her assailants in the goolies before killing them .  probably a more apt punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever like she and her sister has .  .  . anyway .  .  .  .  .  an action-packed story set again in san francisco and santa cruz .  the chief rapist ,  played by andy drake is suitably vile and gets his punishment at the end  ( of course !  )  .  not a classic movie but better than the others except for the original dirty harry . 
after what was considered to be the official dirty harry trilogy with the enforcer ( 1976 )  to be the final chapter in the series .  dirty harry is back ,  older ,  more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original 1971 classic .   dirty harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer ,  vigilante cops ,  and vietnam veteran terrorists .  but now he's after a new killer ,  a killer who wants payback ,  by gunning down her attackers .   sudden impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to dirty harry .  callahan is on a new murder case that is circling back to a woman ( played by sondra locke )  ,  who was brutally raped ,  along with her sister ,  who is left traumitized .  ten years after ,  she's out for revenge by gunning down her attackers .  at the same though callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack ,  of which the mob are hunting him as well .  so in order to let the heat die down within the city ,  harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town ,  but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well ,  while hunting her attackers one by one .  harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar ,  as he homes in on the killer's trails .   sudden impact in my opinion ,  has to be one of my top 10 revenge films ,  as well as being the second best dirty harry movie yet ,  far better than both the enforcer and the dead pool combined .  sudden impact has what the original dirty harry had ,  a dark tone with entertaining value .   so do you feel lucky ,  punk ? 
clint eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this ,  but this one does not embarrass him .  dirty harry catches everyone's attention and unless one wants to watch romance ,  there is no reason why you won't like him .  he is cool because he is dirty ,  is great because he kills without much thinking ,  is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care .   from what i have seen in movies in which eastwood acts ,  the character of the lead role always captivates the audience .  in white hunter black heart ,  he is the crazy director ,  in  " in the line of fire "  he is the  " old 'un "  while here is the  " almost "  jobless with his job ,  that is to say he makes work for himself ,  doesn't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation .   based on a rape victim ,  this movie is promising for all the  " no non-sense "  movie watchers .  the movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot .  however ,  what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not ,  as it is far too obvious from the beginning .  it is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving .  also ,  there are too many people far dirtier than dirty harry . 
this final entry in george lucas's star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot .  however ,  this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series .  on the contrary .  sure ,  it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times ,  but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission .   the first third of the movie ,  where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt ,  is a classic .  jabba ,  a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language ,  not only makes a great villain ,  but a memorable one ,  too .  it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet ,  much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product .  actually ,  what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba's court ,  including the intimidating ,  slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster .  it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while .   things get a little bit slower around the second act ,  where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor ,  home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks .  most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures ,  in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga .  i don't totally agree with that ,  although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should .  however ,  their leader ,  wicket  ( played by warrick davis )  is a delightfully memorable creation ,  and watching how they handle the imperial troops' technology with their simple ,  natural weapons provides a nice contrast .   by the time we get to the third act ,  though ,  the pace picks up again ,  as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops ,  lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire's all-new half-completed death star ,  and luke's final showdown with darth vader and the emperor .  the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie .  mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes ,  and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance .  also ,  as iconic as james earl jones' voice as darth vader is ,  he is rivaled only by the shriveled ,  crone-like emperor ,  played with deliciously raspy ,  frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid .  the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment ,  which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored .   the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects ,  and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors .  the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always ,  and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout .  of course ,  given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back ,  it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence .  the acting is classic star wars fare ;  hamill ,  harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles ,  and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c-3po .  frank oz's yoda only appears in two scenes ,  but he makes the most of it .  and yes ,  there's also john williams' music .   all told ,  while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle ,  the first and third acts deliver in style ,  making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever .   in 1997 ,  george lucas re-released the classic star wars in digitally restored  ( and revamped )   " special editions "  ,  which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements .  of the three ,  return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans .  perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place  ( albeit funny if you're not so easily offended )   " jedi rocks "  musical number in jabba's palace ,  which ,  although technically amazing ,  does disrupt the flow of the film .  however ,  i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy .  this dvd version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes  ( notably on naboo ,  where we hear what sounds like jar jar binks screaming ,   " wesa free !  "  )  ,  and ,  in what is probably the most controversial change ,  hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes .  probably due to the intense  ( and unfair )  disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii :  attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone .  however ,  if you're watching the star wars saga chronologically  ( and contemplating about it )  ,  chances are you may react a little differently .  nonetheless ,  it is an issue that fans have raised ,  so it's probably best to be warned beforehand .   as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films ,  he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the  " definitive "  editions of his classic trilogy ,  and ,  when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga  ( as lucas intended )  ,  it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent .  the original films will always be engraved in our memories ,  but these new incarnations are just as much fun ,  if one can give them a chance . 
sudden impact tends to be treated as eastwood's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director .  the reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support .  in some places it actually owes more to death wish than the original dirty harry film .  one might argue if that is so- at the end of the day it's a film about guilt ,  justice and retribution .  for me ,  at the end of the day it's more empathy than sympathy .  however ,  in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film .  forget the  " go ahead punk ,  make my day scene "  ,  that's iconic but not original .  but look at the views of san fransisco taken from the air ,  zooming in on the city .  the first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular .  or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where sondra locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital .  eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces .  so all in all sudden impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature eastwood is as a director .  and if i remember correctly it was actually the first time eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology .  also ,  i think this is the first well paced film eastwood directed .  although eastwood has enormous talent as a director ,  dramaturgy has always been his weak point  ( see play misty for me ,  breezy etc .  )  thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story .  the only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog . 
this was without a doubt the best of the  " dirty harry "  series .  from the opening credits ,  you're swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly engrossing .  sondra locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge .  eastwood has many  " aside "  sequences that have nothing to do with the plot ,  but show harry at his bad-assed best .  loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles ,  this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective/action flicks .  this is the one dirty harry flick that's raw and devoid of any  " fluff "  .  i can watch this again and again  ( okay ,  not in one sitting )  because it's a gratifying  " out for revenge "  yarn .  the pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable .   " go ahead - make my day .  .  . you feel lucky ,  punk ?   .  .  .  .  "  classic eastwood as only eastwood ,  with his anguished ,  rubbery expressions ,  and whispery ,  menacing voice can do it . 
when this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative tagline  " dirty harry is at it again "  .  whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than compensated for by it's complete and total accuracy .   " sudden impact "  retains all the aspects that made the previous three dirty harry movies so successful- tight pacing ,  a compelling plot ,  strong supporting characters ,  endless gunplay ,  and bone-dry humor .  some of these elements are not only retained but amplified- this is easily the darkest ,  bloodiest ,  and most overtly right-wing installment of the franchise .   the plot is somewhat intriguing :  after killing a ridiculous number of hoodlums ,  inspector callahan is sent on a forced  " vacation "  by his superiors to the sleepy coastal town of san paolo .  he is tasked to investigate the background of a recent homicide victim who was shot in the genitals before being put out of his  ( no doubt considerable )  misery by a second shot to the head .  early on in the film ,  the audience is made aware of the identity of the killer- an artist named jennifer spencer  ( sondra locke )  who is hunting down the thugs who gang-raped her and her sister at a fun fair some ten years earlier .  this incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback ,  snippets of which recur before each new murder .  as more bodies start to appear with the same m . o ,  it becomes clear to harry that both the local police chief and his new love interest  ( guess who ?  )  know more than they are telling .  to make matters even more complicated ,  the one-time rapists realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard .    " sudden impact "  offers relentless action from beginning to end .  clint eastwood directed this film himself and expertly handles a series of set pieces that culminate in an exhilarating climax .  sondra locke's performance effectively conveys the blend of ruthlessness and fragility that define her character .  that having been said ,  it is fair to wonder if another actress  ( who was not eastwood's off-screen companion at the time )  could have brought more charisma and dramatic weight to the role- theresa russell and cybill shepherd jump to mind as possible candidates .  members of the supporting cast that punch significantly above their weight include albert popwell as harry's partner horace ,  paul drake as the psychopathic mick ,  and the truly scene-stealing audrie j .  neenan who portrays the vicious ray parkins .    however the film has some notable problems- some of the subplots  ( the animosity between harry and a gang of twentysomething hoodlums ,  a mob vendetta against him )  take up too much screen time and don't really have any bearing to the larger story .  their only real use is to raise the body-count to absurd levels .  in the first half of the film it sometimes appears that dirty harry shoots people more often than he has to use the restroom .  however the film moves into top gear as it progresses and the triangulated cat-and-mouse game between callahan ,  spencer ,  and her former tormentors assumes prominence .  this second hour makes it clear that a more stripped-down and slightly refocused screenplay would have given  " sudden impact "  the potential to be a first-class ,  neo noir-style thriller that could have taken the series to new levels but still have contained more than enough  . 44 magnum heroics to satisfy the harry loyalists .  instead we get the film that eastwood and warner bros .  clearly wanted to make- a superbly executed but prototypical eighties action flick that mostly declines to particularly challenge the intelligence of it's intended audience .    this was by far the biggest grossing of the series at the box-office and it is not hard to see why .  though not the film that it could have been ,  this is still big ,  trigger-happy fun .  even after repeated viewings ,  it's going to make your day . 
sudden impact was overall better than the enforcer in my opinion .  it was building up to be a great movie ,  but then i saw the villain ( s )  and was disappointed .   sudden impact was different than the previous installments .  the plot went a different direction in this movie ,  as dirty harry doesn't take as much of a police approach this time around .  we also don't see the villain ( s )  until later ,  which means less screen time for them ,  which is better for us all .   clint eastwood once again steals the show as dirty harry ,  enough said .  pat hingle was enjoyable as chief jannings ,  harry's new assigned boss .  bradford dillman seemed to change his name to captain briggs here ,  either way ,  he wasn't any different .  michael currie is decent as lt .  donnelly ,  harry's annoying superior .  i personally enjoyed kevyn major howard as hawkins ,  the young punk who has a vendetta against harry .  albert popwell was excellent as horace ,  harry's buddy .  audrie j .  neenan was good as ray parkins ,  a famous lesbian around town .  jack thibeau was well cast as kruger ,  a pervert .  now for the really bad part .  sandra locke ,  eastwood's long-time lover was horribly miscast as jennifer spencer ,  harry's love interest .  and paul drake was just horrible as mick .   the movie would have been so much better if not for better writing and acting on some parts .   8/10 . 
in don siegel's 1971 masterpiece  " dirty harry "  ,  clint eastwood epitomized the super-tough ,  super-cool unorthodox ,  no-nonsense cinema-cop with his role of the eponymous inspector 'dirty' harry callahan .  two sequels followed ,  the first of which ,   " magnum force "  ,  tamed down on the delightfully politically incorrect attitude of the first one that had outraged many critics but enthused audiences .  the second sequel ,   " the enforcer "  was grittier again ,  and was promoted as  " the dirtiest harry of them all "  .  this title ,  however ,  truly belongs to the fourth film in the series ,  clint eastwood's own  " sudden impact "  ,  which is doubtlessly the grittiest ,  nastiest ,  most violent and downright dirtiest of all harry films ,  and ,  in my humble opinion ,  the second-best after the masterpiece original .   ***warning !  spoilers ahead ! *** in a small town near san francisco ,  a mysterious sexy lady  ( sondra locke )  lures men into being alone with her .  what these men don't know is that mysterious beauty is their former rape victim ,  longing for bloody revenge .  as fate wants it ,  san francisco's toughest cop ,  inspector dirty harry callahan ,  who has been suspended once again for angering his superiors ,  spends his leisure time in this exact little town .  .  .   " sudden impact "  is the dirtiest callahan film in several aspects .  the film is extremely gritty and graphically violent .  harry callahan himself is dirtier than ever .  not afraid to make use of his 44 .  magnum in order to stop trouble ,  harry treats 'punks' as they are to be treated and even allows a person to get away with several murders because the revenge-murders are justified in his opinion .  clint eastwood is ,  as always ,  brilliant in the role of harry callahan .  eastwood epitomized coolness and bad-assery as the  " man with no name "  in sergio leone's dollar trilogy ,  and he did so again in the dirty harry films .   " sudden impact "  gives us the dirtiest harry we have ever seen .  eastwood's real-life girlfriend sondra locke fits very well in the role of the vengeful beauty .  the great pat hingle ,  who had already worked with eastwood in ted post's tough-minded western  " hang 'em high "  in 1986 plays the police chief of the small town .  the film furthermore includes a wide range of truly despicable scumbag characters ,  including a pathetic criminal played by kevin major howard  ( best known for his role in stanley kubrick's  " full metal jacket "  )  and a woman named ray perkins  ( audrie j .  neenan )  ,  doubtlessly one of the most disgusting and despicable female characters ever in cinema .  albert popwell ,  who played the bank robber in the famous  " do you feel lucky ?  "  scene in  " dirty harry "  and the black militant leader in  " the enforcer "  is also part of this one again ,  this time as harry's colleague and buddy .  overall  " sudden impact "  is the grittiest ,  dirtiest and probably the most violent of all  " dirty harry "  films ,   ( though  " the dead pool "  isn't exactly tame either )  ,  and my second-favorite after the brilliant 1971 original .  an absolute must-see for callahan fans ,  and highly recommended to all lovers of police thrillers and cinematic bad-assery .  my rating :  8 . 5/10
clint eastwood returns as dirty harry calahan in the 4th movie of the dirty harry series .  clint is older but he's still got it ,  harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery  ( where the memorable  " make my day "  catchphrase comes from !  )  but the city he took a vacation was worse ,  a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a funfair and starts getting the punks one by one .  the last movie to see sandra locke in a clint eastwood movie !  an improvement after the enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious .  clint eastwood's sunglasses were gargoyles which are best known for the sunglasses that are worn by arnold shwartzeneger in the terminator .  worth a watch if you like clint eastwood ,  the dirty harry films or like action crime thrillers . 
sudden impact is a two pronged story .  harry is targeted by the mob who want to kill him and harry is very glad to return the favour and show them how it's done .  this little war puts harry on suspension which he doesn't care about but he goes away on a little vacation .  now the second part of the story .  someone is killing some punks and harry gets dragged into this situation where he meets jennifer spencer a woman with a secret that the little tourist town wants to keep quiet .  the police chief is not a subtle man and he warns harry to not get involved or cause any trouble .  this is harry callahan trouble follows him .  the mob tracks him to this town and hell opens up as harry goes to war .  meanwhile the vigilante strikes again and the gang having figured it out is ready for her .  jennifer spencer is caught and harry comes to her rescue during the film's climax .  sudden impact is not the greatest dirty harry but at the time it gives us a harry that is very much an anti hero ready to go to war just to pursue justice .  again not the best not the worst but the one with the most remembered line .  go ahead make your day . 
i liked nearly all the movies in the dirty harry series with the exception of the one i think is titled  " enforcer "  .   " deadpool "  was a bit weak in areas too ,  but i still enjoyed it .  this one is one of my favorites of the series ,  if nothing else for the great line of  " go ahead ,  make my day "  .  this one also features an interesting albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong .  just think  " magnum force "  with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot .  granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice final showdown at an amusement park .  it also features dirty harry getting a bulldog as a gift and it tripping up sandra locke in a rather humorous scene .  the only question that remains is why clint eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress sandra locke in so many of his movies .  she brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me .  granted she is not to bad here ,  but her character could have been so much better by someone else .  another problem with this movie and other dirty harry movies ,  at times they almost seem to be advertisements for guns .  i like guns as much as the next person ,  but do we really need scenes of him explaining all the different strengths of his newest weapon and how many bullets it holds ?  still ,  very nice entry into the dirty harry series of movies . 
clint eastwood would star again as the battle-weary detective harry callahan ,  but would also direct the fourth entry in the 'dirty harry' series .  'sudden impact' again like the other additions ,  brings its own distinguishable style and tone ,  but if anything it's probably the most similar to the original in it's darker and seedy moments  ( and bestowing a classic line  " go ahead .  make my day "  )  but some of its humor has to been seen to believe .  a bulldog named meathead that pisses and farts .  oh yeah .  however an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in san francisco .   the story follows that of detective callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes .  after getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood .  he's ordered to take leave ,  but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town san paulo ,  where a murder has occurred similar in vein  ( bullet to groin and between eyes )  to his case .  there he begins to dig up dirt ,  which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge .   to be honest ,  i wasn't all that crash hot on eastwood's take ,  but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel 'magnum force' .  this well-assembled plot actually gives eastwood another angle to work upon  ( even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time )  ,  quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging .  it's like he's experimenting with noir-thriller touches with character-driven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework .  his use of images is lasting ,  due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics .  dark tones ,  brooding lighting like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure  ( harry with his new  . 44 automag handgun )  moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks .  it's a striking sight that builds fear !  mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor .  it seemed to come off .  a major plus with these films are the dialogues ,  while i wouldn't call 'sudden impact' first-rate ,  it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable lines  " you're a legend in your own mind "  .  don't you just love hearing harry sparking an amusing quip ,  before pulling out his piece .  the beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intense the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages .  lalo schfrin would return as composer  ( after 'the enforcer "  had jerry fielding scoring )  bringing a methodical funky kick ,  which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the get-go .  bruce surtees  ( an eastwood regular )  gets the job behind the camera  ( where he did a piecing job with 'dirty harry' )  and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes ,  but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic moments .   eastwood as the dinosaur callahan still packs a punch ,  going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger callahan .  this going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of harry's quest for justice by the badge even though he doesn't always agree with it .  i just found it odd a real change of heart .  across from him is a stupendous performance by his beau at the time sondra locke .  her turn of traumatic torment  ( being senselessly raped along with her younger sister )  ,  is hidden by a glassily quiet intensity .  when the anger is released ,  it's tactically accurate in its outcome .  paul drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and audrie j .  neenan nails down a repellently scummy and big-mouthed performance .  these people are truly an ugly bunch of saps .  pat hingle is sturdy as the chief of the small coastal town .  in smaller parts are bradford dillman and the agreeably potent albert popwell  ( a regular in the series 1-4 ,  but under different characters )  .  how can you forget him in 'dirty harry' yes he is bank robber that's at the end of the trademark quote  " do i feel lucky ?  well ,  do ya ,  punk ?  " 
clint eastwood reprises his role as dirty harry who this time is on the case of a vigilante  ( sondra locke ) who is killing the people that raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago .  eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk ,  not that i'm complaining .  sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment . 
after  " star wars :  a new hope "  redefined science fiction ,  and  " the empire strikes back "  redefined  " star wars "  ,  it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two ,  but this one really does a nice job .  the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one ,  with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films .  then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war .  there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the emperor .  when the battle begins ,  the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it ,  and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films .  this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy ,  with the most at stake for the rebellion .  this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land  ( including han solo ,  chewbacca ,  and leia )  ,  the battle raging on in space  ( including lando )  ,  and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star ,  which leads up to another duel with darth vader .  it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war ,  and there seems to be no escape .  although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched ,  it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use ,  rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers ,  although they did have some luck fighting them .  there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming ,  which may not be quite as stunning as that of  " the empire strikes back "  ,  but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well .  with the light tone of  " a new hope "  and the more sinnister tone of  " the empire strikes back "  ,  this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale .  the special edition for  " return of the jedi "  concentrated on what would have been nice to change ,  since not much of the original really needed it .  fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned ,  and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter ,  but other than that it was good .  the gaping non-threatening sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged ,  which definitely added to the suspense .  also ,  the disco was taken out of jabba's palace ,  and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy ,  instead of just a small ewok village ,  which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved .  it's hard to say which of the three films was the best ,  but since it's all part of the same story ,  the over-all trilogy is like one big ,  outstanding film .  a third must-see for film fans . 
having never seen the original dirty harry ,  i judged this movie on a clean slate .  and i must say ,  i quite enjoyed it .  sure ,  some of the acting by sondre locke made me a little squeemish - but hey ,  it was the 80's .  but even if you can't get past her  ( and i almost couldn't )  or her revenge killings  ( which seemed a little .  .  overdone  ; p )  ,  it's worth it just for dirty harry .  or at the very least ,  the bull dog he affectionately names 'meathead'  : p  7/10 . 
director/star clint eastwood's  " sudden impact "  is an intriguing addition to the  " dirty harry "  series - a combination of crude film-making and genius .  it's mediocre and silly in parts ,  brilliant and classic in others ,  with compelling ,  gripping pacing .  there are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot 'em up  " make my day "  scene recalls the  " do you feel lucky "  one ,  one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film's scorpio ,  an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as harry's partner - just to name a few .   harry callahan is still at odds with the higher-ups in the department ,  still mean ,  still tough ,  but now he's older and wearier .  his constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict - a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice ,  the two things not always being compatible .  this  " incompatibility "  is the underlying theme of the series .  the first film posed a simple question ,   " what about the victim's rights ?  "  -  ( do they outweigh those of the criminal ?  vice versa ?  depends ?  )  .  that film's answer was controversial ,  prompting a sequel  ( the highly enjoyable  " magnum force "  )  which set out to draw the line between harry's brand of justice and pure ,  heartless vigilantism .  dirty harry ,  like many of clint's other roles ,  is the personification of vengeance ,  the protector of the the defenseless .  this movie however brings it back to the victim ,  in this case jennifer  ( portrayed by sondra locke )  ,  who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now-incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men  ( and one woman )  who committed the crime .   without going into a play-by-play of the whole movie ,  i will say this - i mentioned earlier that  " sudden impact "  echoes the first film - it actually also sprinkles in little references and in-jokes from the whole series  ( the confusion concerning the captain's last name is an example - an intentional prank ,  i believe )  .  the relationship between callahan and jennifer is neat - has our rogue cop hero found a soul-mate in this lady vigilante ?  and is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister's tarnished rights ?  the exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series ,  one which i personally  ( as a fan )  found quite moving .  that last scene alone makes sudden impact the legitimate climax to the  " dirty harry "  collection ,  the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film .   ( not to knock  " the dead pool "  - that excellent movie was a relatively light-hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring harry callahan ,  rather than a character-defining film like this one )  .   this movie did well in the theaters - audiences in the reagan era found harry and his ilk quite appealing ,  and the president himself frequently quoted  " go ahead ,  make my day .

anyone witness to our justice system - or lack thereof will find this film truly satisfying .  there weren't too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot .  virtually every character in this film epitomized what is best and worst about our society .  the popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags along with the namby-pamby ,  lily-livered ,  melee-mouthed bureaucrats that empower them in the name of  " political correctness "  .    the performances across the board were compelling .  i sympathized with the rape victim - while at the same ,  found it gratifying to see her wipe the smug ,  vicious arrogance off the faces of her former attackers .  in particular ,  i found the dyke one of the ugliest characters in all of the films i've seen ,  so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good .  the lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly ,  so it was only fitting that dirty harry himself offed him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end .  this was the only sequel in the dirty harry saga that equaled the first . 
inspector  " dirty "  harry callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work .  refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of san francisco .  however ,  he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city ,  which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer .   as an entry in the dirty harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments ,  including the legendary  " go ahead ,  make my day "  line that eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery .  very badass and it just what fans can expect from him .  however ,  the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer .  the problem is that this killer isn't all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as harry is .  this really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with ,  pardon the pun ,  magnum force .   on the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to harry's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before ,  but fans that were looking for another badass harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed .  however ,  a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you don't mind something a little different ,  it is a good movie for fans .  --- 7/10  rated r for violence and a rape scene
it's a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly  ( if only in comparison to other films in its legacy )  ,  and others in a 'sub-plot' or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong .  sudden impact is one of those cases ,  where clint eastwood as star/producer/director shows when he can be at his best ,  or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crime/mystery/detective story in his dirty harry fame .  we get that 'make my day' line ,  and un-like in the first film where his 'do i feel lucky' speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails ,  here it's switched around .  he gets into another shamble with the department ,  as usual ,  when he tries to fight crime 'his' way ,  in particular with a diner robbery  ( inspiration for pulp fiction ?  )  and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus .  he's told to 'take a vacation' ,  and that's the last thing on his mind .  this whole main plot isn't very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines ,  which just adds to the frustration .  but soon his story merges with the sub-plot that eastwood develops from the start .   enter sandra locke's character ,  jennifer spencer ,  whom we soon learn after some  ( appropriately )  mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel ,  unjust sexual assault  ( err ,  outright rape )  ,  and is sleekly ,  undercover-like ,  getting revenge .  her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film ,  the most intense ,  and finally when it goes into callahan's storyline  ( he's getting facts in the same small town she's in on a murder )  ,  the film finally finds a focus between eastwood's classic form of clearly defined good vs .  evil  ( though sometimes blurred ,  to be sure )  .  eastwood films the flashbacks ,  not to say too much about them ,  expertly ,  in a fresh ,  experimental style ;  the trademark lalo schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others .  it almost seems like a couple of times an art-house sensibility has crept into eastwood's firmly straightforward storytelling style ,  which helps make the film watchable .   it's a shame ,  though ,  that in the end it goes more for the expectable  ( or maybe not expectable )  points ,  and until the third act callahan doesn't have much to do except his usual 'it's smith .  .  . wesson .  .  . and me' shtick .  however ,  with locke he gets out of her a very good performance  ( more subtle and touching than the one in the gauntlet )  and an exciting climax at an amusement park .  in a way i do and don't agree with ebert's remark that it's like a 'music video' in eastwood's style here .  i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both ,  the directness ,  but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video .  it's cheesy ,  it's hard-edged ,  it's not up to par with the first two 'harry' pictures ,  but hey ,  there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the  . 44 . 
***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** after two so-so outings  (  " magnum force "  and  " the enforcer "  )  ,  dirty harry seems to have regained his stride in  " sudden impact ,  "  a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths :  the charisma of clint eastwood ,  who also directed ,  and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes .   for once ,  the case takes harry outside his native san francisco  ( where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his  " shoot first ,  ask questions later "  tactics )  ,  to the hamlet of san paulo .  there ,   ( warning :  potential spoiler )  a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered ,  one at a time ,  by a woman whom they gang-raped years earlier ,  and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack .   the killer is portrayed by sondra locke ,  and she makes the character of jennifer spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness .  locke's cold eyes and frosty voice ,  when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists ,  are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit .   the rapists are a despicable lot ,  especially the leader ,  who has  " psycho nutjob "  practically stamped on his forehead ,  and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys ,  despite her anatomical inability to participate .  the flashback scenes ,  while not graphically explicit ,  are nightmarish enough ,  and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for jennifer as she kills her assailants .   some will dismiss  " sudden impact "  as trash :  a mindless ,  manipulative revenge tale .  on a certain level this is true ,  but it's well-done trash .  what works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the sondra locke performance ,  giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech .  what we have here is an action movie with a point of view .   you can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary ,  but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to harry  ( a realization that ,  wisely ,  is not spelled out with dialogue )  ,  he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate .  this makes the story more interesting than the usual dirty harry fare .   the movie's other redeeming quality is eastwood's direction .  this is ,  after all ,  a dirty harry movie ,  and eastwood knows the character better than anyone else .  the movie is directed with style and wit ,  and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff .  some of the best  " harry moments "  in the entire series are here ,  including harry's best-known line ,   " go ahead -- make my day .  "    " sudden impact "  is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow .  it is also a riveting detective story ,  well made and well told .  and it is certainly never dull .  on those criteria ,  it succeeds tremendously . 
with this movie being the only dirty harry movie which clint eastwood not only stars ,  but produces and directs as well ,  you know it's got to be good .  although some say that the enforcer is the best out of the series ,  i completely disagree .  in my opinion ,  apart from the original dirty harry ,  sudden impact and magnum force are the only two worthy of being in the series .  although the enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences ,  it doesn't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do .  this film captures all the excitement that makes a clint eastwood film good ,  and it's got the quotes that make a dirty harry film good .  in diry harry it's  "  .  . well do ya ,  punk ?  "  ;  in magnum force  " a man's got to know his limitations "   ;  and in this it's  " go ahead .  make my day .  "  also in this film it's nice to see a change of scenery ,  as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old san fransisco streets in the other films in the series .  with great acting by clint eastwood and co-star sandra locke ,  and good directing by clint ,  this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever . 
with harry callahan getting up in years ,  the inevitable `old man with a chip on his shoulder' story had to come into play eventually .  callahan ,  looking fragile sometimes and out of place ,  his demeanor still was unwavering .  thankfully ,  this film took some time off to develop a different type of story ,  one that might reinvent the dirty harry and the whole genre .  while the film fell short in doing so ,  it was still an excellent addition to the series ,  even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and new wave music . 
the dirty harry series began with very gritty cop action ,  and was almost immediately lightened up for  " magnum force "  .  by the time that  " the enforcer "  rolled around ,  dirty harry was little more than a television cop show  ( saved only by tyne daly )  .  after a break of seven years ,  dirty harry has finally gone back to his roots .  maybe he's been gone for too long this time .   clint eastwood makes the first well-directed harry film since don siegel made the first ,  which helps considerably .  harry is a darker character once again ,  not the nice cop he had become .  he can once again say things like  " go ahead ,  make my day "  and really mean it .   " sudden impact "  is a true dirty harry sequel .   " the enforcer "  should never have been made .   7 . 2 out of 10
the fourth in the  " dirty harry "  series ,  this film features one of the most despicable ,  ugliest ,  unlikable ,  profane ,  disgusting females i have ever seen on film :   " ray perkins ,  "  played by audrie neenan .  she is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945  " detour "  character ,   " ann savage .  "   her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up .  .  .  . and least some of her !  then i could enjoy the rest of the movie .   everywhere  " harry callahan "   ( clint eastwood )  goes ,  violence immediately follows .  .  .  .  . within minutes !  it happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving ,  entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one .   this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts .  .  .  .  . and connects ,  sad to say .  most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end ,  and who does it better than dirty harry ? 
sudden impact is the 4th of the dirty harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they don't really degrade in quality from one film to the next .  thus ,  sudden impact provides another thrill ride through the life of dirty harry callahan .  this time harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation .  harry's always on the job it seems .  clint eastwood plays harry as he plays all his men of action ,  slow ,  deliberate ,  and without fear .  as the first of the dirty harry films to be made in the 80's ,  sudden impact lacks a bit of the 70's feel that characterizes the first three films .  this doesn't mean that it's quality is any less .  bottom line :  brimming with intensity and action ,  sudden impact is another worthy addition to the dirty harry series . 
the vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences ,  inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift ,  sure justice ;  good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts .  it is ,  in fact ,  one of the things that has made the character of dirty harry callahan  ( as played by clint eastwood )  so popular .  he carries a badge and works within the law ,  but at heart ,  harry is a vigilante ,  meting out justice `his' way ,  which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors ,  as well as the criminals he's pursuing .  but it's what draws the audience ;  anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another ,  delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it-- even if it's only on the screen .  and that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done-- and quickly-- is one of the elements that makes `sudden impact , ' directed by and starring eastwood ,  so successful .  in this one ,  the fourth of the series ,  while working a homicide ,  harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work-- an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own ,  with one exception :  whoever it is ,  he's definitely not carrying a badge .   in his own inimitable way ,  inspector callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time .  so he does ;  as only `dirty harry' can .  in a small town north of san francisco ,  harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case ,  which he quickly links to a recent murder in san francisco because of the unique m . o .  employed by the perpetrator .  unaccountably ,  harry encounters resistance from the local police chief ,  jannings  ( pat hingle )  ,  who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere .  not one to be deterred ,  however ,  harry continues his investigation ,  which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist ,  jennifer spencer  ( sondra locke )  .  gradually ,  harry discovers a link between the victims ;  the burning question ,  though ,  is where does jennifer spencer fit into the picture ?   eastwood is in top form here ,  both in front of and behind the camera ,  and it is arguably the second best of the five-film series ,  right behind the original `dirty harry . ' it had been seven years since the last `harry' offering  ( `the enforcer , ' 1976 )  ,  but eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor .  and this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair ,  as he is able to recapture the essence of ,  not only his own character ,  but that `spirit' that made these films so successful ,  and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between #s 3 and 4 .  as with all the films he directs ,  eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end .    the screenplay ,  by joseph stinson ,  is well written and formulated to that distinctive `dirty harry' style ;  the dialogue is snappy and the story itself  ( conceived by charles b .  pierce and earl e .  smith )  is the most engaging since the original `dirty harry , ' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama ,  rather than entirely upon the action .  the characters are well drawn and convincing ,  and ,  of course ,  this is the film that gave us one of harry's best catch-phrases :  `go ,  ahead-- make my day .  .  . '  as harry ,  clint eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular :  he lives by a personal moral code ,  a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made america what it is today .  harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear ,  possibly more so today than ever before .  no matter who we are or where we come from ,  there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be harry ,  or at least have him around .  `dirty harry' is an icon of the cinema ,  and it's impossible to envision anyone but eastwood portraying him ;  for better or worse ,  eastwood `is' dirty harry ,  without question ,  just as sean connery is james bond and basil rathbone ,  sherlock holmes .   sondra locke is entirely effective here in the role of jennifer spencer ,  a young woman wronged and out for vengeance ,  or as she sees it ,  `justice . ' she manages to bring a hard-edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character ,  with a convincing ,  introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the `action' genre .  even amid the violence ,  locke keeps her focus on jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life .  her portrayal makes a perfect complement to eastwood's harry ,  and becomes ,  in philosophy and deed ,  something of his counterpart .   in supporting roles ,  two performances stand out :  paul drake ,  as mick ,  creates the best `psycho' since andy robinson's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original `dirty harry . ' with actually very limited screen time ,  drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing ,  which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience .  this is the guy you can't wait to see harry take care of in the end .  also effective is audrie j .  neenan ,  who makes her character ,  ray parkins ,  the epitome of the proverbial `low life , ' who can be found in any bar in any city .  it's a performance that evokes a gut-level response ,  and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film ,  in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism .   the supporting cast includes albert popwell  ( horace )  ,  mark kevloun  ( bennett )  and nancy parsons  ( mrs .  kruger )  .  with a perfect blend of drama and action ,  `sudden impact' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality ;  the perfect justice of a not-so-perfect world ,  that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience .  9/10 . 
when i first saw this film ,  in london ,  in 1958 ,  i was bowled over .  i had never seen a film like this before .  it had a strange ,  hypnotic effect ,  quite unlike the films that i had seen previously and it left a lasting impact .   i believe that odile versios & marina vlady are sisters ,  if not twins .  certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer .   if this has been converted to dvd - in region 2 format - and in the original french language ,  i would love to hear about it & where it can be purchased . 
 " toi le venin "  is robert hossein's masterpiece , and one of the great thrillers of the fifties . based on a frederic dard novel , a writer the director often worked with  ( see also  " le monte-charge "  which hossein did not direct but in which he was the lead too )  , the screenplay grabs you from the first pictures on a desert road by night where a beautiful blonde might be the fieriest of the criminals to the mysterious house where he finds his femme fatale  .  . and her sister . then begins a cat and mouse play  . one of the sisters is in a wheelchair  . but is she really disabled ? which one is the criminal who tried to kill the hero on that night ?    the two actresses , marina vlady and the late odile versois were sisters .   turn off all the lights before watching . highly suspenseful . 
strange enough ,  all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over .  i feel a necessity to confirm that this is a family work ,  since marina vlady was also robert hossein's wife ,  and the - excellent - jazz music was written by te director's father ,  andré .  under these circumstances ,  no wonder it was a really good thriller ,  seen when issued and immediately identified with the music .  the suspense was flawless ,  and maintained throughout until the end .  robert hossein ,  at the time one of the best european players ,  managed to impose himself also as a top screen and stage director .  he's still putting up great stage shows ,  with a preference for religious subjects . harry carasso ,  paris ,  france
we're talking about a low budget film ,  and it's understandable that there are some weaknesses  ( no spoilers :  one sudden explosives expert and one meaningless alcoholic )  ;  but in general the story keeps you interested ,  most of the characters are likable and there are some original situations .    i really like films that surprise you with some people that are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot  .  .  .  i applaud this one on that .    if you know what i mean ,  try to see also  " nueve reinas "   ( nine queens )  a film from argentina . 
an interesting thriller that has paul winfield as a detective on the case of a murder .  paul winfield was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease ,  it was hard to tell the man was even acting .  maybe most known by younger viewers as the voice/narrator of  " city confidential "  ,  winfield ends his career with a so-so movie ;  but as always ,  winfield shines .  a treat to watch .   erika eliniak is well ,  erika eliniak ,  nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department .  though ,  to be fair ,  this is one of her better efforts .   bottom line :  a watchable thriller that shouldn't be missed by any paul winfield fan .  a decent telefilm to help send paul winfield off to celluloid heaven .  what an actor .  he will be missed . 
it's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it .  i enjoyed it because i wasn't expecting what i was seeing ,  but an ordinary sex-drama so .  .  .  .  it's a pscyho-sexual thriller ,  in which nothing is what it seems .  it features emmanuelle seigner ,  no stranger to the genre  ( and to nudity )  in which her husband ,  polanski ,  had directed her .  and a creepy performance  ( did i say creepy/yes creepy )  from toreton  ( bernard tavernier's actor )  .  it looks like a pascal bruckner meets roman polanski  ( better than bitter moon )  ,  like a chabrol gone astray or clouzot thriller  ( i have seen someone mentioning les diaboliques )  ,  but closer to georges franju's les yeux sans visage  ( eyes without a face ,  the godfather of dr .  phibes and more )  .  a gem  !  i am just afraid they will blow this into a hollywood remake like they did with nighwatch and the vanishing . 
this is a quite slow paced movie ,  slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger .  the viewer slowly feels that there's something wrong here  .  .  .   i really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end .  it is clever ,  well paced and very well acted .  both philippe toretton and emmannuelle seigner are deeply into their characters .    the little son  " pierrot "  is also very touching .   a thriller which does not seem like one .  a very unconventional movie ,  very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of scenes .   i'll give it a 8/10  !  ! 
the last film in lucas' saga is a lavish ,  spectacular-looking production .  it is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy ,  but i think it is a notch above episode iv  ( and just a notch below episodes iii and v )  .  in fact ,  i think it is the third best film in the 6-part saga .  as far as i'm concerned ,  it is still a grandiosely entertaining film .  it is not a movie with a beginning ,  climax and ending ;  the film's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind :  bring closure to lucas' universe .  there is an air of finality attached to the whole thing ,  which makes the film a little too sentimental ,  but emotionally rewarding .  also ,  it is a lot of fun .  new characters are introduced and old ones face new ,  unexpected challenges .  c3po and r2d2 provide  ( as usual )  great comic relief .  leia and solo are a wonderful romantic duo ,  and luke is still a great character to identify with .  again ,  it is luke's  ( and vader's )  inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone .  lucas' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent ,  and the film's themes of loyalty ,  hope ,  and redemption resonate strongly .  i'm glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode vii ,  viii and ix ,  because this film is a great bookend to a long ,  fascinating and captivating saga .  not a perfect movie ,  but fun in the best matinée style . 
eglimata  ( = crimes )  is a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to the absolute disaster . one of the smartest greek series ever ! actors like ketty konstadinou and maria kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible 'guilty' laughing . every viewer seemed to recognise the bad side of their self in one of the characters or at least a side of their self they wish they had .  actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in greek audience's heart . my personal favourites  ( apart the first two i mentioned ) are vassilis haralambopoulos ,  athinodoros prousalis and stavros nikolaidis but so many amazing actors passed by some episodes from time to time .  whoever around the world understands greek should find a way to watch this series , even though it's been more than 5 years that it was on tv . in greece they keep repeating the series  ( ant1 )  in every chance there is like summertime or early afternoon zones . we'll never forget eglimata or any of the casting crew !

fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race .  all falls apart though ,  when young timmy's zombie fido eats the family neighbor .  from then on ,  disaster  ( well ,  maybe not disaster ,  but to some extent ,  chaos )  occurs .  most of the people treat their zombies with fairness ,  and one such character sleeps with his zombie  ( very funny part of the movie ,  if not also very disturbing too )  .  and we find the loving fido whatever he may do .  this is a very funny and unique film ,  especially for the zombie genre .  it is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies  ( no negativity in this statement )  .  i very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different .  i rate this 8/10 .  rated r for zombie related violence
 " fido "  is to be commended for taking a tired genre ,  zombies ,  and turning it into a most original film experience .  the early 50s atmosphere is stunning ,  the acting terrific ,  and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning .  suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars ,   " eisenhower era "  dress ,  art deco furniture ,  and zombie servants .  it would be very easy to dismiss  " fido "  as cartoon-like fluff ,  similar to  " tank girl "  ,  but the two movies are vastly different .   " fido has structure ,  a script that tells a story ,  and acting that is superior .  make no mistake ,  this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed .  highly recommended .  - merk
who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community ?  certainly not the makers of  " fido ,  "  who take us to a never-never-land version of the 1950's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class .  timmy robinson is the all-american boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom timmy has affectionately dubbed fido .  all of this has been made possible by zomcom ,  a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies  ( who were originally brought to  " life "  by radiation from outer space )  manageable and docile - at least most of the time .   this twisted ,  modern-day spin on the tv series  " lassie "  - it might easily have been entitled  " a boy and his zombie "  - takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre-'60s concerns as obsessive social conformity  ( here keeping-up-with-the-joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door )  ,  the sterility of suburban life ,  the corporate control of civic affairs ,  small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns .  the movie doesn't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs .  instead ,  this is a low-keyed ,  subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws .  much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community  ( life magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled death magazine )  .  despite some playfully graphic violence ,  the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950's itself and the cheesy ,  low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade .   k'sun ray ,  carrie-ann moss and dylan baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed timmy and his cleaver-esquire parents  ( with slightly sinister undertones )  ,  while billy connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse .   this is what  " lassie "  might have been had timmy's best friend been afflicted rabies . 
due to the invention of a  " the domestication collar "  ,  flesh-eating zombies are brought under control ,  and become productive members of society ;  however ,  they perform menial tasks .  the servile dead attend to those living in fenced us 1950s-styled small towns ,  while untamed zombies roam around in  " the wild zone "  .  in the town of  " willard "  ,  pre-teen k'sun ray  ( as timmy robinson )  lives with parents carrie-anne moss and dylan baker  ( as helen and bill robinson )  .  alas ,  the robinsons are the only family on their street who do not own a zombie ;  their new neighbors ,  the bottoms ,  have six .  so ,  to keep up ,  the robinsons obtain zombie billy connolly  ( as fido )  .   unfortunately ,  mr .  connolly's  " domestication collar "  is damaged by an old lady's walker ,  and he eats her ;  then ,  new and hungry zombies infest the town .  meanwhile ,  young ray has grown attached to connolly  ( the boy and his zombie are like tv's  " timmy and lassie "  )  and ,  the robinson family find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling  " zomcom "  authorities .     " fido "  doesn't go far enough into its own intriguing  " wild zone "  ;  but ,  it is a colorful ,  stylish ,  and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore .  ray and the cast perform well ,  individually ;  with nubile zombie sonja bennett  ( as tammy )  and owner tim blake nelson  ( as theopolis )  the most memorable pair .  director andrew currie and crew ,  including rob gray  ( design )  ,  jan kiesser  ( photography )  ,  don macdonald  ( music )  ,  and james willcock  ( design )  ,  deservedly won awards .   ******* fido  ( 2006 )  andrew currie ~ k'sun ray ,  carrie-anne moss ,  billy connolly ,  dylan baker
for the life of me ,  why did this film receive an r rating ?  !  while it is about flesh-eating zombies ,  believe it or not ,  it's actually a pretty good family-friendly film--at least if your kids are age 10 and older .  unlike the traditional zombie films ,  this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values--albeit a bit twisted !  the language isn't a serious problem ,  there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids  ( much like the old tv show  " eerie ,  indiana "  ) --yet some knucklehead slapped an r rating one it !  believe me ,  most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film .   the story is set in a parallel-type world .  while the fashions ,  cars and mores appear circa 1953 ,  in this bizarro world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the  " zombie war "  and massive changes in everyday life .  at school ,  kids are trained in armed combat and there's a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack  " just in case "  !  as for life outside of school ,  it's pretty weird as well ,  as people now have learned that zombies aren't such a bad thing !  heck ,  using shock collars and training ,  they can be made into slaves who can do your housework ,  clean streets ,  deliver milk or ,  in the case of a really sick guy ,  be your  " special friend "  .   this film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave  ( played by billy connally )  .  mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie's friend .  dad ,  on the other hand ,  isn't convinced--as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he hasn't yet gotten over this !  !  funny ,  irreverent and unique--this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience . 
i really enjoyed this movie .  the acting by the adult actors was great ,  although i did find the main kid a little stiff .  but he carried himself very well for being a new talent .  the humor is very sublime and not in your face like most hollywood comedy junk .  i . e .  the nutty professor .  if you have a short attention span and are used to the typical hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this as it is a bit slower paced .  i picked it up on blu-ray and i have to say the image quality is top notch .  probably one of the better looking blu-rays i've seen so far .  the extras were cool too .  they deleted quite a bit ,  but that's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything . 
in the immortal  " shaun of the dead "  ,  we are introduced to a london where the slackers and the high-and-mighty alike are forced to battle flesh-eating ,  reanimated corpse versions of their friends and family .  at the end of the film ,  it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour .   " fido "  presents us with an epilogue to  " shaun "  set in 1950's america ,  in a hilariously witty and original  " what-if .  .  .  ?  "  movie .   the film is set post-zombie-apocalypse ,  for a change ;  after the terrors of the zombie wars ,  ended by the creation of the zomcon company and their patented zombie collars which make the corpses as docile as lambs .  every town in the world is fenced off from the wild zone ,  the once-fertile landscape torn asunder by the surviving zombies and left-overs from the apocalyptic wars .  the idyllic town of willard is your typical ,  pristine 50's suburbia ,  with one small difference ;  social status is measured by a family's amount of domesticated zombies .  unfortunately ,  the robinson family has no zombies whatsoever ,  due to their patriarch ,  bill's ,  fear of the reanimated dead .  timmy robinson and his mother helen both suffer from the pressures of suburban life ,  until the day that helen purchases a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the neighbours .   the zombie earns timmy's love when he rescues him from a pair of violent bullies ,  and the two form a bond to rival the classic  " boy-and-his-dog "  cliché .  .  .  a boy and his zombie .  timmy names his  " pet "  fido ,  and he soon becomes an aid for both timmy and helen to escape the prison-like routine bill has put them in .  but when fido's domestication collar goes on the fritz and he devours the elderly mrs henderson ,  the robinsons have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still manage to keep their beloved fido .   a film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its all-star cast  ( including  " the matrix " 's carrie-anne moss as helen robinson and billy connelly as fido )  ,   " fido "  is a zom-com for the ages .  with some rather twisted subplots - for example ,  the sweet and unsettling feelings that helen and fido begin to have for each other - and a poignant commentary on 50's suburbia and the zombie genre ,  the film manages to bring out the worst  ( and the best )  in its characters while still enabling you to care for them .    " fido "  is ,  by far ,  one of the best dark comedies i've ever seen ,  one of the best films that i've seen in a long time ,  and the best zom-com since the incredible  " shaun of the dead "  . 
up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga ,  which finally ended in 2005 ,  i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series .  the varied action scenes and really different characters  ( jabba the hut ,  furry woodland creatures ,  etc .  )  made this a particularly appealing movie .   none of the action ever focused too long in one spot ,  either .  the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between luke skywalker and darth vader .   another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars .  gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford .  finally ,  everyone was on the same page !  it was nice to see .   in the end ,  this was simply a wonderful adventure tale ,  more than anything else . 
i was also on hand for the premiere in toronto .  this film was sort of a consolation when i thought i wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice .  well ,  i was totally blown away .  by the time i got to the theater i could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie  ( yes ,  i actually forgot who was even in it .  )  terrific performances from the entire cast .  carrie-anne moss was great in a true departure from her days as trinity .  as for billy connolly ,  i think not since chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what-so-ever .  the kids were also great .  definitely check this one out if you get the chance .   and ,  by the way ,  i got to see my first choice anyway- and this was way better . 
fidois a very odd film .  and in many ways ,  a very good one .   my first thought after viewing ,  was how the hell are they going to market this thing ?  if shaun of the dead is a romantic comedy with zombies ,  fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies .  doesn't exactly trip off the tongue .   fido has little of shaun's carnage ,  gore & belly laughs .  it is a different beast altogether  ( forgive the pun )  .   fido kicks off with a black & white information film that explains the back story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh-eaters into dumb servants .   at first i thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la matinée ,  but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle-class nostalgia .   young timmy robinon is a lonely kid who doesn't fit in at school .  his mom is would-be social climber , and his dad is nervy and detached .   seeking to keep up with the joneses ,  mom  ( carry-anne moss )  has acquired a zombie .  jimmy is disinterested at first ,  but 'fido'  ( billy conelley )  soon proves a great buddy for jimmy .  until his collar goes on the blink .  .  .   fido is not a horror film ,  but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it is .   much of the humour is of the light family variety ,  and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dog/family moments .   yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark ,  truly funny moments ,  which while welcome ,  will ensure an r rating for what is ,  for extended periods ,  a family comedy .   the film looks gorgeous ,  and is wonderfully performed by all involved .   despite its difficult tonal problems ,  i hope this movie finds a niche ,  as it's quite a little gem in this year's deluge of cinematic crap . 
i watched fido on some movie channel and i have to say that i've become an instant fan .  the film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s ,  you know the wholesome decade when they danced to elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it .  people were so naive back then that it's frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here .   kudos to this canadian production ,  the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast ,  including carrie anne moss ,  billy connolly ,  henry czerny and the kid .   it's a shame this film wasn't a bigger hit .  it deserved more recognition .  it's much better than the stuff from tim burton or the shaun of the dead team .  oh well .  it's an instant classic nonetheless . 
in an alternate 1950s ,  where an outbreak of the undead  ( caused by a mysterious 'space-dust' )  has been contained through the use of special electronic collars ,  a young loner ,  timmy ,  finds a friend in fido  ( billy connelly )  ,  his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie .   fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to timmy ,  whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son  ( or for his hot-to-trot wife ,  played by the gorgeous carrie-anne moss )  having been psychologically scarred as a child  ( when he was forced to shoot his own father ,  who tried to eat him !  )  .   timmy runs into a spot of bother ,  however ,  when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink ,  and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour .  with the authorities on fido's trail ,  trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies ,  and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help ,  will timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend ?   a refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick ,  fido is a thoroughly entertaining ,  deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour .  taking the romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town america is a stroke of genius ,  and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that i have seen .   connelly's fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame ,  along with day of the dead's bub ,  and return of the living dead's tarman ;  it is not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse ,  but the big yin's performance is so fine that i actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus !  the rest of the cast also give commendable performances ,  with young k'sun ray  ( as timmy )  and ms . moss deserving special mentionsray ,  because ,  for one so young ,  he puts in a particularly assured turn ,  and moss because she is so bloody yummy !   this is the third zombie film that i have watched this week  ( the others being the somewhat disappointing planet terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead )  ,  and ,  to my surprise ,  it is also the best .  director andrew currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future .   8 . 5 out of 10 ,  rounded up to 9 for imdb . 
loved it !  what's not to like ? --you got your suburbia ,  you got your zombies ,  you got your family issues ,  you got your social dilemmas ,  you got yourself one fine retro-1950's-style flesh eating under class held at bay by an uneasy worried about whether they're the next meal upper crust .  you couldn't ask for more .   cast is superb .  carrie ann moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife .  she's both wanton ,  and criminally conspiratorial .  every fellow's dream .  k'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence ,  and somehow succeeding .  he's a genuine screen presence .  very photogenic ,  and natural .  without naming them all ,  the rest of the cast is wonderful .  henry czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it's his everyday persona .  billy connolly is delightful as fido .  a fine actor :  i wish that he had played the title role in  " braveheart ,  "  with gibson directing .  my sense is that his william wallace would have been closer to the actual character .  his fido is contained ,  yet accessible .  a nice touch .   in short ,  a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals ,  values ,  social pinnings ,  feelings ,  growth ,  coping in uncertain times ,  and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions .  a true reality show . 
even without speaking a word ,  billy connely is wonderful as a zombie .  .  .  carrie ann moss as  " mom "  ?  ,  even better .  zombie girlfriends ?     "  .  .  . my father thied to eat me .  .  .  i never tried to eat timmy .  "    and i thought dawn of the dead was good .  it's kinda like airplane meets  ( meats ?  )  night of the living dead ,  sponsored by zomcom .  .   and don't forget my head coffin  and fido in an aloha shirt is just way cool !   and yes ,  the social comment is just too much to even begin to comment on .    sufice it to say ,  it all really works ! 
ok ,  i didn't know what to expect when i saw the cover to fido ,  honestly when i came across it in the video store i was tempted to rent this movie ,  but nothing about it really grabbed my attention .  but when i was looking around in netflix ,  they were advertising this like crazy if i liked  " goofy "  scary movies ,  so i figured to just give it a shot .  i'm so glad that i did watch it ,  this was just a great movie ,  it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch .  like i said ,  it's pleasantville meets night of the living dead ,  it's just a great concept ,  what does happen after a mega zombie attack ?  as we see in another zombie comedy ,  shaun of the dead ,  they have fun by making the zombies left over as  " handy "  citizens .  this is a very overlooked horror/comedy movie ,  i think a lot of people were just so blown away with shaun of the dead that this got the boot .  but it's a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie .   in a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies .  this radiation still plagues humanity ,  as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead .  in order to continue living normal lives ,  communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named zomcon .  zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies' hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants .  in the town of willard ,  a housewife  , helen ,  buys a zombie in spite of her husband bill's zombie phobia .  their son ,  timmy ,  befriends the zombie ,  naming him  " fido "  .  one day fido's collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor ,  who turns into a zombie .  timmy  " kills "  the zombified neighbor .  when a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor ,  they capture fido and timmy .  helen comes and rescues timmy and fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing .  several days later ,  the neighbor's body is found and the murder is traced back to fido ,  who is taken away to zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed .  timmy learns through a friend that fido is simply working in a factory at zomcon .  timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get fido back .   i really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it ,  it's so silly but a lot of fun .  billy connelly did a great job as fido and really brought ,  no pun intended ,  a lot of life into the character .  i think the scene that made me laugh the most was when timmy has to burry the old lady that fido attacked and killed ,  his last words to her were so funny ,   " you weren't really nice ,  but you liked flowers ,  so "  and he buries her in the garden .  not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend ,  sick ,  disturbing ,  wrong ,  but classic laughs .  i still love how even though this is like the leave it to beaver-esquire type of world ,  there still is a lot of gore in the movie .  so if you do have a chance to see fido ,  take it ,  i promise some good laughs .   9/10
as soon as i heard about this film i knew i had to check it out .  well ,  i heard about it ,  then i found the trailer .  after that ,  that's when i knew i had to see it .  and i am so glad i did .  you want to see classic television mixed with zombies ?  no ?  then get lost .   fido is a movie unlike anything i've ever seen .  well ,  actually ,  it kind of is .  it's kind of like a lassie episode and a zombie film .  though when combined ,  it feels completely new and original .  fido is about a little boy named timmy and his new pet fido .  well this new pet ain't no squawking parakeet or some potty-trained puppy .  it's a re-animated dead guy .  .  . a zombie .  a large radiation cloud engulfed earth which led to all of the dead rising ,  which ensued the zombie wars .  though through the genius of reinhold giger ,  lead scientist of zomcon ,  he discovered that if you destroy the brain ,  the zombie will perish ,  thus giving us the edge and the win in the zombie war .  though due to lingering radiation ,  whoever dies becomes a zombie .  which can be a problem especially with the elderly .  though zomcom steps up again with more breakthroughs ,  especially with the domestication collar .  the collar stops the zombie's need for human flesh and thus making it harmless as a household pet .  but not all is perfect in this zombie utopia ,  collars break ,  old people die and .  .  .  . well i'll just let you watch this incredibly unique flick .   fido is a fantastic idea brought to fruition .  with an all-star cast ,  and great writing fido rises above most in the comedy/horror genre .  there are plenty of funny and original situations that really had me entertained .  though after seeing the film ,  i personally think the movie would have been better in black and white .  at less than 90 minutes ,  the movie doesn't go on for too long and moves from scene to scene at a good rate .  it'll probably end up being a cult-classic of sorts ,  since it's not really a laugh out loud comedy or even a horror movie .  it's a comedy/family/zombie film immersed in the 1950 vibe .  if you thought anything i said here was interesting by all means check this film out .  but if you're still on the fence ,  swing your leg back over and stay there .  8 . 5 outta 10
when you see the cover of the dvd you're convinced this is some class b cheesy cheapie ,  a film made for $1 , 000 in somebody's backyard .   wrong !    this is quality material and really good .  it's a comedy and a clever one at that .  it also is very touching in spots ,  with a nice spot of kindness .  the production values are very good  ( this looks excellent )  ,  the actors are known ,  the film's direction and sets are great .  it's amazing .  who would have thought ?   carrie-ann moss ,  playing against-type ,  is terrific ,  as " helen robinson ,  "  the june cleaver-like wife ;  billy connolly is great as the grunting good-hearted zombie  " fido ;  "  tim blake nelson  (  " mr .  theopolis "  )  is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend  " tammy ,  "  and henry czerny and dylan baker as dads  ( check )  are excellent ,  too k'sun ray as young  " timmy robinson ,  "  shouldn't be overlooked ,  either .  in fact ,  he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone .   if i explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it .  you'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very ,  very pleasant surprise .  you need a dark sense of humor ,  though ;  an appreciation of the absurd . 
when it comes to creating a universe george lucas is the undisputed master and his final star wars film is very ,  very good  ( and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga )  .  having recently seen revenge of the sith really puts this movie in perspective .  the final battle seems even more climactic knowing what anakin skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the emperor .  it also makes the final battle between luke and vader more bitter considering the love he felt for padmé and the love she felt for her children .  actually while the new films  ( especially episode ii )  are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only .  they make the old films seem even better .   mark hamill does an exceptional job in this movie .  he really brings the changes luke has gone through seem real .  in all fairness i believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job .  harrison ford is still good .  however ,  you can feel that he has done raiders and blade runner in between the two final chapters of star wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit .  he adds more comedy  ( obviously inspired from raiders )  to the character which works brilliantly .  in short han solo is better than ever .  carrie fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable .  ian mcdiarmid appears in this film and having seen episode iii i can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever .  james earl jones still provides the voice for vader and he is still very ,  very good .   in terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the star wars universe looks better than in either of the previous  ( two )  movies but this was always lucas' forté so that is really to be expected .  the final battle over endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise .  it was also a nice touch that lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax .    the only thing i feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the ewoks .  these little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in .  besides i find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of storm troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery .   all in all return of the jedi is a very good movie but the fact that richard marquand is a less accomplished director than irvin kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant .  also george lucas' stupid decision to add the ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance .   8/10
my goodness .  this movie really really shows the talents of actors .  billy connelly flexes his acting muscle .  truly an amazing man ,  if you look at him in absolution as a rebel ,  boondock saints as a madman/killer ,  and then finally in fido as a zombie !  his character in fido looks from cute to frightening ,  absolutely fabulous !  cariie ann moss is no hack either !  jumping in career from matrix and momento as a darker character ,  to a heart warming conservative 1950's housewife !  rare these days to see actors being able to not be so type-casted .   now onto the storyline  ( no spoilers ,  don't worry )  .  this movie would make max brooks  ( author of zombie survival guide & world war z )  happy with joy !  finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy .   if you like zombies ,  if you don't like zombies ,  if you are just bored ,  or if you are too busy ,  go see this movie ! 
this film takes place in the 1950s .  according to this the dead  ( called zombies )  have arisen to eat the living .  however a company has developed a collar that ,  when put around the zombies neck ,  makes them docile and perfect servants .  the robinsons mom helen  ( carrie-anne moss )  ,  dad bill  ( dylan baker )  and son timmy  ( k'sun ray )  hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one .  tim names the zombie fido  ( billy connolly )  and becomes friends with him .  but his dad hates him and timmy looses control of fido and things go wrong .   as you can see this is--among many other things--a takeoff on the  " lassie "  series with fido being a stand in for lassie .  timmy was named that for a reason !  every single of the famous lassie episodes are spun here .  my favorite is when timmy sends fido off to get help before the zombies eat him !  also it's a satire of those 1950s douglas sirk films where everything is bright and colorful--but dark secrets are tearing people apart .  the characters wear very bright 1950s clothes  ( moss is always in a dress ) --the furnishings ,  settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors .  even when the script becomes repetitious there's always something to look at .  the script is good--but there are only so many lassie jokes you can make .  the melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off .  everyone here is excellent and right on target .  even connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job .  moss is the best--playing each line for all its worth---but never going overboard .   this isn't for everybody  ( of course )  .  the satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame .  the gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it's hard to take it seriously .  so ,  for some people ,  this will really work .  i give it an 8 . 
a long time ago ,  in a galaxy far ,  far away .  .  .  .  . there was a boy who was only two years old when the original  " star wars "  film was released .  he doesn't remember first seeing the movie ,  but he also doesn't remember life before it .  he does remember the first  " star wars "  themed gift he got .  .  . a shoebox full of action figures from the original set .  he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be .  but years later ,  he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received :  another box full of action figures ,  ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection .  it's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed ,  anakin skywalker ,  stopped being produced and carried in stores ,  and how this boy went for about ten years  ( until he got into college )  trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets  ( don't ask .  .  . it's a northern illinois university thing )  .   i can't review  " star wars "  as a movie .  it represents absolutely everything good ,  fun and magical about my childhood .  there's no separating it in my mind from christmases ,  birthdays ,  summers and winters growing up .  in the winter ,  my friends and i would build snow forts and pretend we were on hoth  ( i was always han solo )  .  my friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house ,  and that served as the ewok village .  they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it ,  and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yoda's home .  i am unabashedly dorky when it comes to  " star wars "  and i think people either just understand that or they don't .  i don't get the appeal of  " lord of the rings "  or  " star trek "  but i understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because i am a rabid fan of george lucas's films .   i feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time .  every time i put them in the dvd player ,  i feel like i'm eight years old again ,  when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going to track down a figure of anakin skywalker .   grade  ( for the entire trilogy )  :  a+
and this somebody is me .  and not only me ,  as i can see here at imdb or when leaving the theater .  why did the people love it ?  it's obvious :  everybody knows zombies by now  ( at least the horror fans by heart and the others through the  " dawn of the dead "  reinvention or resident evil movies etc .  )    or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies  .  .  .  that is until this movie came along .  and you'll see zombies in a new light  ( perhaps )  .  this is not a horror movie ,  although it does contain some violent scenes ,  but is rather a comedy .  a satire to be precise .  and it never runs out of steam !  that is why i rated it so high .  pacing wise it's incredible ,  the acting is great and the script has no  ( obvious )  mistakes  .  .  .  quite the contrary :  it's a gem and if you're only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it !  and even if you dislike them ,  watch it !  because it's a great  ( comedy )  movie ! 
a year or so ago ,  i was watching the tv news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area .  since then i have paid particular attention to this movie called 'fido' as it finished production and began playing at festivals .  two weeks ago fido began playing in my local theater .  and ,  just yesterday ,  i read a newspaper article which stated fido is not attracting audiences in it's limited release ,  with the exception of our local theater .  in fact ,  here it is outdrawing all other shows at the paramount theater ,  including 300 .  of course ,  this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make-up .  and for any other locals who haven't seen fido yet but are considering it ,  i can say there are many images on screen ,  from the school to city park to the forbidden zone ,  that you will recognize .  in fact ,  they make the okanagan valley look beautiful .  that's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie !  however ,  fido itself is a very good movie .  yes ,  despite its flaws ,  it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market .  fido is best described as an episode of lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead .  this is a clever premise .  and the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950's emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold-war paranoia which led to mccarthyism .  furthermore ,  it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which george romero first introduced in day of the dead .   k'sun ray plays a small town boy who's mother  ( carrie-ann moss )  longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block .  however ,  his dad  ( dylan baker )  is against the idea as he once had to kill his own 'zombie father' .  eventually ,  the family does acquire a zombie named 'fido'  ( played by billy connolly )  ,  and adjusts to life with the undead .  billy connolly was inspired casting .  he is able to convey fido's confusion ,  longing ,  hatred ,  and loyalty through only his eyes ,  lumbering body ,  and grunts .  connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones .  this is his best role since mrs .  brown .   fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as shawn of the dead and zombie honeymoon .  being someone who appreciates bruce campbell and misty mundae movies more than eli roth and jigsaw ones ,  i prefer humor over gore in my horror .  however ,  i understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough 'undead carnage' in fido .  yet ,  i am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humor .   the movie does break down in it's third act .  it's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the 1950s ,  they forgot about the story arc .  however ,  given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen ,  i rate fido 9 out of 10 . 
this is the first must see film i've seen in the last year !  it's wickedly funny ,  incredibly original ,  unbelievably great looking  ( they went for this super cool wide-screen technicolor look that's awesome to behold ,  )  and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society .  it's really smart satire that nails everything from homeland security to race issues ,  while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear .  carrie anne moss turns in a comedic performance i never imagined would come from her !  she's sweet ,  funny and sexy !  billy connolly is great as fido who can only grunt and moan !  and dylan baker as the dad is priceless .  in fact the whole cast is perfect .  henry czerny as the bad guy ,  tim blake nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend  ( getting the idea now ?  )  funny ,  though-provoking and just all round amazing !  go and see this movie !  it's like nothing you've ever seen before . 
set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of willard in the 1950s ,  this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such american obsessions as gun mania and violence ,  materialism and keeping up with the joneses ,  fear of others ,  slavery ,  golf ,  and the disposing of the dead .  yes ,  it all sounds a bit heavy ,  but trust me on this ,  it's nearly as light as a feather .   zombies are featured prominently among the characters .  crucial questions arise ,  such as :  who will become a zombie  ( 90% of the willard folks choose this final path ,  while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral )  ?  who owns how many zombies to do their bidding like robots  ( they've become a mark of social status )  ?  and ,  what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead ?    somehow ,  director andrew currie ,  who also co-wrote the lively screenplay  ( with robert chomiak and dennis heaton )  ,  keeps this improbable material percolating along for an hour and a half without once faltering for want of a good laugh .  a super cast helps :  carrie-anne moss ,  billy connolly ,  dylan baker ,  henry czerny ,  tim blake nelson ,  mary black and sonja bennett are the principals ,  aided by young k'sun ray as timmy ,  the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups .   ( having seen her only in  " memento "  and  " the matrix ,  "  i had no idea that ms .  moss had such fine comedienne chops .  )    the production design and music are exquisitely 50s ,  to a tee .  maybe this one isn't for everybody .  it surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual bizarro award .  but intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie-making .  for me anyway ,   " fido "  is a hoot !  my grades :  8 . 5/10  ( a- )   ( seen on 01/30/07 ) 
fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition ,  especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days .   as has already been pointed out ,  this is hardly a real zombie film ,  but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers .  while there are necessarily some bloody scenes ,  there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented  ( feel-good 50s style )  ,  i can't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by fido & his fellow sufferers .   while the cast is generally good ,  i felt that moss and nelson stood out .  the humor is not in-your-face ,  but rather subdued ;  there's a lot of attention to detail and i caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie .  this is certainly no masterpiece of cinema ,  but it doesn't strive to be - instead ,  currie succeeds in delivering a heart-warming black comedy . 
saw this movie at the vancouver film festival and thought it was deadly smart ,  stylish ,  and funny .   the cast was rock solid .  great work by carrie anne moss ,  dylan baker ,  tim blake nelson ,  billy connelly and up and comer ,  alexia fast .   weirdly ,  i found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it .   writers ,  dennis heaton ,  robert chomiak and andrew currie layered in a lot of political subtext - but didn't whack you over the head with it .   the world they created had depth ,  and made sense .  there is a giddy carnivorous spirit to this movie .   fido is guaranteed to cure grumpiness .   loved it !  !  ! 
just saw the world preem of fido at the toronto international film festival and thoroughly enjoyed it .  here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered  ( certainly 'fleshed out' extensively and successfully )  by george romero .  but this is a canadian film by a canadian director and it's a comedy !  and ,  yes ,  i actually think it is better than 'shawn of the dead' .  thoroughly believable and ,  perhaps even more importantly ,  enjoyable performances by dylan baker ,  carrie-anne moss and young actor k'sun ray ,  whom i suspect we'll be seeing a lot more of in future features .  however ,  i must confess that i most enjoyed the delicious turn by tim blake nelson as neighbour mr .  theopolis ,  essentially playing a willing animated version of victor van dort from the corpse bride  ( or ,  for those who've seen the film ,  wouldn't that read even better here as the corpse pride ?  )  and ,  of course ,  scotch actor billy connolly in his least animated ,  yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character .  just think ,  he would not have gotten this role had it not been for peter stormare's commitments to prison break  ( as was revealed in the q&a following thursday night's screening )  .  i can't help but speculate that the screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from day of the dead's zombie 'bub' . i am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a comment and i won't start now .  suffice it to say that fido is not one of those dour ,  graphically gory zombie films you can rely on from romero .  rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and ,  although  ( and i did have to think back carefully to be sure )  there is a fair dose of blood-letting and violence ,  the delectable humour ,  so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by director currie and his co-screenwriters ,  goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated pg-13 .  i urge you to go see this little canuck gem .  i'll certainly be buying the dvd once it emerges hopefully by next summer . 
at a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious ,  on first viewing i'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'shaun of the dead' .  now ,  given i view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius ,  i realise this is a rather big claim .  and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'fido' will appeal to you .   in a way the comedy picks up where 'shaun' left off ,  except we're back in the original 1950s living dead-era stereotypical middle-american small town .  the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted ,  useful members of the community .  this ,  so we're informed at the outset ,  is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps ?    the beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose .  the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect .  themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living ,  keeping up appearances ,  repressed emotion ,  muddled parental values ,  social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual .   it's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all-round strong cast .  it's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part .  it's also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been like .  .  .   so in conclusion ,  it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you . 
i suppose the ultimate curse of attending the toronto film festival is your release date time table get messed up .  quite frankly ,  i'm just happy fido got picked up for us distribution .  in any case .  .  .   ever seen shaun of the dead ?  good .  how about lassie ?  able to reconcile the two ?  well ,  if you can your name might be andrew currie ,  canadian helmer of the first ever family themed zombie comedy ,  or zomedy .   ( seriously ,  that's what the press book in toronto called it .  )  though not as violent ,  dry ,  or british as shaun of the dead ,  fido remains true to its roots :  a devotion to old 50s black and white television including both lassie and the infamous sci-fi pulp that was being pumped out during the period .   fido's talented headliners  ( carrie anne moss ,  billy connelly ,  dylan baker ,  and tim blake nelson )  stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script .  the film explores all the implications of its premise :  a world where zombies have been converted to servants because of the sheer number of them due to a strange accident .  what would you use your new undead servant for ?  a butler ?  manual labor ?  a pet ?  unspeakable acts ?  fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way ,  with much thanks to the work of connelly  ( as one of said zombies )  and young tv actor k'sun ray ,  who seems at times to be a better young elijah wood than the young elijah wood was .   if you're expecting another shaun of the dead ,  don't waste your time .  there's not nearly enough gore and pokes at the genre to satisfy you and you'll just leave the theater bitter and depressed .  but if you're willing to take a look at what happens to shaun of the dead when it jumps across the lake ,  you're in for a treat .  think of fido as the sensitive ,  more often beaten up little brother to shaun of the dead's rebellious loser ,  and you're starting to get the drift .  if you like  ( or at least tolerate )  zombies ,  small children ,  and loads of deadpan satire ,  fido's the film for you .  if that's not the case .  .  .  . well ,  you know the drill .  just hit 'em square between the eyes . 
those french and those germans sure have a long history of not liking each other .  it is interesting to note that kamerdaschaft or comradeship in translation takes place in 1931 .  only a few years later ,  hitler would siege germany and begin his plans to take over the world ,  france being a casualty of his ambitions .  but these are times of sereneness compared to the future .  a group of miners at the border try to cross over to france to get work .  they are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their french neighbors .  then a disaster happens in the mines of the french and a well-crafted and written scene ,  a troupe of german miners decide to come to the rescue .  a simple story is it not ?  pabst was a poet of silent cinema and i am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not ,  but his poetry is there to be discovered .  he isn't fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal .  ther is even a flashback to a wwii event that beckons the point of this story .  supposedly based on a real event ,  the movie does the events proudly with directness and terseness .  smetimes ,  that's what a movie needs to be . 
sentimental and naive but undeniably affecting ,  emotional man-helping-man plea ,  in this case personified as german and french miners forced to be closed off from each other after the great war thanks to a new border ,  leading to disillusionment on the german side ,  as the french are the bosses .  but when a fire begins on the french side ,  the common decency of the german men lead to assistance ,  safety and even friendship .  this was a plea that would fall on deaf ears within the decade ,  as a certain man from pabst's own side would break that piece and turn the great war into merely a prelude .  but it is obvious to me that pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism ,  as this film radiates with this optimism whereas his more flippant ,  cynical adaptation of the threepenny opera lacked the bite needed to make that work work .  also furthering his honest belief are the fact that the characters here are not simplistic mouthpieces for positions ,  but real people ,  with real families whose home lives we are privy to as well .  these are ordinary ,  working-class men who just happen to believe in the worth of caring and treating right your fellow man ,  and in this day of individualist opportunism ,  i'll take a little thinning in my plot to get a positive message that represents a point of view that i think we can all aspire to .    ( note :  apparently the ending is cut on most prints ,  where the french rebuild the mining gate ,  closing off the men once again .  this is a brutal turn of events ,  and may have made the film a better overall film ,  but i would have lamented it souring the positives vibes of the final sequence ,  so in short ,  i'm glad it was clipped .  )  {grade :  8/10  ( b )  / #7  ( of 11 )  of 1931}
valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this director's distaste for war .  the audience not only learns a great deal about early mining rescue procedures but ,  we learn that europeans at the interval between wwi and wwii ,  had concerning pacifists ( for lack of a better term )  .  the speeches given by both representatives of each country at the end of the film ,  are inspiring given the time .  although the revised edition ,  through the transfer technology of early foreign films ,   " cuts-off characters heads "  at times ,  this film holds it's own in many different aspects .  character analysis ,  lighting techniques ,  historical content and a scenario that has tested and inspired many a writer and filmmaker .   pabst went on to direct and put to screen weil & brecht's  " three penny opera "  ,  starring the original star ,  lotte lenya . 
this film ,  along with westfront 1918 ,  are my favorite pabst-directed films and i enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred louise brooks  ( such as pandora's box )  .  it's probably because both are very similar to the neo-realist films that the italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s .  this style film called for using non-actors  ( just typical folks )  in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films .   in this case ,  the film is about french and german coal miners ,  so appropriately ,  the people in the roles seem like miners--not actors .  the central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the franco-german border .  instead of one big mine ,  it is divided at the border and german workers are not welcome in the french mine ,  despite there being greater unemployment in germany .  this ,  language differences  ( illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene )  and wwi conspire to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a we vs .  they mentality .  later ,  an explosion causes a huge collapse in the french and the germans refuse to sit back and do nothing .  risking their own lives ,  they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general .   the film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried ,  in vain ,  to get the german audiences to see the futility of war and hatred .  it was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images i have ever seen .  considering history ,  though ,  the film's impact was minimal at best .  it's a real shame ,  as like this one ,  westfront 1918 ,  jáaccuse  ( gance )  and all quiet on the western front  ( milestone )  had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion .  so ,  from a historical point of view ,  it's an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing . 
based on an actual mining disaster ,  this early german talkie  ( with english subtitles )  still remains one of the most effective docu-dramas ever filmed .  featuring many non-professional actors ,   " kameradschaft "  gives a chilling view of the friendship that binds the mine workers ,  regardless of which side of the french/german border they may be from .  a deadly accident brings out the very best in everyone ,  nullifying any superiors' orders .  a fellow miner in need will receive the help of his comrades ,  even at threat of great loss ,  including life .   this film reminds of the self-sacrificing heroism shown by the nyfd following the 9/11 attacks .  putting aside any formal rules and regulations ,  these men and women in uniform knew only one cause :  to save lives ,  and to find their fellow-fire fighters .  -- more than 70 years later ,   " kameradschaft "  still has the strong and timeless message :  a friend in need is a friend in deed . 
the name of this film alone made me want to see just what it was all about ,  so i taped this film during the early hours of the am .  if you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through during the early days and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine crumbles in on the men .  this film clearly wants to show that germany and france can work together and be friends after ww i and how the germans came to the aid of the french miners much to the unbelief of the french townsfolk .  the actors were all outstanding ,  with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy who worked in the mine .  there is an old old retired miner who manges to go down the mine by ladder when the elevator breaks down .  if you are a real film buff ,  this is a film you will not want to miss . 
this ,  the finest achievement from georg wilhelm pabst's social realism period is based upon a tragedy in early 1906 that claimed the lives of nearly 1100 french miners as a coal dust explosion deep in mines at courrieres in northern france took place after a fire had smouldered for three weeks ,  eventually releasing deadly pit gas that brought about the fatalities .  estimable designer erno metzner creates stark sets that simulate the tragedy ,  providing a perception of reality ,  augmented by matchless sound editing ,  with the only music being produced by integral orchestras during the beginning and ending portions of a work for which aural effects possess equal importance with the eminent director's fascinating visual compositions .  pabst's manner of  " invisible editing "  that segues action from shot to shot through movements of players proves to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film that also showcases sublime cinematography utilizing cameras mounted upon vehicles ,  enabling the director to shift amid scenes without having a necessity of cutting .  although the work's cardinal theme relates to socialist dogma ,  the unforgettable power of this film is held in its details ,  born of pabst's nonpareil skill at weaving numerous plot lines into a cinema tapestry that stirs one to admiration for german rescue squads of whom their fatherland is greatly proud while no less despairing of disastrous losses to the families of french victims ;  certainly ,  a seminal triumph fully as stimulating today to a cineaste as it was at the time of its first release . 
brown of harvard is a hard movie to pin down .  we expect a lot more from our movies these days ,  so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent .  william haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and ,  even ,  glory .  all of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted except for the homoerotic tie between billy and jack pickford ,  the town nerd .  the movie has everything ,  romance ,  tears ,  love ,  death ,  and even sports .  .  .  it's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century . 
this is apparently the second remake of this film ,  having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918 .  and ,  in so many ways it reminds me of the later film ,  a yank at oxford .  both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both ,  ultimately ,  show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency .  in this film ,  william haines is  " tom brown "  and his main rival ,   " bob "  is played by frances x .  bushman .  and ,  in a supporting role is jack pickford--always remembered as the brother of mary .  of these three ,  pickford comes off the best ,  as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom's pal--he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game !  all the standard clichés are there and the movie ,  because it was done so many times before and since ,  offers few surprises .  however ,  it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing .   in my opinion ,  for a better silent college film ,  try harold lloyd's the freshman--it's football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown .  the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era .  another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again  ( such as in westpoint and the smart set ,  among others ) --and if you've seen one of these films ,  you've seen them all .  well made ,  but certainly not original !  and ,  because it is just a rehash of his other films ,  anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other films .   4/25/08==i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the 1920 !  !  talk about over-rated !  there are dozens and dozens of better films--how this film got to be #1 is anyone's guess . 
i've been intrigued by this film for a while ,  in part because of the extremely high score here on imdb -- a 9 . 0 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film !  how had i not heard of this film before this website ?  well ,  you can't always trust the ratings .  this is actually a very good film ,  preserved quite well if the fine vhs transfer i rented is any indication -- excellent acting by the principals ,  especially william haines as brown ,  and good location work at cambridge with some fine action footage in the climactic harvard/yale football game -- but the story must have seemed a hoary chestnut even in 1926 .  obnoxious ,  self-centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place ,  becoming in the process a caring ,  self-sacrificing friend ;  i doubt people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few reels ,  the predictability factor is high .  still ,  it starts out very well ,  and is certainly deserving of being remembered ,  if not praised to the heavens .  maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly harvard men .  .  .   edit now 600+ voters and the score has actually climbed to 9 . 2 !  seriously ,  folks ,  there is ballot-stuffing going on here - i defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than  " metropolis "  or  " the general "  ! 
i'm sick of people whining about ewoks !  true ,  they're not the best thing that ever happened to star wars ,  but they did happen ,  so deal with it !  besides ,  they are cute ,  and i don't care if they're marketable .  yubb nubb !   this movie always leaves me in tears .  it's perfect .  the end could not be better .  i'm excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to anakin .  i love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way .  so those of you who are complaining that vader's helmet was removed ,  take a moment to think about it .  it's very effective .  vader ,  the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years ,  is finally revealed as a sick-looking man .  he is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable .   i don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in a new hope .  they all do so well .  they are believable characters .  hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development .  fisher does a fine job being a female role model  ( i mean ,  come on !  she killed jabba even when so many others had failed !  )  .  harrison ford - need i say more ?   the music is once again brilliant .  it's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie .  the best climax is when luke shouts  " nooo !  "  and jumps out to fight his father in the final battle .  john williams is nothing short of a genius !  what an amazing man !   already ,  the movie has so much more meaning for me because of episode i .  i can't wait to finally see it in the theatres  ( can i wait ?  ?  ?  )  and then watch the original trilogy yet again .   bravo ! 
this is an extraordinary film ,  that tricks you constantly .  it seems to be heading toward cliche at several points ,  and then something astonishing will happen that genuinely startles .  it would give away too much to say much more ,  but stick with this film and you will be richly rewarded .  william haines is absolutely delightful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be re-discovered .  the gay subtext in his relationship with jack pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where haines rubs pickford's chest  ( pickford has a cold )  .  both actors play this sub-text subtlely and with great depth of emotion ,  so that there are moments that are very moving .  and i never thought i could get so involved in a football match as i did in this movie - and i don't even understand the rules !  also excellent is francis x .  bushman's son ralph as haines' rival for the girl  ( yes ,  it's not completely a gay movie )  .  wonderful silent classic - a great example of twenties commercial cinema with an edge . 
one of the biggest hits of 1926 ,  brown of harvard is a exciting comedy/drama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave william haines the role he needed to become a major star .  it's patented haines all the way :  brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone wises up and becomes a man/hero and wins the girl .  no one worked this formula like haines .  a terrific comic actor  ( little annie rooney with mary pickford ,  show people with marion davies )  ,  haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression .  he is a total joy in this film as he was in tell it to the marines  ( with lon chaney )  and west point  ( with joan crawford )  ,  where he repeats the formula .  mary brian is good as the girl ,  jack pickford is very good as the sickly roommate ,  ralph bushman is the rival .  edward connelly ,  mary alden ,  david torrence ,  guinn williams ,  and grady sutton co-star .  this film is noted now for its homoerotic relationship between haines and pickford and for being john wayne's film debut as a yale football player  ( but i never spotted him )  .  haines was a top-five box office star starting with this picture through 1932 .  it's a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost .  he was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time . 
a family  ( mother-patricia clarkson ,  father-jake weber ,  son-erik per sullivan )  go out for a family get together in some remote house in the middle of winter .  they accidentally hit a deer while driving there .  this angers some of the locals--especially otis  ( john speredakos )  and things slowly  ( very slowly )  go wrong .   i was expecting the worst when i started watching this .  the bulk of the reviews for this ,  on this site ,  are extremely negative .  well .  .  . i disagree .  first off it's not a horror film .  the horror doesn't even begin until the closing 30 minutes .  it plays more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in .  on that level ,  it's pretty damn good .   first--the bad stuff :  the pace is way too slow ;  jake weber is a horrible actor ;  way too many false dream sequence scares ;  the wendigo barely figures into the film and the clear view we get of the wendigo at the end is laughable .   the good stuff :  pretty good dramatic script ;  clarkson is excellent as the mother ;  some great direction with eerie sound effects which are a little scary ;  a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between clarkson and weber  ( which actually is necessary for the integrity of the plot !  )  ;  pretty good acting by sullivan  ( only 10 at the time !  )  and speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending .   i think many people are annoyed with this film because it's being pushed as a horror film--which it isn't .  so ,  if you can ignore that ,  i think you might like it .  i'm giving it a 7 . 
if you want scream or anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother .  this well-written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say .  importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense ,  how children interpret the world  ( and the violence in it )  ,  our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends .  .  all here ,  but not flatly on the surface .  you could technically call it a  " monster movie "  even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end ,  and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit/beast .  some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores ,  though in fact the less you see of the creature ,  the better .  fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out . 
this movie is excellent .  i found it very interesting .  i thought the wendigo legend was pretty cool .  the acting was also great ,  as well as the costumes ,  production ,  photography ,  directing and script .    a very happy family ,  on vacation gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer .  a huntsman then appears and is very angry and outraged over the fact that one of the deer's antler's is broken .  he then starts to stalk the family and weird things start to happen to them .    see this movie .  it's worth it .  kudos to the cast ,  crew and filmmakers .  two thumbs way up ! 
wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller ,  the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes .  the acting is good ,  the characters act like a normal family .  the wendigo effects are good ,  the deer form reminded me a little of the rabbit in donnie darko .   the film sees a family going to stay at a house for a while but accidental hit a deer ,  a group of hunters arrives and one of the hunters named otis starts to argue with the dad george ,  after the car is lifted they drive off to the house .  the son miles is a little shook up about the deer but his parents try to tell him that it's natural for things like that to happen .  that night while he's in bed he starts to see weird things in bedroom ,  the next day they go into to town and miles meets a man at the counter who gives him a little statue of the wendigo ,  when miles shows kim the statue and tells her that a man at the counter gave it him the owner says the she only works there .  once returning home george takes his son sledding and while there sledding he's knocked off the board and miles is chases by the wind ,  after gaining conciseness they go looking for george ,  they find him outside the house where he tells them he was shot ,  in the hospital kim tells the sheriff that otis may have shot him ,  the shrieff goes to otis's place where he's bashed over the head with a hammer ,  as otis drives down the road he finds that the wendigo is after him .   wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has some chilling moments .  check this out .  10/10
now this is what i'm talking about .  finally ,  a low-budget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage .  wendigo ,  while occasionally flawed ,  is a triumph of the imagination .  granted ,  it leans heavy on evil dead style camera moves for its moodiness ,  but it's still a damn sight better than 99% of direct to video dross .   the story is pretty simple :  a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and are menaced by one particularly unhinged hunter .  but director larry fessenden really knows how to build suspense and add layers of unsettling creepiness through the use of the mythical wendigo .  is it real ?  is it all in the boy's imagination ?  is it an externalization of the child's emotional state ?    some have quibbled that the film is unsatisfying because it's left to you to decide .  don't be put off by such petty nonsense .  a film that makes you think is not one to avoid .  it's one to rejoice in . 
a haunting piece that the discerning horror film fan will fall upon with gratitude .  keep your freddys and your jasons -- this film is in the same company as  " the haunting "   ( the original )  .  lyrical and truthful ,  it stays with you long into the night ,  much like those terrifying cbs radio mystery theatre shows .  a smart rent . 
perspective is a good thing .  since the release of  " star wars episode i :  the phantom menace "  ,  claims and counter-claims of just how episode's ii and iii will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' star wars films ,  making them part of a cohesive whole ,  rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies .  what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films .  this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy :   " return of the jedi "  .  often derided for its overly 'cute' factor ,  rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect  " the empire strikes back "  .  indeed the 'cute' element of rotj ,  namely the ewoks ,  remains a weak link in the entire series .  did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities ?  only he can answer that question .   this cute factor aside ,  the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga .  following on from the conclusion of  " the empire strikes back "  ,  luke skywalker  ( mark hamill )  follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine ,  his home planet ,  to rescue han solo  ( harrison ford )  ,  the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debts .   skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben 'obi wan' kenobi  ( alec guiness )  to fight the evil empire .  now swathed all in black ,  luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn .  his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest .  while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends ,  he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again ,  despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperor's side .   early scenes in tatooine are impressive ,  from jabba's lair ,  to his floating palace and the 'almighty sarlac' - an intenstine that lives in the sand .  lucas' cgi enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac ,  making it look fake and overdone .   the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding ,  and is one of the more memorable of the saga .  luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies ,  proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost complete .   when luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time ,  the viewer is let down by yoda's distinct lack of screentime .  undoubtably the star of  " the empire strikes back "  ,  yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke's destiny is played out on screen .   rotj really is luke's film ,  perhaps even more so than the original .  his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate .  the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow .  the romance between leia  ( carrie fisher )  and solo is all but non-existant ,  unlike in  " empire "  .  in fact only leia's character is developed in rotj ,  solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films .   their roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion .  this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction .  the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all ,  while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside  ( or is that replace ?  )  darth vader .  the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film ,  less cunning than governor tarkin  ( peter cushing )  from  " star wars "  ,  more deeply psychologically dark than anything else .  played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid ,  the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate .   all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles .  hamill surprises as the more wisened luke ,  making his character's progression from whiny teenager ,  impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series .  ford's role is waring thin ,  as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the real star of the first film after all .  fisher's leia is more of a prop ,  at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about .  .  .  add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi ,  yoda and the loveable chewbacca ,  c-3po and r2d2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast .   despite the film's corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire ,  it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence :  on endor ,  in space and on the death star ,  each with very impressive special effects .  the music ,  as always ,  is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance .  just as the 'blue danube' worked perfectly for  " 2001 :  a space odyssey "  ,  john williams' score is as much a part of  " star wars "  folklore as light sabers and the force .   lucas left the ending open to interpretation ,  meaning there could have been more episodes made .  indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii ,  viii and ix in their heads over and over again .  rotj works when given a chance ,  and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series .   when all six episodes get to be viewed together ,  this saga could well be the best ever made .  is it already ?  the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series .  this is why  " return of the jedi "  can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release . 
if you want scream or anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother .  this well-written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say .  importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense ,  how children interpret the world  ( and the violence in it )  ,  our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends .  .  all here ,  but not flatly on the surface .  you could technically call it a  " monster movie "  even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end ,  and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit/beast .  some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores ,  though in fact the less you see of the creature ,  the better .  fessenden successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out . 
this film is more about how children make sense of the world around them ,  and how they  ( and we )  use myth to make sense of it all .  i think it's been misperceived ,  everyone going in expecting a stalkfest won't enjoy it but if you want a deeper story ,  it's here .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
george and kim are traveling with their young son miles to a remote cabin in upstate new york when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch . but what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey , where myth becomes reality and a flesh-eating spirit , half animal and half man wendigo , haunts a small town .  .  .  " wendigo "  by larry fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often tenderfoot's into a somber family drama . the acting is great , the characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling moments . the subtle glimpses of wendigo are handled effectively and it's never clear what is real and what is imagined , or even if the story is taking place entirely in miles' head . overall ,  " wendigo "  is my first contact with larry fessenden's work and surely won't be the last . give this film a chance , if you don't mind watching something unconventional . 8 out of 10 . 
i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10 ,  but that this one isn't even in the top 100 .   this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks ,  but there are so many reasons to love this movie :   -the rescue of han solo from jabba :  this official wraps up the han solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in a new hope .   -the emperor was finally revealled :  well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kids .   -the speeder bike chase :  alright ,  so this was a special effects moment .  but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films !   -the 3 part climax :  1 )  the battle of endor  ( led by han and leia )  2 )  luke confronts his father & the fall of the emperor 3 )  the destruction of the second death star  ( lando's moment )   -the final celebration with our heroes :  like i said ,  this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire ,  our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other .   all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story . 
from the first scene ,  i was really excited .   " i can tell this is going to be awesome !  "  i thought .  the acting was so good ,  i felt as though i was eaves-dropping on these peoples' lives .  the music too was exquisitely unsettling .  the plot started with a sudden event and then drifted forward  ( one could sense )  toward some irrevocable fate .  the build was slow ,  but i personally love that kind of thing ,  as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesn't get derailed before it's ready to pay off .   so everything's going fine ,  and then the fireworks begin ,  and before you know it ,  the credits are rolling .   " what ?  !  !  !  "  was all i and my movie-night companion could say .  if you understand the director's intentions ,  the blunt ending does make sense  ( for those of you who have seen the movie already ,  check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with larry fessenden at filmcritic . com )  ,  but i can't help saying it was not pulled off quite right .   this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax .  in any case ,  it's too bad .  those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world .   ( but for those of you who don't write or make films ,  you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a huge pain in the butt ,  and i am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal !  )   wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished .  but hay ,  i'd take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over-produced piece of dog-poo over-compensated with too many digital effects  ( like most horror movies these days )  .   one other comment .  some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether i should be scared or laughing .  i don't know how to explain it ,  but there was a distinctively monty python feel about this monster in his more blatent  " monster "  forms .  although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie--i don't know ,  it still worked for me in some crooked way .  i will never look at deer antlers in the same way again !   :  ) 
**possible spoilers**  the biggest part of the movie that doesn't work is the wendigo ,  and when your title character fails ,  your movie usually isn't far behind it .  the filmmakers' interpretation of the wendigo's form is interesting ,  and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror ,  for instance - and the tree-form was actually very good .  however ,  as a monster character it never really comes to life .  we don't get much of an explanation for its behavior ,  and what we do see from it doesn't jibe with either the story told in the movie itself ,  or any wendigo lore i've ever read .   i think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it isn't given enough to do ,  in the movie .  when you boil this film down to its bones ,  what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element ,  instead of a movie about a monster .   the cinematography is good ,  though a little cheesy ;  the filmmakers use scenery ,  lighting ,  and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well .  the character of otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable ,  making him the real monster in the film .  it might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the wendigo ,  which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend .   i have heard unconfirmed reports  ( from a newsgroup )  that the reason the wendigo doesn't do much is that ,  when the monster suit was built ,  it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable  ( in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves ,  the performer had to walk on his toes )  that it was nearly impossible to run ,  walk ,  or otherwise perform in it .  thus the many flashes of the creature standing still ,  and the obvious sped-up footage of it running .  i stress that these reports are uncomfirmed . 
a solid b movie .   i like jake weber .  his understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances .  i liked the relationship between the father and son .  i liked the family dynamics .  the wendigo looks silly ,  but it is a representation of the kid's toy and the dead deer .  it's an amalgamation like ,  see ?  this is a psychological story ,  not a freddy slash em up instant gratification flick .  watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and you'll be fine .   nice work . 
this is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word 'horror' in order for it to be appreciated .  the main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and ,  as with most younger children ,  he gets frightened easily .  mainly because he simply doesn't understand things ,  like why his father is hardly ever there for him .  from watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it ,  but the little boy doesn't .  also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods ,  as it is established early on in the film ,  that the family is from the city .  also ,  in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer ,  then get held up ,  then they argue with the locals about it ,  and the little boy surely didn't find this introduction to the woods pleasant at all .   the  " wendigo "  is ultimately what his young ,  innocent mind fabricates to explain all of this .  there is the american indian legend ,  but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it ,  it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically .  not because that's what the wendigo actually is ,  but because that is how he understands it .  when you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it .  obviously it was low-budget and shot cheaply ,  but the jumping montages ,  use of light ,  and general eeriness more than make up for it .  and the final question the film asks is :  is it all in your head ,  or is it really out there ?  8/10  rated r :  profanity ,  violence ,  and a sex scene
if you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore ,  tons of jump-scare moments and unrelenting ,  escalating scenes of excruciating death ,  then look elsewhere .  if you like quiet ,  moody ,  thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread ,  then wendigo is for you .   thoughtful ,  stressed out george ,  his psychoanalyst wife kim and their young son miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city .  on the way up ,  george hits a stag with his car .  the hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that george has ended their chase .  in particular ,  deranged hunter otis takes it personally .  he follows the family to their vacation home ,  making sure they see him .  he spies on george and kim as they have sex .  he fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren't home ,  letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return .  when kim takes miles to the drugstore in town ,  miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case ,  carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag .  a native american man tells miles that this is the wendigo ,  a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry .  miles takes the figure home with him ,  already haunted by the death of the deer the day before .  that afternoon ,  when he and his father go sledding ,  george is shot and miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed .  .  . or is he just in shock ,  and imagining the whole thing ?  hours later ,  george is rushed to the hospital and miles ,  still clutching his statue ,  either faints ,  dreams or goes on a vision quest ,  in which the wendigo returns .  this time the angry ,  flesh eating god - part tree ,  part stag and part man - is hunting for otis ,  who has finally gone over the edge .   wendigo is a beautifully made film ,  almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees .  okay ,  so the monster itself is kind of fakey-looking ,  but it's a small flaw ,  more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film ,  and the eerie backdrop of the silent ,  snowy countryside .  the performances are great ,  particularly by jake weber as the moody and thoughtful george and patricia clarkson as his sweet but no-nonsense wife .  they are a happy couple with their share of common problems ,  and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful .  watching this film is often like watching someone's home videos ,  so realistic are the performances .    this movie is not for everyone .  a lot of people may find themselves totally bored ,  waiting for the hideous lovecraftian beast and bloody revenge that never come .  we can never really be sure if the wendigo even exists ,  seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also ,  later ,  through the eyes of a madman .  this is more a psychological drama than a horror film ,  but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror . 
larry fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum .  well ,  the worst mistake ,  evidently ,  is the marketing of the movie and the way the dvd might have been targeted .  obviously ,  this is not a true horror movie ,  at least ,  not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying .     " wendigo "  is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young miles .  things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend .  it is obvious that kim ,  the mother ,  is a psychologist ,  but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son .  this is also a story of alienation .  it's clear that the father ,  george ,  is a distant figure ,  perhaps a workaholic ,  who seems to be living in a different world .   miles' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country .  that part of new york state ,  with its winter landscape ,  barren trees ,  play havoc on the little boy's imagination .  it doesn't help that he encounters a strange figure in town ,  it creates even more doubts in his young mind .  ultimately ,  miles' world comes crashing down on him and he can't do anything ,  even evoking the wendigo spirit .   the film is well paced and acted .  patricia clarkson is excellent ,  no matter where movie she is in .  jake weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he doesn't understand .  erik per sullivan ,  as miles ,  conveys the inner turmoil within him .  i thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is miles own take on what's going on around him .  finally ,  john spredakos is perfect as the menacing otis ,  a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out .   instead of putting this movie down ,  future viewers should approach it with a open mind . 
kim  ( patricia clarkson )  ,  george  ( jake weber )  and son miles  ( erik per sullivan )  are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from manhattan's bustling metropolis .  on the way ,  they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow .  a group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along .  rather than helping ,  at least one of the hunters ,  otis  ( john speredakos )  ,  is mad because the accident cracked the buck's antlers .  george ,  kim and miles are disturbed by otis ,  and even worse ,  we quickly learn that otis has learned where they're staying .  meanwhile ,  miles is given a wendigo  ( a kind of indian shape-shifting spirit/monster )  token by an indian whom only he has seen .  is otis a psycho out to get our heroes ?  are there wendigos in the woods ?    i can see where wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers .  it is a fairly low budget film ,  with technical limitations frequently showing through .  much of the film ,  and maybe all of it ,  is not really about the titular creature .  and perhaps the fatal blow for many people ,  it has a very ambiguous ending ,  with a number of questions left unanswered .  if you are discouraged by such endings ,  and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant ,  do yourself a favor and avoid wendigo .   personally ,  i like films like that .  i usually prefer some ambiguity .  the marketing of wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick ,  scary creature flick ,  where they'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end ,  and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for wendigo 2 :  the monster returns ,  but that's not what this film is .  wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people .  heck ,  writer/director larry fessenden even has a character ,  george ,  reciting robert frost .  the frost poem ,  and george's comment that frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things ,  is the key to the film .   one of the best things about the film is its complexity .  in a way ,  there are four different films occurring at the same time ,  a thread from each character .  in george's thread ,  he isn't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world ,  and he has some parenting problems .  for him ,  the film is a realistic ,  horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse .  in patricia's thread ,  she's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family .  she's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her ,  hoping that they'll go away and get better .  in otis' thread ,  he's even more down on his luck than george ,  and george's arrival into his life symbolizes the final  " crack "  in his psychological armor .  and in miles' thread ,  which is probably the most important of the film ,  life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world .  but this is a horror story ,  after all ,  albeit one with a glimmer of hope ,  and the events in the film give miles' poetic interpretations a dark turn .  still ,  when everything is said and done ,  he seems to be the only one retaining his composure ,  due to the poetic outlook .   even though the film is low budget ,  there are a lot of well-executed higher budget ambitions .  fessenden and director of photography terry stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations ,  and created some interesting slide show like montages  ( such as the cards ,  or the indian wendigo images from the book )  .  there are also interesting more traditional montages ,  such as miles' nightmare .  wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films .   other technical aspects are good for the budget .  the  " wendigo "  appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous .  the lighting was usually good--there were a few times that dark scenes weren't as clear as they could have been ,  but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock  ( it could have been digital instead )  or transfer .  i thought the performances were good and far more realistic  ( if you value that )  than the majority of films .  although i didn't really notice the score ,  it must have been okay ,  or i would have noticed it with a negative judgment .   overall ,  wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions ,  as long as you don't mind having to think about the movies you watch . 
good sequel to murder in a small town .  in this one cash and his police lt .  buddy unravel a sticky plot involving a nazi criminal ,  a philanthropic witch ,  and a family of screw-ups and their wierdo helpers .  as in the original ,  the viewer is treated to a nice little mystery with distinctive sights and sounds of pre-war america .  go see it . 
pleasant ,  diverting and charming .  the best part is the swing numbers ,  especially the rendition of my buddy ,  partial though it may have been .  the acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by wilder is so pleasant it is hard not to enjoy this film . 
fortunately for us real mccoy fans  ( most likely all baby boomers who grew-up in the late 50's and 60's )  ,  three of the adult actors/actress appeared when they did for the reunion show ,  in 2000 .  tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter .  as enjoyable as it was to see luke ,  sugar-babe ,  and pepino together again ,  it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman ?  it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999 ,  but i'm not sure how .  there is no information about hassie on the internet ,  that i can find .  very curious why they were not even mentioned ?  it was so conspicuous ,  their absence from the reunion show ,  that i suspect that the family of michael and lydia herself  ( if still alive )  either ,  1 )  requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted ,  or 2 )  tnn could not find any trace of either michael or lydia  ( like the rest of us )  ,  they seemed to have vanished .  therefore ,  it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together .   otherwise ,  the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done .  they made no bones about it  .  .  .  it was grandpa who made the show such a success .  i remember ,  as a child ,  mimicking grandpa's gimp walk and my parents laughing  ( as i'm sure a million other children did back then )  .  one annoyance that did bother me a bit ,  was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion  .  .  .  at times interrupting tony and kathleen to make a point .  in fact ,  although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation ,  he was not allowed to speak-out and say too much during the reunion show .  unfortunate ,  since i wanted to hear from all three ,  equally .  all in all ,  the reunion show was a real treat for me .  i've watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each time .   dodgerdude
this is just one more example of the absolute genius of gene wilder .  he wrote and starred in this terrific mystery .  no one could have done it better .  the suspense was palpable throughout .  i wish mr .  wilder would grace us with another of these .  i have enjoyed everything i have ever seen mr .  wilder in but i had no idea how truly talented he was until i saw  " murder in a small town ,  "  and this follow-on .  he truly has a firm grasp on what audiences want and how to deliver it in his writing and ,  of course ,  in his brilliant acting .  his subtle wit comes through in spades .  i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and/or gene wilder's film work .  his star just gets brighter and brighter . 
 " the lady in question  ( 1999 )  "  starring gene wilder is a well-acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black-and-white raymond burr perry mason series .  both perry and  " cash "  kept me guessing right up to the end .  there were many suspects with a motive for the murder ,  but i had no idea which character it would be .   gene wilder has a special charming wit about him ,  even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections which make him perfect for the part .  the portions of the movie which portrayed actors acting was done very well .  i'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off .  i am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie .  even his singing was a delight .  i like him in this role more than his former  " sillier "  roles like  " the young frankenstein "  and  " willy wonka .  "  i am hoping a & e will continue this series .  they ought to call it something like  " the a & e gene wilder mysteries .  "   the music fit the period .  i enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes .  i was a little unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or whether the action was taking place in that time period .  and i do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script .  to me ,  that always distracts .   overall ,  my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well-crafted start in what we hope will be many others -- just like one of our other favorites :  raymond burr's perry mason . 
a delightful if somewhat predictable tv movie ,  though i admit a little bias -- as far as i'm concered ,  the more gene wilder in this world the better .  i'd love to see numerous additional movies detailing the adventures of larry  " cash "  carter ! 
as a 90 minute experience ,  it is not up to the standard of `drive' ,  as the actors clearly learnt their trade at the `who am i ? ' academy ,  while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb mark dacascos beat 'em-up .  however ,  those who enjoyed `drive' ,   ( and i thought it was wonderful !  )  ,  will undoubtedly enjoy this too .  you certainly won't rewind back to the start and watch it all again ,  but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come .    it is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being practiced ,  even if not in hong kong ,  and i would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets ,  time and respect afforded to the likes of yuen woo-ping and corey yuen kuei .  if you sit through the first half hour and aren't sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat .  bosch is magnificent ,  and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics ,  kicks and simple acts of bravery .    if you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy ,  then track it down and watch it .  it's not shakespeare .  in fact ,  it's less articulate than coolio in `china strike force' ,  but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team -  ( i'm pretty sure there's no safe way to land directly on your head ,  or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speeding car !  ?  )  .   
this movie has great fight scenes .  now its true that the acting is a little rough .  but if i wanted to see a movie based on acting skills i would watch a cheesy movie like american beauty .  but if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix .  then watch this .  now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie .  but hey the fight scenes are enough to make jet li p**s his pants .  and the stunts are worthy enough for jackie chan to sit threw and admire . 
robert urich was a fine actor ,  and he makes this tv movie believable .  i remember watching this film when i was 15 ,  and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same .  people lose who they were when enter this exclusive club ,  in a computer rich californian town .  urich try's to figure out what is wrong with his family ,  and i love the halloween space suit idea ,  brilliant .  this film is about the battle of one's sprit .  tv quality ,  that exceeds ,  the big budget ,  gangs of new york .  i wonder if robert urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie ?  i hope so !  6 or 7 out of 10 . 
everything is idyllic in suburbia when the little family moves in ,  as the father have got a new job in a computer company there .  but no paradise would be complete without its snake .  strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband ,  as it certainly holds secrets .  the father is not a joiner ,  but pressure is on him to join ,  as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members .  robert urich's good guy part is a bit tepid ,  but joanna cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles .  suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy susan lucci as club chairperson .  look out for cult favorite michael berryman in a bit part as a valet .  the movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for .  i have seen this movie quite a few times . 
a classy film pulled in 2 directions .  to its advantage it is directed by wes craven .  on the downside the tv film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget .  it moves along as susan lucci draws robert urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club .  his latest invention ,  a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood .  anyone seeing this should pay attention to susan lucci .  her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later .  the actor ,  scientist and parapsychologist stephen armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film .  lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called catherine .  lucci and barbara steele's portrait in 'black sunday' were used as references for the catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by armourae .  probably due to a personal nature between the artist and catherine .  so by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film . 
i will admit ,  i thought this movie wasn't going to be any good but i soon changed my mind .  the movie was keep you guessing as which direction it's going .  pierce broson is amazing in his role as a hit man ,  who suddenly becomes burned out & asks a man he met at a mexican bar for help .  greg kinnear is an awesome straight man ,  as his role as a mild mannered man from denver ,  who starts a innocent conversation with pierce at a mexican bar .  the movie will have you laughing as pierce delivers hilarious one liners  ( mostly about sex )  .   the imaginary in this movie is very well done ,  especially at the bullfight scene & when pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs . 
better than the typical made-for-tv movie ,  invitation to hell is blessed with excellent casting  ( urich ,  lucci ,  cassidy ,  mccarthy ,  pre-murphy brown joe regalbuto ,  soleil moon-frye )  and a high concept update to the familiar faustian plot .  urich is likable as always and lucci is particularly fetching and devilishly over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles .  kind of a hybrid version of stepford wives and they live ,  the movie commits early to its apocalyptic miltonesque vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the soppy ,  maudlin denoument .  7/10
when the scientist and family man matt winslow  ( robert urich )  finally accepts the invitation to work the micro-digitech corporation in a space suit project ,  he moves with his beloved wife patricia  ( joanna cassidy )  and their son robbie  ( barret oliver )  and daughter chrissy  ( soleil moon frye )  to a huge modern house in the corporation compound .  they meet their friend tom peterson  ( joe regalbuto )  and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle ,  and tom invites the winslow family to join the steaming springs country club .  tom tries to seduce matt telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric professional ascension in micro-digitech ,  but matt is not tempted with the offer .  later he is introduced to the director of the club ,  jessica jones  ( susan lucci )  that befriends patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children .  matt feels the changing in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club ,  finding an evil secret about jessica and the members .   in the 80's ,  when i saw  " invitation to hell "  ,  i liked this movie that partially recalls  " the stepford wives "  ,  with people changing the behavior in a suburban compound .  i have just seen it today ,  and i found a great metaphoric message against the big corporations ,  when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries .  i am not sure whether the author intended to give this interpretation to the story ,  but i believe it fits perfectly .  my vote is seven .   title  ( brazil )  :   " convite para o inferno "   (  " invitation to hell "  ) 
its no surprise that busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity ,  this film is also a poor decision ,  but one i enjoyed fully .  the first 5 minutes is the most uninspiring 5 minutes in any film ;  boring ,  bad dialouge ,  and then ,  with a spiderman stance ,  busey yells the best-worst line in any film ever created .  .  .  " your worst nightmare butthorn !  "  i coughed up some of my egg nog laughing so hard .  that line resonates so well ,  it even tops clooney's infamous  " hi freeze ,  i'm batman "  line .  other classic moments is busey constantly getting upset for people reminding him that he got his ex-cia partner killed .  .  . which he did by accidentally shooting him in the chest  ( all made possible by a super slow-motion flashback sequence that makes watching paint dry seem exciting )  .  there's an ashtray to the nads ,  punches to the face ,  and a  " that wasn't my fault and you know it !  "  well ,  the footage shows him missing the bad guy and hitting his buddy ,  so .  .  .  other scream out-loud moments has to be his ex girl-friend dropping a grenade to the ground to enable his escape--a plan that defies all logic ,  physics ,  and absurdity .  and lastly ,  when mcbain jumps out of the thunderblast during intense guerrilla warfare and starts to run and hurdles a small object ,  i almost wet myself .  some of busey's best work by far ,  rent or buy it today  " butthorn !  "  my vote is a perfect 10  ( on the poo meter that is )  . 
i didn't have many expectation going into the film ,  but i thought it was fantastic .  pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role .  he has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor .  pierce and greg kinnear play off each other great ,  and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time .  the humor is dark ,  the performances by brosnan ,  kinnear ,  and hope davis are great ,  mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship ,  and you have a great film .  this is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time .  this is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-bond era of brosnan's career . 
gary busey is the title character ,  frank  " bulletproof "  mcbain ,  your standard-issue reckless maverick cop who's earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes  ( 38 and counting )  ,  he never stops going after the bad guys .   when a cutting-edge u . s .  tank dubbed  " thunderblast "  is driven across the border into mexico ,  it's nabbed by revolutionaries / terrorists led by general brogado  ( rene enriquez )  and libyan colonel kartiff  ( henry silva )  ,  who's aligned himself with russian villains .  the army personnel involved are kept as prisoners ,  chief among them devon shepard  ( darlanne fluegel )  ,  who happens to be mcbain's ex-girlfriend .  mcbain is then recruited by the army for a rescue mission .   busey may not have the physical presence of say ,  someone like schwarzenegger ,  who would have been another appropriate lead for a film of this type ,  but he's a blast as a self- confident dude who's quick with the wisecracks .  fluegel is a great female lead ;  she not only looks incredibly sexy but makes for a fine butt-kicking action babe .  enriquez ,  silva ,  juan fernandez ,  and the always welcome william smith  ( as a russian major )  are loathsome scum in the classic action movie tradition .  the supporting cast is quite full of familiar and reliable character actors :  l . q .  jones ,  r . g .  armstrong ,  thalmus rasulala ,  lincoln kilpatrick ,  mills watson ,  luke askew ,  danny trejo ,  and cary-hiroyuki tagawa .   t . l .  lankford and b . j .  goldman supply the script ,  based on a story by lankford and veteran b director fred olen ray .  it's the kind of script where you just know the writers have their tongues in their cheeks :  they know their material is absurd and cheesy ,  and just have fun throwing credibility out the window .  veteran action director steve carver keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of gunfire ,  explosions ,  and general all-out mayhem .    " bulletproof "  is good fun for the action fan who doesn't mind switching off their brain now and then and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor .   7/10
guns blasting ,  buildings exploding ,  cars crashing ,  and that's just the first ten minutes .    this action-packed film involving a rogue ex-cia mercenary who can't seem to die no matter how many times he's shot  ( hence the title )  is pretty decent .    tough and toothy gary busey ,  usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks ,  has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued :  after all he's carrying the entire show .  which doesn't mean there isn't a lot of terrific supporting roles including william smith ,  luke askew ,  mills watson ,  r . g .  armstrong ,  henry silva ,  lincoln kirkpatrick ,  thalmus rasulala ,  and several other  " forgotten "  character-actors .    there's enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story :  busey has to free a group of  " kidnapped "  american military elites and return a high-tech  " supertank "   ( a normal tank with a cheesy add-on pasted to the top )  back to the states .    but does america deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys ?  this question is asked ,  of course ,  like in any film centering on the cia .  .  .  but without getting preachy . 
this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage .  straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks ,  shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it can't help but amuse and entertain .  there are tanks ,  helicopters ,  machine gun battles ,  grenades and ice cream vans and if they aren't good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one .  .  . danny trejo .  and if you don't know who danny trejo is then you probably won't like this film . 
i caught this film late on a sat night/ sunday morning with my brother .  we had been drinking .  this is one of the best films for ripping apart i have ever seen .  from the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on ,  roll off' ferry ,  complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff ,  then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film rocks !  !  the continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it ,  it slaps you in the face with the holes .  in the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance .  cut to his son and new girlfriend  ( the ships pr director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true ) on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion .   .  .  .  .  .  . then the dad is there hugging them .  how ?  ?  ?  ?  who cares ,  its magic .  there is not one redeeming feature to this film .  the casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table .  when being chased by the villains there is only one place to hide ,  you've guessed it .  enter the villains who ,  instead of checking under the one table ,  proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar  ( a corner bar in the casino - fantastic )  .  they walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our casper to get around them and 'take them out' .   get some mates over ,  get a few drinks in ,  put this film on and howl . 
i truly enjoyed the movie ,  however ,  i did not realize that little richard had so many things going on in his life .  first of all i was not aware of lucille .  there is very little  ( hardly any )  mention of females being intimately involved with little richard .  even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a romantic way .  i wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned .  overall the movie was great .  i also did not like leon playing the part of little richard ,  he is a good actor but i feel that the part of should have went to a different actor .  visually he did not remind me of little richard .  i also was totally unaware of the promiscuity that little richard was a part of .  from the movie he was pictured as a sexual addict .  in todays time he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition .  he was a voyeur .  i don't want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen the movie however there were several things about the movie that i feel should not have been a part of the final cut . 
actually they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray little richard than leon .  he captures little richard to a most believable essence .  the outfits where wonderful and any person watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie .  although the movie is a little long ,  it keeps your attention with the personality and outfits of little richard in mind .  the ending should have taken a direction of moving little richard more into the present where you could see him as he has aged into this new millennium .  he will always be the king of rock-n-roll as far as i am concerned regardless of what the other media says . 
tressa's vocal performance was outstanding !  !  tressa played the female singer role ,  while richard was in the club .  when she first step out on stage ,  and started to riff and strut her stuff ,  it made my soul shake .  her voice is platinum .  she needs to make a cd .  she has more fans then she realizes .  i loved her show stopping performance in the five heart beats ,  which she also starred with leon when she was younger .  how can a little girl have a voice so big .  she is truly amazing . good voice good good good good voice voice voice voice excellent voice fantastic voice  ,  back shaking  ,  tear crying  ,  uplifting ,  take you back in the days voice .  tressa if you read this commit ,  please take my advice and start recording a cd .  if not just for the love of singing ,  but for your fans .  i believe you can truly make it .  look at these other one hit single studio singers ,  lol . 
it is fitting on a musical sunday to get your heart a pumping ,  and no one can do that better than little richard .  the man could sing the drawers off the ladies and defined rock and roll .   look to leon to provide a definitive characterization ,  as he has done so with david ruffin in the temptations and jackie wilson in mr .  rock 'n' roll :  the alan freed story .   this was a fascinating biopic as we saw little richard struggle with his father ,  with his church and with himself over just who he was .  he won the battle and there is no one else that has his voice or his style . 
it is always a nice suprise when a film made for tv turns out to be entertaining such as little richard .  this is a very watchable film about the story of rock and roller  , little richard played by an actor called leon who i have never seen before but does an very good job .  as most tv films  ,  this is a little tamer than if made for cinema which is a shame because i am sure there is lot we could have seen about little richard that was controversial .  instead we see a lot religous rubbish which is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually spoilt a very promising career .  all in all this film is good and the acting is above average fot a tv film .  7 out of 10 . 
leon was fantastic as always ,  this time playing little richard in his early years .  the movie showed a fully fleshed out little richard without neglecting to fill the show with lots of great music .  my only complaint is that the ending was a little abrupt - i was hoping for a 2-parter ! 
a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on  " the real mccoys "  tv series .  i said then and repeat now it was a charming ,  funny ,  and entertaining show ,  well-acted with wonderful characterizations .   i recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna ,  kathy nolan ,  and tony martinez .  as another writer here mentioned ,  it is curious that lydia reed  ( hassie )  and michael winkelman  ( little luke )  weren't refered to ,  but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftra .   the reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show .  one piece of inside information we did not get was whether or not kathy nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute ,  which left luke a  " widow "  in it's last year ,  which wasn't very good .  nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called  " broadside "  ,  about women nurses in the pacific in ww ii .  get it ?  broadside ?  no ,  not funny .   unlike the sleazy ,  salacious ,  and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our values ,   " the real mccoys "  entertained with decent values and fine human beings .  and i thank all involved ,  including the creator ,  irving pinkus ,  for having brought it to my family .  we never missed it . 
i really liked this movie ,  it was good ,  and the actors were brilliant !  leon robinson ,  who played richard ,  and many other classic singers ,  is very good at his job ,  when you see him in a musical movie ,  you know that it is going to be good !  i would suggest that people watch this heart warming ,  sad ,  and special movie ,  if they want to know more about richard !  outstanding !  fresh ! 
the life and time of little richard ,  as told by little richard ,  as produced and directed by little richard ,  was about as one sided as one of his songs .  this is not a biography or even a docudrama ,  but does have good writing ,  great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing richard .  all the music is by little richard ,  so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song .   the movie covers his early childhood ,  carrys thru the formative years in music ,  the wild success and richard's throwing it all away to praise the lord .  its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that little richard discovered the beatles ,  whom opened for him .   my main objection is that his outrageous ,  counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time .  some of his energy ,  which he still has ,  does not come across full force .  he seemed tame ,  compared to what i remember of him at the time .   the best scenes are richard getting jilted by lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing ,  to make the point about not having a decent place to change .   if they had gotten into the  " bronze liberace "  as richard use to refer to himself in interviews ,  then there's a story .  trust me i just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys ,  giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience ,  his headband .  nearly 68 and still going strong i recommend this movie and any concert or t . v .  appearance you can find .  little richard is always on
first of all ,  i think the below comment is unworthy for a site like this .  obviously you have no taste and you don't respect the taste of others .  not to give you a history lesson but i think it needs to be done .  black actors out there are just ,  if not more ,  successful as others .  if you are not a part of the  " black "  race you cannot understand the quality ,  creativeness ,  and vibrant of old movies such as  " sparkle "  and  " mahogany "  and  " cooley high .  "  since unfortunately you are not black ,  you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we watch these classics ,  so therefore you need to keep your freaking mouth shut and just stick to your non-dancing race .  thanks . 
the movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group .  in their endeavors ,  the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called satin ,  whom sister goes after because she believes he is the  " big time "  who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life .  though he could be accused of killing her ,  he really kills only her spirit and will to live ,  after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose .  the story isn't about the street life or the italian mobster who tries to buy stix off ,  then threatens him ,  it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be  " discovered "  back then . 
standard rise to fame tale that has a few high points .  number one ,  lonette mckee as sister who gives a stunning ,  star making performance .  the fact that she never became a huge sensation after this is beyond me .  sadly ,  she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on irena carter's bland character ,  sparkle ,  whose rise to fame is easy ,  boring ,  and unconvincing .  however ,  whenever the girls go on stage and perform ,  the movie comes back to life .  the original music by curis mayfield must be praised .  the copy i saw was a very old vhs tape .  the picture quality was pretty low ,  as well as the production values i'm guessing .  all in all ,  its worth a gander . 
i watched this movie every chance i got ,  back in the seventies when it came out on cable .  it was my introduction to harlem ,  which has fascinated me  ( and bill clinton )  ever since .  i was still very young ,  and the movie made a big impression on me .  it was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up ,  trying to decide whom they wanted to be ,  and making some bad choices as well as good ones .  i was dazzled by lonette mckee's beauty ,  the great dresses they eventually got to wear ,  and the snappy dialogue .  as someone being raised by a single mother as well ,  i could really identify with these girls and their lives .  it's funny ,  these characters seem almost more real to me than beyonce knowles ! 
a remarkable example of cinematic alchemy at work ,  with a trite'n'turgid lump of lead script  ( penned by numbingly mediocre hollywood hack nonpareil jole schumacher ,  no less )  being magically converted into a choice chunk of exquisitely gleaming 24-carat musical drama gold thanks to brisk direction ,  fresh ,  engaging performances ,  spot-on production values ,  a flavorsome recreation of 50's era new york ,  an infectiously effervescent roll-with-the-punches tone ,  and a truly wondrous rhythm and blues score by the great curtis mayfield .   the story ,  loosely based on the real life exploits of the supremes ,  prosaically documents the arduous rags-to-riches climb of three bright-eyed ,  impoverished black teenage girl singers who desperately yearn to escape their ratty ,  unrewarding ghetto plight and make it big in the razzle-dazzle world of commercial r&b music .  all the obvious pratfalls of instant wealth and success -- egos run destructively amok ,  drugs ,  corruption ,  fighting to retain your integrity ,  and so on -- are predictably paraded forth ,  but luckily the uniformly excellent work evident in the film's other departments almost completely cancels out schumacher's flat ,  uninspired plotting .  the first-rate acting helps out a lot .  irene cara ,  lonette mckee ,  and dwan smith are sensationally sexy ,  vibrant and appealing leads -- and great singers to boot .  comparably fine performances are also turned in by a charmingly boyish pre- " miami vice "  philip michael thomas as the group's patient ,  gentlemanly manager ,  dorian harewood as mckee's venal ,  aggressively amorous hound dog boyfriend ,  and perennial blaxploitation baddie tony  (  " hell up in harlem ,  "   " bucktown "  )  king as a dangerously seductive ,  smooth operating ,  stone cold nasty gangster .  the tone dips and dovetails from funny and poignant to melancholy and blithesome without ever skipping a beat ,  deftly evolving into a glowing ,  uplifting ode to the human spirit's extraordinary ability to effectively surmount extremely difficult and intimidating odds .   veteran editor sam o'stern acquits himself superbly in his directorial debut .  bruce surtees' luminescent cinematography and gordon scott's expert editing are both flawless .  o'stern's firm grasp of period atmosphere ,  keen eye for tiny ,  but telling little details ,  and unerring sense of busy ,  unbroken pace are just as impressive .  no fooling about curtis mayfield's impeccable soundtrack contributions ,  either .   " jump ,  "   " what can i do with this feeling ,  "   " givin' up ,  "   " take my hand precious lord ,  "   " lovin' you baby ,  "  and  " look into your heart "  are all terrifically tuneful ,  soulful ,  almost unbelievably fantastic songs ,  with the sweetly sultry love jones number  " something he can feel ,  "  which was later covered by both aretha franklin and en vogue ,  clearly copping top musical honors as the best-ever song in the entire movie .  the net result of all these above cited outstanding attributes persuasively illustrates that sometimes it's not the screenplay so much as what's done with said script which in turn determines a film's overall sterling quality . 
an excellent movie .  superb acting by mary alice ,  phillip m .  thomas ,  and a young irene cara .  tony king was very realistic in his role of satin .  this movie was one of the last predominately  " all black "  movies of the 70's and unlike the  " blaxploitation "  movies of that era ,  this movie actually had a plot ,  and was very well done .  the movie soundtrack ,  sung by aretha franklin ,  was popular on the r&b charts at the time . 
i was 5 years old when i saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in st .  thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it .  27 years later ,  it is still an original inspiration for achieveing my goals that i have set to accomplish since that time !   this tragic story of a hard-core  " behind the scenes "  of the entertainment industry during the late 50's ,   " sparkle "  successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun .  this story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand .   the phenomenal music written and composed by aretha franklin and curtis mayfield ,  the soundtrack carries the plot with every song .  from being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long-term decision-making ,  to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead ,  all three young girls ,  sparkle ,  sister ,  and delores ,  represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society .   this movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating  " dreamgirls "  on broadway ,  and mariah carey's  " glitter ,  "  25 years later .  as an original audience member of both productions ,  i have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to  " sparkle ,  "  as well as in  " saturday night fever ,  "   " fame ,  "   " flashdance ,  "  and the off-broadway smash hit  " mama ,  i want to sing .  " 
i saw this movie while it was under limited release ,  mainly for the novelty of seeing pierce brosnan with a moustache ,  but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies i have seen all year .  it starts out almost as a thriller ,  but steadily progresses into a hilarious piece of work full of one-liners and great comedic energy between pierce brosnan and greg kinnear .  also ,  while i say this movie is a comedy ,  it doesn't forget it has a heart at times and can be very touching when it needs to be .  when i went into the theater i didn't know what to expect much more than a moustache ,  but what i got was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time .  leaving the theater i felt very fulfilled from the film and plan to see it again in wide release .  i recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and a big moustache . 
farrah fawcett has spent the better part of her post-angel's career confounding us ,  with an occasional noteworthy acting performance sandwiched in between her playboy frolics and letterman escapades .  but when it comes down to it ,  there's no denying that this girl can act .  far from a story of epic proportions ,  this well-done tv-movie is gentle ,  quiet and occasionally moving .  fawcett plays the wayward black sheep daughter come home only to find that she missed the last days of her mom's life as well as the funeral ,  much to the chagrin of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister .  brad johnson plays the love interest ,  and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of telefilm drama- but then there's always that confounding farrah to watch ,  and she does ,  indeed ,  remain eminently watchable .   ( and ,  yes ,  i admit it ,  i did have that farrah poster on my wall way back when )  .  silk hope gets three and a half stars  ( out of five )  on the corkymeter .  bosley would be proud . 
this is a pleasant film ,  even if the premise is silly .  it was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch .  meg ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film  ( another example is joe vs .  the volcano )  .  that's what makes her a star ,  in part .  walter matthau ,  of course ,  had that ability ,  too ,  and he really puts himself into the role ,  making an amusing ,  good-hearted einstein .  i suppose you could say they're both good at portraying loveable characters ,  though loveable in different ways  ( loveable young women vs .  loveable curmudgeon )  . 
iq is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors that seem to click well on screen .  plot is a typical guy wrong for girl ,  guy gets girl format ,  but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not the the mind .  addition of albert einstein and his band of geniuses provides excellent comic relief .  overall ,  a good movie .  not great ,  but good
 " a little nonsense now and then ,  is cherished by the wisest men .  "   if you are too smart to watch this movie ,  then you are too smart to be alive .    wonderful romp ,  wonderful premise ,  period piece done with acute eye for detail .   walter matthau ,  meg ryan ,  tim robbins - et al - just wonderful !   rent it ,  sit down ,  relax ,  take it in ,  smile a little .  enjoy yourself .    then ,  thank me . 
this is a romantic comedy where albert einstein ,  played wonderfully by walter matthau ,  and his cronies play match maker to his niece  ( meg ryan )  and a talented auto mechanic  ( tim robbins )  .  the interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors .  this movie is cute and fun  .  .  .  a  " feel-gooder "  !  hearty recommendations . 
i loved the idea of this film from the moment i first saw a trailer for it .  einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly ,  playful ,  slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film .  the added spice of matthau as einstein made it even better .   the story is pure fantasy ,  but a delightful one .  an auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman ,  who happens to be einstein's niece .  with the help of four fairy godfathers of physics ,  ed embarks on a quest to win catherine's heart .  throw a jealous fiancé  ( who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology )  and eisenhower into the mix ,  and you have pure fun .   the film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances .  walter matthau play einstein as a mischievous imp ;  cupid with a slide rule .  tim robbins is wonderfully endearing as ed and meg ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level .  stephen fry is a joy as the  " rrratman "  and ryan's fiancé ;  who lacks a single romantic bone in his body .   the film fell below most radars ,  but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings .  it features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world . 
while fred schepisi's  " i . q .  "  doesn't really have any important qualities ,  it's still worth seeing .  walter matthau plays albert einstein ,  trying to help mechanic ed walters  ( tim robbins )  fall in love with princeton mathematics doctoral candidate catherine boyd  ( meg ryan )  .  probably the funniest scene is when dr .  frizzyhead and friends  ( lou jacobi ,  gene saks and joseph maher )  try to make ed look like a scientist :  he ends up looking like a french impressionist .   obviously little of the movie is historically accurate ,  but that's not the point .  it's not intended as anything except a light comedy ,  quite the opposite of robbins's most famous movie from 1994  ( the shawshank redemption )  .  a movie about einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements ,  but also his political activism ,  namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the scottsboro nine and came out against nuclear weapons  ( it got to the point where the fbi kept a file on him )  .   so anyway ,  this one is acceptable .  also starring stephen fry ,  tony shalhoub ,  frank whaley ,  charles durning and keene curtis . 
this was a great romantic comedy !  historically inaccurate  ( einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in imdb )  but he made a great matchmaker .  he brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working .  the supporting cast  ( lou jacobi ,  joseph maher ,  gene saks ,  stephen fry ,  etc .  )  all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience .  the fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around .  and did he wear socks in one scene .  .  . reportedly ,  the professor never wore socks !   ( two new entries for the imdb goofs section .  )  historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside ,  this was a great movie to watch with a great cast .  i give it an 8 ! 
this movie had me smiling from beginning to end ,  partly at the humor ,  partly at meg ryan  ( this is the perfect character for her )  ,  and always because it's just one of the best feel-good movies i've seen .  hopefully the dvd will be out soon . 
interesting how much more realistic brosnan's performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films .  he's neurotic ,  paranoid ,  an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot .  this is perfect break for him ,  even so much as to make fun of the bond icon .   " i'm a mess ,  a parody of myself "  he says .  it doesn't get any better than that .  i just finished reading dr . no and this is very much how ian fleming had portrayed james bond .  personally i never liked brosnan as bond because he fit the icon too closely .  there was nothing for him to personalize the character with ,  as compared to roger moore or sean connery .  its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall .  a shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with .  it's an impressive portrayal ,  and having greg kinear to ground him ,  is just poetic .  this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in  " my blue heaven "  ,  but more genuine in their coping mechanisms . 
a solid ,  if unremarkable film .  matthau ,  as einstein ,  was wonderful .  my favorite part ,  and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again ,  was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton ,  i loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for robbins to retrieve the birdie . 
what a delightful romp  a very competently made film that has so much charm and a feelgood factor that a lot of romantic comedies lack .  einstein is brilliantly acted by walter matthau ,  while meg ryan's catherine is unforgettable  better than i have seen her in those films opposite tom hanks  as the young mathematician struggling to be recognized .   you don't need to be a young woman to understand catherine's struggle and feel sympathetic for her immediately ,  and as a young man it's easy to understand what must have gone through ed's  ( tim robbins )  mind in pursuing his true love .  there's universal appeal in these emotions ,  even if i . q .  keeps it all light ,  fun and tied up nicely .   sure it's not heavy ,  but if you look there are some subtexts .  people remember albert einstein as a scientist yet he was a great spiritualist ;  his sayings such as something along the lines of ,  'if it is not impossible ,  then why do it ? ' suggest he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals beyond one's immediate grasp .  in this film ,  there are questions of what an accident really is  such as whether albert and his whacky sidekicks' intervention in prying catherine away from stiff-upper-lip ,  loveless james  ( stephen fry  who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you cannot help but feel for his lack of feeling )  counts .  how much intervention happens in our lives that we do not see ,  and comes across as serendipitous ?   and of course ,  we'd like to think in real life ,  despite what we often observe of the people we know ,  that we edwards get the catherines and jameses have to learn how to defrost the icewater in their veins .  how nice to know that it might work out in i . q . 's innocent  ( and disturbingly ,  exclusively caucasian )  eisenhower-era land of make-believe . 
this movie is a very relaxed ,  romantic-comedy ,  which is thoroughly enjoyable .  meg ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of albert einstein ,  though she does believe in her own skills .  tim robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancé after her car stuffs up .  i loved walter matthau as the one and only albert einstein .  this movie just has a very relaxing feel to it ,  while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it  ( if that is actually possible ,  it happens here )  .   i personally found this movie extremely entertaining ,  especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious !  this movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension .  if you have a cheeky sense of humour ,  this is the movie for you ! 
the part where meg visits the mechanic and he says -  " is the piston firing short ?  "   ( implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée )  was hilarious .  i love meg ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie .  very lovable and very intelligent too .  her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours .  the hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well .  einstein had a romantic side to his psyche ?  the puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well .  it's awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival .  it loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the us govt .  i don't see why it doesn't figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century .  great movie ,  it has the presidential seal of approval on it ! 
iq is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest-thinking scientific minds of the 20th century as cupid's helpers .  the juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light-hearted yet thoughtful movie .  you don't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love ,  but at other times ,  you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space/time of our age .  the end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout .  walter matthau is a perfect einstein ,  meg ryan creates a quirky ,  scatter-brained mathematician ,  and tim robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science .  all together ,  they create a farcical trip through love and science ,  mind and heart . 
it was a doubly interesting experience .  for some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th century had never been the central figure in a movie* .  the closest i can think of as films with einstein in them are champaign for caesar ,  where  ( like a  " deus ex ma-china "  )  the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show ,  so that ronald colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all ,  and in bullshot where the great albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain ,  intent on stealing some machines of theirs .  it is notable that in those two cases ,  and in iq ,  we are dealing with comedies .  so far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of einstein ,  like john huston's attempt to do one on freud with montgomery cliff .  i guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro-magnetic field theory into exciting dialog .  but then ,  only three years ago russell crowe and christopher plummer did a beautiful mind .  maybe nobody really has tried .    ( *subsequently ,  after writing this ,  i remembered the successful comedy young einstein with yahoo serious about ten years ago .  but that is an exception and it was a spoof .  )   the other surprise was the actor playing the great albert .  it was walter matthau ,  here taking time away from the series of films he did with jack lemmon in that last decade of their careers .  matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor ,  in both comedy and drama ,  but normally his comic personas were variants of his  " whiplash willie "  gingrich from the fortune cookie .  they were connivers and gonifs .  later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them ,  but they remained grumpy types .  but his albert einstein happens to be genuinely sweet .  more like his kotch than like willie clarke .   he plays albert as good old uncle albert .  it seems that matthau's einstein is living in princeton with his niece catherine boyd  ( meg ryan )  ,  and she is seeing a stuffy professor named james morland  ( stephen fry )  .  but fry's car needs repairs ,  and they take it to the auto shop where ed walters  ( tim robbins )  works .  robbins falls for ryan ,  who is attracted to him - but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires .  good old uncle albert ,  aided by his three friends  ( lou jacobi ,  joseph maher ,  and gene saks )  decide to give their assistance to robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius .  this will open the doors of romance between him and ryan ,  provided ryan is impressed and fry does not spoil things  ( as he hopes to do )  .   the atmosphere is sweet ,  as when matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help robbins cheat on  ( by switching the positions of their bodies )  .  the plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship - which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of president eisenhower  ( keene curtis )  .   it was a charming comedy ,  and an interesting stretch for matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal ,  but far more subdued . 
while the sparkling chemistry between ryan and robbins alone is reason enough to see this movie ,  the supporting cast  ( including matthau ,  fry ,  shalub ,  durning and the hilarious trio of jacobi ,  saks and maher )  is an additional plus .  matthau shines as einstein ,  fry is perfect as ryan's clinical fiancé ,  and shalub's line about einstein's gonads is ,  as has been noted ,  one of the highlights of the film .  the speech that robbins delivers at his first appearance in public is sheer poetry .  kudos to the writers for handling this froth with wit and levity .  i also thought that keene curtis was wonderful as eisenhower .  this might be considered something of a chick movie ,  but i think everyone will get a kick out of it .  eight very solid points . 
this film tells the story of a romance between albert einstien niece and a gas station attendant .  in order to get the two together ,  einstien agrees to help ed ( hudsucker proxy's tim robbins )  learn to act more intelligent .  this impresses catherine  ( meg ryan )  .  unfortunately einstien goes too far and ed is considered to be a genius .  hilarity ensues .  not to be missed .  filmed in mercer county new jersey at princeton university ,  lawrenceville prep school  ( doubling for princeton university )  as well as a beautiful vintage gas station in hopewell . 
being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre ,  and therefore having seen a large number of these films ,  it is rare that one strikes me as totally unique .  for that matter ,  it is equally rare that i am gasping for breath through the laughter during several scenes .  the love story is a little thin on the ground ,  but i'd say that's probably for the best ,  as this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on  " comedy "  ,  and in any case it stretches the bounds of credibility just a little more than i like most rom com's to do .  the four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this film ,  but in any film i've seen in a long while .  i hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a  " 10 "  over a  " 9 "  as a rating ,  as i believe that far too many people use it indiscriminately ,  and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact .  i'm also a big meg ryan fan ,  which helps ,  but this is one of the few films i've seen in which i'd say she is comprehensively overshadowed .  she and tim robbins are cast as the leads ,  but for me play second fiddle to the antics of the bumbling intellectuals .  a genuine laugh-out-loud type film . 
this movie is so great .  its set back in probably the 40's and meg ryan's character struggles to be known as 'smart . ' plus tim robbins is so cute in this movie .  and everything about it has a magical feeling towards it .  everytime i watch it i feel happy .  it's definitely a girl movie ,  and i'm a girl ,  so i like it .  i also love the music .  the violin is awesome .  but besides that i think it's a cute story and everyone should watch it . 
first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots .  i really enjoyed them .  i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan ,  greg kinear is pretty lackluster .  brosnan melts into this character so well ,  that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond .  it also shows his range and depth as an actor .  it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year .  i found the characters to be well crafted .  the twist in the middle i felt was especially good .  i also liked how the characters come off realistically .  so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking-stereotypes .  .  .  i like the different approaches this movie takes .  i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall .  .  . 
i . q .  ,  in my opinion ,  is a sweet ,  charming ,  and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you .  if you ask me ,  james  ( stephen fry )  really was a dull guy .  to me ,  ed  ( tim robbins )  was more suited for catherine  ( meg ryan )  than james was .  anyway ,  everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job .  now ,  in conclusion ,  i highly recommend this sweet ,  charming ,  and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any tim robbins or meg ryan fan who hasn't seen it .  you're in for lots of laughter ,  so go to the video store ,  rent it or buy it ,  kick back with a friend ,  and watch it . 
this is a really fun ,  breezy ,  light hearted romantic comedy .  you cannot go wrong with meg ryan's cute perkiness combined with albert einstein's genius .  normally ,  i'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people ,  now deceased and not able to defend themselves ,  but i think the late einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one .   it's the 1950's .  .  . princeton ,  new jersey in the spring .  the story revolves around a pretty ,  young ,  scatter brained mathematician ,  catherine  ( meg ryan )  ,  who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk ,  a behavioral researcher named james ,  merely because he has the brains she's looking for in the father of her future children .  however ,  it's love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named ed  ( tim robbins )  .  as she doesn't think ed is intelligent enough ,  her uncle ,  none other than albert einstein ,  plays match maker ,  assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies ,  all theoretical physicists .  uncle albert must make ed appear suitably smart ,  so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist .  .  . naturally with amusing results .   walter matthau is his usual hilarious self ,  and pulls off the character of einstein quite effectively .  with his three professorial buddies ,  kurt ,  nathan ,  and boris ,  a lot of laughs ensue .  the real einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one  ( outrageous )  step further .  if you suspend all logic ,  you can almost imagine this silly story happening !   it might not be rocket science  ( despite its main character )  but it is a wonderful sweet ,  refreshing movie .  one of the best of the comedy romance genre . 
bottom line - best romantic comedy ever .  this movie accomplishes what all great movies strive for :  the creation of a world and time that we want to re-visit and makes us glad to be part of the human race .  when i am blue ,  this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh  ( and that is still true after many viewings - always fresh )  .   all of the actors are in top form .  the characterizations are so dead on and the characters mesh so well together that you forget the actor  ( usually difficult to do with matthau ,  robbins and ryan )  .  the supporting cast is consistently brilliant :  fry  (  " agae "  ,   " a total pygmy package "  !  )  ,  jacoby & saks & maher  ( the three theoretical physicists as  " greek chorus "  -  " but time doesn't exist "  )  ,  durning  (  " something we can launch from nj "  )  ,  shalhoub & whaley  ( robbins' boss and co-worker at the service station )  ,  and curits  ( eisenhower - how many comedies have eisenhower ?  ?  )  .   don't miss this overlooked treasure . 
fairly good romantic comedy in which i don't think i've ever seen meg looking any cuter .  all the players did a good job at keeping this a lively romp .  of course ,  in the real world no genius mathematician would even glance at some grease monkey ,  but that is why i love romantic comedies .  .  .  . one can just totally forget reality and have a good time .  nice film .  damn ,  meg is a babe ,  eh ? 
australian fred schepisi  ( a cry in the dark )  directs this comedy/ romance that is fun ,  relaxing ,  and set in the spring .  you will laugh while watching this movie .  tim robbins  ( shawshank redemption ,  dead man walking )  is an auto mechanic ,  ed walters ,  with a high iq ,  which gets higher with the help of albert einstein ,  walter matthau  ( grumpy old men )  and his academic friends nathan ,  kurt and boris .  you can tell them by their preppie shoes .  meg ryan  ( sleepless in seattle ,  you've got mail )  is catherine boyd ,  einstein's niece who is a competent ,  but not so confident mathematician .  perhaps it is because she is surrounded by all that genius .  she thinks that if she marries someone with a high i . q .  her kids will have a high i . q .  as well ,  but she does not knows what she wants .  between tim robbins cute smile and meg's cuteness this is a refreshing movie .  i love sweet stories .  people all ages should enjoy this movie .  catherine is engaged to the jerk james moreland ,  who works in animal behavior ,  but is very stuffy .  this is a love a first sight type situation ,  between the mechanic and the mathematician .  witty lines and subliminal lines !  the cinematography is nice .  princeton ,  new jersey is beautiful in the spring .  with much help from all those brilliant men catherine falls for ed ,  without knowing that he is an automobile mechanic .   favorite scenes :  ed taking a multiple choice test in front of a crowd with the help of einstein ,  nathan ,  kurt ,  and boris .  ed and einstein riding on the motorcycle .  nathan ,  kurt and boris letting all the research animals free !   favorite quotes :  albert einstein :   " don't let your brain interfere with your heart "  .  ed walters :   " when was the last time he said  " wahoo "  "  ?  catherine boyd :   " well i'm sure i don't know "  .  this is a refreshing movie ,  i recommend it .  i have the tape and every once and awhile i will watch it again . 
this is one of my all time favorites .  it is so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy .  i really like a film full of good quotes and this has it .  .  .  one of my favorites is when albert einstein says to ed walters  " are you thinking what i'm thinking "  and ed says  " now what are the odds of that happening !  "  in my opinion ,  a film is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it ,  and with this one ,  you can !  !  i also really enjoyed walter m . s way of portraying einstein .  i think all the characters fit together really well and the story flows nicely .  there are so many times that i find myself smiling right along with the film and quoting my favorite lines as i watch it !  i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a feel-good romantic comedy now and then ! 
i recently saw i . q .  and even though i'm not a romantic comedy type of gal ,  i think that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch .  so many movies in my opinion lack honesty .  you know that feeling when you're watching a movie and you just feel robbed because it's taking something from the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash ?  the story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one .  how they stuck together and they tried to help tim robbins character become smart .  i liked the love story between tim and meg because it was simple and brought up a good point when it comes to love ,   " nothing is what it seems "  .  i would recommend this for a sunday morning .   7/10
i just watched i .  q .  again tonight and had forgotten how much i love this movie .  it is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world .  i love the allusions to mozart all throughout from the opening with  " einstein "  playing  " twinkle ,  twinkle little star "  on the violin to him humming eine kleine nachtmusik during the iq testing of the ed walters .  i love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career ,  an especially unique situation for the 1950's ,  the time in which this movie is set .   ( i myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children ,  so please don't think i am some staunch women's libber .  )  it's wonderful how a man who is  " only a grease monkey "  is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as catherine's fiance ,  a clinical behavioral researcher .  the message to me is that we are not what we do ,  but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels .  there are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully .   i did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page .  in the scene when ed walters is to speak at symposium ,  there are 3 instruments  ( protractor ,  ruler ,  etc .  )  hanging on the right from the chalk ledge .  in the next camera shot ,  there only 2 .  in the credits on our video ,  it lists tony shaloub's character as bob watters ,  not bob rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on imdb .   i highly recommend this movie .  it may be a piece of fluff in some estimations ,  but has lots more substance than many give it credit for .  not only that ,  what a great cast is assembled here .  watch it and enjoy ! 
maybe i'm being too generous with the rating .  .  . but i just love this movie !  i've seen it so many times ,  but every time i see it i fall in love with it all over again .  it's just a simple romantic comedy ,  with nothing huge or monumentous that happens .  but i'm a big romantic and this movie *is* romantic .  i love meg ryan and tim robbins ,  and walter mathau is so funny .  the scientists make me laugh so much .  .  . i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it .  it's such a clean ,  good movie - and those are so rare now !  my 20-year-old brother likes this movie ,  too ,  so it's not just a chick-flick .   ; - )  i recommend it if you need to laugh ,  or if you're just lonely and need to *watch* a romance ,  if you yourself can't participate in one .  it's a good 'un ! 
about 1986 i saw this movie by accident on tv one night .  i was 6 years old .  it was similar to my accidental viewing of the terrifying ending to don't look now in 1987 .  i went to venice on holiday the next year in silent terror ,  hoping to god that my parents wouldn't find out i'd watched it !    would i have minded if my parents knew i'd watched les valseuses when i was a kid ?  i'd probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays ,  and my mum's probably disapproving in the afterlife .  i don't know if they'd want to see it anyway .  from the stalking and trapping of a woman at the block of flats in the first scene to sliding down the mountain roads with glazed satiated eyes i'm never sure whether this film is an insensitive piece of trash that disregards the sexual revolution or if it's a sexy liberating movie to watch as it dawns on you that you could never be so offensive yourself .    it's definitely violent .  it has a violent view of sex ,  virtually no acknowledgement of love .  even suckling a young baby mutates into a greedy sexual act of exploitation .  but the scenario is very erotic and  ( god i'm so british )  arousing !  do they suck her breasts for her own good ?  that is exploitation .  so why am i getting a woody ?   the fellows go in search of an experienced older woman ,  find an ex-con ,  mother-figure ?  i don't know .  it ends in a truly gruesome suicide .  i described it to my friend jb nelson ,  who has cannibal holocaust-guts ,  and he went eeuurrgghh !  no motherly love for this movie ,  quite the opposite .  mutilation of where the boys began .  why do they shoot the girl in the leg ?  why does she come back to them ?  do women need to be punished so that they learn what is right from men ?   i'm thinking of two movies ,  one of which i wish i'd never seen ,  the other makes me wish it wasn't such a harsh world .  swept away/madonna what a pile of insanity doesn't compute never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes slave to man and its maybe madonna saying everybody respect guy ritchie im so enraged i cant use punctuation !  once upon a time in america/leone god why does noodles do it ?  destroys the path to joy we've been following him on his whole life .  so close to finally finding love with deborah .  now they are both destroyed .  why sergio ?  why ?   there is no rape in les valseuses but lots of sex and nakedness in abundance ,  of both sexes .  very honest ,  no titillation .  no fantasy shags ,  no perfect hollywood smooth moves .  jokes ,  yes .  but there's too much darkness and jealousy and trickery in here to call it a sex comedy .  forget carry on shooting a naked hairdresser in the leg cos she'll come back & you'll hook her up with your ex-con lover's vengeant son & she'll learn how to cum from him .   two things i can't stand are rape movies and prison movies .  les valseuses isn't a rape movie !  god nobody's going to want to watch it now !  it is a brilliant movie ! 
dark comedy ?  gallows humor ?  how does one make a comedy out of murder ?  it can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people .  so ,  the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work .  so ,  pierce brosnan ,  the irishman's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain-smoking ,  sex-addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis .  he meets a struggling businessman ,  greg kinnear ,  and after a rocky beginning ,  he learns that he needs a friend .  but ,  greg's happily married to hope davis and brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn't have ,  love ,  home and a life .  add character actor ,  philip baker hall as the hit-man's manager and we're off to the races .  brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti-hero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart ,  the very human businessman .  hope davis adds a sparkle as kinnear's very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives .  the ending is delightful and with some surprise to it .  you should leave the theater feeling ,  at least ,  partly good-- if you're able to suspend being aghast at killing people . 
depardieu's most notorious film is this  ( 1974 ) groundbreaker from bertrand blier .  it features many highly sexual scenes verging on an x-rating ,  including one of jeanne moreau doing a hot 1970s version of her jules and jim menage a trois with the two hairy french hippies  ( depardieu and deware )  .  there is no such thing as a sacred territory in this film ;  everything is fair game .   it's very odd that americans tend to not like this film very much while many french people i've met consider it a classic .  something about it goes against what americans have been programmed to 'like . '  gerard and the late patrick deware are two bitch-slapping ,  hippy drifters with many sexual insecurities ,  going around molesting women and committing petty crimes .  they're out for kicks and anti-capitalist ,  euro-commie ,  slacker 'freedom . ' blier satirizes the hell out of these two guys while at the same time making bourgeois society itself look ultimately much more ridiculous .  best of all though ,  is the way the wonderful stephane grappelli score conveys the restless soul of the drifters ,  the deeper subconscious awareness or 'higher ideal' that motivates all the follies they engage in . 
as with that film we follow the implausible if always engaging adventures of the 2 lead characters .  but whilst c + j eschew sex for a girly trip back into childhood ,  this pair revel in their carnality even to the point of exploring homoeroticism .  most of the sex they acquire from grudging or unwilling partners and yet ,  despite their deeply un-pc behaviour ,  everyone emerges smiling .  like c + g ,  through it all they remain innocents at heart ,  rebels against the quotidien ,  the bourgeois ,  the restrictive .  as someone else has commented ,  i wouldn't want to know these 2 and it's a minor miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy  ( and what there is of that cannot be laid at their door )  and thus for that reason ,  it left me beguiled but with a sweet taste in the mouth .  dare i say that only the french can get away with films like this .  and that is part of their genius . 
i remember hitch hiking to spain at 25 ,  getting a lift from ,  what turned out to be ,  two fleeing italian small crooks .  they were doing a lot outside the law ,  but from the other side carrying a little portrait of jesus in the pocket for their protection .  .  . just and unjust ,  good and bad ,  criminal and correct where here in a new combination ,  outside of the categories i used to know .  'les valseuses' gives me ,  although a film and not real life ,  a picture close to my own experiences :  the intenseness of each moment as soon as you leave 'all behind' and go for the momentous ,  whatever comes your way ,  it's another state of mind and also 'dangerous' form of life ,  because ,  as we all know ,  there are people who are not ready for this and willing to persecute you for 'stealing' and so on .  .  . this film touches 'values' ,  it's a story about 'what's right and wrong' :  morals .  it's resurrection of the individual fighting him/ herself free against the 'false morals' and conformism .  .  . there's danger all the way ,  because ,  how far can you go with your own 'freedom' and crossing your own moral borders and that of other people ?  what to do with people who are willing to hurt you ,  put you in jail or even shoot at you for the things that you do ,  like  " stealing "  some petrol from a multinational oil company for you fifth hand car ?  les valseuses re-awakens these questions in me ,  because morality ,  in contradiction to the usual 'media message' ,  is quite complex .  .  . 
this film is a stunning piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewer that gerard depardieu is one of the finest film actors of the last 50 years .  his performance shocks ,  entertains ,  disgusts and charms you while leaving you breathless .  this film was shot in the very early days of his film career and is very raw ,  but still is able to convey the mastery of depardieu .  a must-see for any depardieu fan and by far his best early work . 
i can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978 .  hbo would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence .  back then it was unrated and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay television .  .  . especially back then .  i would love to see it now as an adult where i would be more apt to understand the adult theme of it .  it was probably the closest thing i had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8 .  luckily i had stupid babysitters and party-going parents on the weekends .  most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys .  breaking into houses to sniff underwear ,  feeding on a stranger's breast milk on a public bus ,  and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked escapades these guys were pulling off .  a very racy film for the early '70s .  until i checked imdb ,  i had no idea this movie had such a following .  most people i talk to have never heard of it . 
i originally saw this film years ago during cinemax friday after dark series ( back when the cable box was built like a keyboard )  , and it intrigued me .  even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted . the performances of depardieu & dewaere are very enjoyable . they have a good chemistry together & miou-miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking . a movie like this probably wouldn't be made in these politically correct times ( at least not in the us )  ,  since it seems to sensationalize things like violence , robbery , & casual sex .  this movie proves that with a talented cast & also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject . it saddened me to find out patrick dewaere committed suicide & in the near future i , ll will check him out with depardieu & miou-miou in get out your hankerchief . 
the movie has a distinct  ( albeit brutish and rough )  humanity for all its borderline depravity - the zippy/lyrical score points up the comic side of their misadventures ,  and even when they're at their most thuggish  ( like terrorizing the woman on the train )  ,  a semi-pitiful vulnerability lurks never far away  ( dewaere sucks on her breasts like a baby )  .  blier cuts away from the scene where depardieu may be about to rape dewaere ,  so we're never sure how explicitly to read the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - either way ,  that incident is the start of their relative humanization  ( so the movie could certainly be read as pro-gay ,  although it could likely be read as pro-anything you want )  .  the movie has many objectionable scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the foibles of both sexes ,  making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty ,  and hitting numerous points of possible profundity on the basis that if you fire off enough shots ,  some of them are bound to hit . 
not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not ,  so beware :   just a small but crucial thing to watch for ,  an intriguing possibility :  the boys steal a green citroen at one point ,  for a joy ride ,  and return it to the owner having done purposeful and vengeful hidden damage to the car ,  hoping that the owner will crash .  is it the very same car they steal much later from the picnicking family ?  we know the original owner sold it .  they drive off at the end on a dangerous road ,  one which i understand has been closed to all but pedestrians for the last ten years .  a whole new slant to the end of the film .   on another matter ,  this film could have been called  " scent of a woman "  .  i don't recall another film ,  certainly not american ,  that treats the scent of a woman in such a frank and open manner ,  much like the  " nose "  of a fine bordeaux . 
a wonderful ,  free flowing ,  often lyrical film that whisks you along ,  ever smiling ,  even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way .  one gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well .  this is possibly depardieu's best performance ,  certainly his most natural .  jeanne moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age .  miou-miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play .  initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rant/romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges .  in the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect . 
not so many people like the movies of bertrand blier simply because they don't understand them .  simply because they are different kinds of people .   if you have not been living under a deep desperation intertwined with great personal hope it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor blier shown here .   and also the film of blier cannot be classified easily as black-comedy or cult etc .  like those of pulp fiction etc .  because there is this delicacy which the audience of north-america frequently fail to appreciate .   when i looked at these two `hooligans' dining with jeanne moreau in the seaside restaurant ,  i felt they were more gentil than any gentleman can have been .   the urge to make love wildly like these is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless being-symbolized by the camion suddenly emerges at the carrefour .   so ,  les valseuses is much better a name than going places .  to dance a valse you need to be elegant ,  but going places you don't . 
pierce brosnan the newest but no longer james bond ,  is an assassin .  he is very very good at what he does ,  but he's getting old and tired .  greg kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man .  now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives .  then one night they are having drinks in a bar ,  and they begin to talk .  then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events .  the story is excellent ,  the acting is top notch ,  and the humor is hilarious i never thought that pierce brosnan would be this funny ,  but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see . 
bertrand blier is indeed l'enfant terrible of french cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public .  filmed with his fave duo  ( depardieu and dewaere )  and the usual dose of sex  ( miou-miou plays her typical role ,  at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best french actress ever )  .  in first  " les valseuses "  is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals .  those who only are satisfied with family life ,  or simply know nothing more ,  the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that ,  it just let you think of all the usual things in life  ( working for the car ,  being bounded at work etc .  )  .  it's a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we're living in .  great job and it just makes you wish two things  :  dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course depardieu ,  he'd better should have stuck with french movies as he proves here that no one can beat him .  timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some .  .  . 
this is one a most famous movies of the french sexual empowerment of the seventies ,  starring gerard depardieu and patrick dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles .  it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties ,  such as  " serie noire "  ,   " buffet froid "  ,   " beau pere "  ,  all realized by blier .   however ,  i would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie :  the translated title in english is very far from the french version .  it is true that both protagonists are  " going places "  ,  but the title in french could be literally translated by  " the waltz dancers "  ,  which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles .  .  . 
i had mixed feelings for  " les valseuses "   ( 1974 )  written and directed by bertrand blier when i started watching it but i ended up liking it .  i would not call it vulgar  (  " dumb and dumber "  is vulgar ,   " the sweetest thing "  is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid )  ;  i would call it shocking and offensive .  i can understand why many viewers ,  especially ,  the females would not like or even hate it .  it is the epitome of misogyny  ( or so it seems )  ,  and the way two antiheroes treat every woman they'd meet seems unspeakable .  but the more i think of it the more i realize that it somehow comes off as a delightful little gem .  i am fascinated how blier was able to get away with it .  the movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable :  it is well written ,  the acting by all is first - class ,  and the music is sweet and melancholic .  actually ,  when i think of it ,  two buddies had done something good to the women they came across to :  they prepared a woman in the train  ( the lovely ,  docile blonde brigitte fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debuts in rené clément's  " forbidden games "  ( 1952 )  at age 6 )  for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months ;  they found a man who was finally able to get a frigid marie-ange  ( miou-miou )  exited and satisfied ;  they enlightened and educated young and very willing isabelle huppert  ( in one of her early screen appearances .  )  their encounter with jeanne moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level .  in short ,  i am not sure i'd like to meet gérard depardieu's jean-claude and patrick dewaere's pierrot in real life and invite them over for dinner but i had a good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew - it was never boring . 
updated version of a story that had been turned into the film in 1938 england ( return of the frog )  concerning the pursuit by the police of a master criminal known as the frog because of the frog like get up  ( bulging eyes etc )  he wears .   one of the good wallace films from the 1960's it's a solid little entertainment .  clearly influenced by  (  or did this influence )  the restart of the dr mabuse films ,  the frog seems to be more a super villain than a master thief .  while not the best of the wallace films ,  it is worth a look .  it would make an interesting double feature with the excellent earlier film .   between 6 and 7 out of 10 . 
this is one of the better classic edgar wallace movies from the german series - it features all basics for a highly enjoyable wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies :  although his majesty ,  mr .  kinski ,  is missing you still have young joachim 'blacky' fuchsberger ,  starring once again as the typical clever american 'womanizer' ,  you have young eddi arendt in his best  ( and just as well typical )  role ever - the cool ,  sophisticated british butler - and you have  ( not so young anymore )  lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic  ( and thus :  highly entertaining )  police investigator .  furthermore you'll get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask  ( hence the movie's title !  )  ,  you'll get a crazed-out swinging soundtrack ,  classic b-movie action scenes ,  partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives  ( please remind the time of its origin !  )  ,  yelling scream queens ,  and on and on .  .  .  all those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin' cocktail of pure german edgar wallace campyness - highly recommended !  ! 
robot jox doesn't suffer from story or bad effects .  i mean ,  this was 1990 if you know what i'm talking about .  robocop 2 still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the '80s .  if you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period ,  most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time .  it wasn't until terminator 2 :  judgment day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized ,  and story boarders began to use that motive .  but you'll have fond memories of transformers ,  gundam wing ,  even power rangers ,  if you watch this film .  the enemy robot is very menacing .  it makes you not want to face the man without a really good back-up plan .  and there are some great moments within this film .  a traitor/spy is working within their midsts .  who you think is on your side ,  backing you up all the way ,  could be the person you didn't expect him/her to be .  and that's very troublesome to think so ,  don't you agree ? 
yep ,  you read that right ,  kids .  michael bay should've studied this film before making either of his over hyped ,  overlong ,  overly pointless  " transformers "  movies .   " robot jox "  is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the  " transformers "  crew spent on megan fox's personal trainer .   thankfully ,  this little robotic gem ,  initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted charles and albert band's empire pictures studio ,  seems to have developed a cult following over the years .  i fondly remember watching it on vhs during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the cold war-era politics/stereotypes were already out of date by that time  ( just the bands' luck that communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released ,  eh ?  )  ,  it's still a pretty damn cool little b-movie .  they really don't make'em like this anymore ,  or if they do ,  they go the bay route and cgi things to unbearable proportions .   for those who are unfamiliar ,  here's the robo-scoop :  we're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust ,  large scale  " wars "  have been outlawed .  disputes between nations are now settled mano-a-mano  ( or perhaps that should be machine-o-machine-o )  by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized shogun warrior style robots .  whichever 'bot walks away from the fight wins for  " his "  side .  gary graham  ( who would later go on to play detective sykes in the  " alien nation "  tv series )  ,  plays  " achilles ,  "  the greatest robot jock in marketplace  ( a . k . a .  the good guys )  history .  achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine robot bouts  ( ten being the maximum number of battles before a  " jock "  is retired )  and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the  " confederation "   ( i . e .  the russkies !  )  ,  the psychotic alexander  ( who is the most over the top  " evil russian "  stereotype bad guy since dolph lundgren's infamous turn as ivan drago in  " rocky iv "  )  .  the match is called a draw when alexander violates the rules with an illegal robot move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing achilles ,  but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain .  a rematch is scheduled to complete the bout ,  but achilles simply wants to bow out ,  hang up his helmet and move on with his life .  rather than violate the spoiler rules by revealing much more ,  i will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns ,  behind the scenes skullduggery ,  and other difficulties for achilles and his fellow  " jox "  before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale .   i hope i'm not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction ,  because it isn't .   " robot jox "  is just plain fun .  i'll grant that it is a bit higher-concept than your average b-grade sci-fi movie ,  and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known  ( especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green-screen trickery )  ,  it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the empire/full moon pictures factory .  the robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion/model techniques ,  and the sets and costumes don't look half-assed in the slightest .  empire pictures and director stuart  (  " re-animator "  )  gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture .  unfortunately it didn't quite pan out for them  ( or the studio )  but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal .  bottom line :  if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2+ hours ,  feel free to rent a  " transformers "  movie .  by the end you're likely to feel like you've spent all that time watching someone else play a video game .  if you want to have a rock'em ,  sock'em robot good time ,  pick up robot jox instead . 
from the start i knew i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life .  the idea of two giant robots ,  manned by brilliant humans ,  fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot i have ever experienced .  i can't even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script .  let's just just say it compares to both lord of rings pictures  ,  combined .  the academy had a grave oversight in not celebrating the joy that is .  .  .  .  . robot jox . 
after seeing this excellent film over 100 times ,  i still find new things that blow me away with this movie ,  great special effects ,  incredible acting ,  and a plot full of ingenious twists makes this movie an excellent depiction of capitalism versus communism ,  and in this ending everyone is happy and all is well .  best movie ever !  !  ! 
the one of the most remarkable sci-fi movies of the millennium .  not only a movie but an incredible future vision ,  this movie establishes a new standard of s/f movies .  hail and kill ! 
this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year ,  a few too many coincidences and plot holes .  however we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn't come as too much of a surprise .  brosnan is excellent in this role ,  gone is the wooden james bond  ( a role he was wasted in )  .  if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies .  greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnan's straight man .  i've read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within .  there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing .  my father  ( a consultant )  nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a  " facilitator "  .  much like  " grosse pointe blank "  ,  another hit-man comedy ,  the humour can be very dark .  if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself . 
hrm-i think that line was from the old movie posters .   this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator .  here's a tip :  any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading  " in the future .  .  .  "  is going to be fun .  this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you .   in this case ,   " in the future .  .  .  "  means that ,  instead of fighting wars ,  nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine ,  well ,  that's never terribly clear ,  but it's probably something really important .  there are good guys  ( obviously capitalists ,  i . e .   " us "  )  and bad guys  ( commies !  )  and there are big stop-motion robots .   sadly ,  the effects budget was pretty slim ,  so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots .  there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes ,  and then a big space fight near the end .  the space fight is especially nice ,  as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget .   with said money now spent ,  the climactic fight degenerates into  ( and i'm not making this up )  two guys hitting each other with sticks .  i can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene ,  complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads .   like i said-it's dumb .  that's why i bought the tape . 
the scenes are fast-paced .  the characters are great .  i love anne-marie johnson's acting .  i really like the ending .    however ,  i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into achilles's and athena's relationship .  it only blossomed when they kissed each other .

what a master piece .  to take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future .  this film is satire of the highest order .  in my humble opinion it outranks dr .  strangelove .   the clever naming of the two superpowers ,  as the confederation and the market .  cons being commies and market ,  the west !  outstanding .  the clever use of gen joxs ,  was ahead of its time .  only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering .  robot joxs tackled the issue head on in 1989 .   the message of this film is about the comradeship of the humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of government .  this movies screams don't do it you fools you'll kill us all .   excellent 10/10
note to previous reviewer :  this movie is  " science-fiction adaptation of the iliad "  according to the screenwriter .  so whether the references are painful or not ,  no apologies ,  it is the basis for the film .  they admit they stole .  .  . though adapted is the p . c .  term .   great flick but too short .  probably didn't come out as well as the author ,  director ,  or studio wanted ,  but pretty damn fun .  the fact that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its legacy .   a big-budget remake wouldn't be as fun ,  and probably wouldn't do the screenplay any more justice .  but it's fun to dream about the potential there .  a dvd release with some meager extras is apparently available but i don't think it would play on ntsc players .  i'm no expert and thus still trying to figure this out .  for now ,  i live with the vhs incarnation . 
ok ,  this movie was cool .  i don't think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun .  my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while ,  and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard ,  blow off the dust and pop it in .  enjoyable all the way until the end ,  but a great concept .  this is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy .  judgment is victory for robot jox . 
  robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age .  you have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you cant moan to much about the bad parts .  so just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it . 
one of the best movies out there .  yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the greatest ,  but an excellent plot and concept .  great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas .  something different from the usual movies and great fun .  one of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies .  post world war 3 and fighting in gigantic robots ,  the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while .  the sets are not amazing ,  but simple and worked for the overall look of the film .  this movie is very hard to find on dvd ,  but also on vhs .  check it out cause i have loved it since it came out .  not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen .  take a look and think like a child .  it's a great view and very fun . 
my girlfriend and i have a thing for robots .  so i try to seek out movies that have robots .  and this movie has robots .  big ones .  they beat the clang and bang out of each other ,  with the fate of nations hanging in the balance .  it's really cool .  you have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget .  it is very hard to dislike this movie .  because of those big robots .  they looked like transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers !  it made my girlfriend smile .  and that is good enough for me .  and special mention must be made of veteran character actor paul koslo :  as the maniacal russian villain ,  whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste  " like blood "   ( a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-bela lugosi accent )  he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on-screen .  this is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation . 
 " the matador "  is a dark comedy starring pierce brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight-arrow ,  happily-married american businessman  ( greg kinnear )  in mexico .  although the sardonic julian  ( ironically surnamed  " noble "  )  appears to be a  " tough guy "  on the surface ,  underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities ,  a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless .  thus on his birthday ,  he reaches out to danny ,  a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by julian's  " unconventional "  lifestyle .  in fact ,  both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter ,  franker moments of self-evaluation .   although the film is a bit too reminiscent of  " analyze this "  and  " midnight run "  to feel entirely fresh and original ,   " the matador ,  "  nevertheless ,  earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting .  brosnan ,  looking aged and almost used up ,  sinks his teeth into the role of julian in a way he never has before .  playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being ,  brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment ,  then genuine and sympathetic the next .  he always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale .  kinnear is also excellent as the regular joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the dark side as his relationship with julian deepens .  hope davis does a fine job as  " bean ,  "  danny's loyal and loving wife who ,  like her husband ,  finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and  " dangerous "  figure from a world far different from the one she knows .   at times ,  we find ourselves feeling that  " the matador "  is holding something back from us ,  not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise .  at the end it feels a little too light ,  a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should .  this could be because this is the feature film debut for writer/director richard shephard ,  and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet .  still ,  one appreciates the fact that he doesn't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece ,  rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh .   'the matador "  is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will ,  hopefully ,  signal a new phase in brosnan's acting career . 
what a great film it is .  the notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky .  the ending is not just a fitting one ,  it's more inspirational .   but i am intrigued by the characters .  it is a pity we never see the relationship of achilles and athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and athena's fear for achilles's safety .  their romance is very enjoyable .   
i remember this movie from when i was 12 ,  it was amazing .  .  i remember it to the day not like most thing i watched back then ,  i have even tried to buy it but its like rocking horse sh*t !  anyway ,  the acting is a bit chewy but the story is amazing considering it was a real b movie with a low budget and event the fighting scenes were amazing to watch ,  i must have watched it about 20 times .  it was a very well made movie and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robots ,  pity they had to spoil it by making a crappy spin off  " crash and burn "  ,  don't watch that movie by the way it is total pants !  if your a real sci-fi movie fan then watch this ,  if it was re-made today it would be a winner .  .  i really would love to see a remake or even release the dvd of it . 
now i've always been a fan of full moon's puppet work .  but i have to say that robot jox is one of there better projects .  yes ,  you heard me .  the story works wonderful ,  the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job .  gary graham who really makes his mark on tv in shows like alien nation the series and star trek enterprise shows that he can be an action star who kicks ass and takes name .  the stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better .  the color was wrong ,  they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be .  but that is a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the robot jox ,  if you like gary graham or other full moon movies ,  then you will like this movie .  9 stars out of 10 . 
this movie i've loved since i was young !  its excellent .  although ,  it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one can't interpret certain subtleties in the film  ( for example ,  our hero's name is achilles ,  and in the final battle between him and alexander he's shot in the heel with a rocket ,  just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel )  .  that's a just a little fact that is kind of amusing !  anyway ,  great movie ,  good story ,  it'd be neat to see it redone with today's special effects !  oddly enough ,  gary graham had average success ,  starring in the t . v .  show alien nation .  this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated ! 
if you like mech war games it's pretty good .  some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing .  i've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie i've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs .  if you like the genera then games you like are mech warrior three and four and if you have an xbox and $350 to spare steel battalion .  the movie is worth seeing at least once .  there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there .  less remakes and more original works .    enjoy
robot jox tries hard ,  but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together -- robot against robot ,  man against man ,  man against woman .  the premise had potential ,  but it seems the script wasn't really given the couple of more drafts it needed .  still ,  it was fairly good ,  for a science fiction action movie .  part of it was because the script was by joe haldeman .  for those who aren't familiar with the name ,  haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel  " the forever war .  "  it's considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels ,  right up there with robert heinlein's  " starship troopers "  and john steakley's  " armor .  "  and this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie ,  rather than giant robots .  it's closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was paul verhoeven's  " starship troopers ,  "  which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on .   despite some assumptions ,  this really isn't based on homer's  " iliad .  "  a couple of names are all they had in common .  achilles having his robot's foot blown off had no parallel in the iliad ,  which didn't include achilles' death .  nor was the ancient achilles a noble warrior .  he was the mightiest ,  but also vengeful and petty .  even the robot jock killed off in the first scene doesn't fit .  he was named hercules ,  while the greek iliad would have had herakles .   the effects were fairly good for the time and the budget .  true ,  it wasn't comparable to  " terminator 2 "  a year later ,  but that movie cost ten times as much .  the stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in  " the empire strikes back "  and  " return of the jedi .  "  better ,  in fact ,  than a lot of ray harryhausen animation ,  which is highly regarded ,  but quite dated .   don't bring high expectations into this and you probably won't be disappointed .  it's better than a lot of other low-budget flicks and even some big-budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts . 
i read somewhere  ( in a fairly panning review )  that this is something of a live-action mecha anime ,  and i think they're on the right lines .  i first watched this movie when i was very young and i've been dying to see it again ,  and when i finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back .  i don't think this is to be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of good old 80's almost-a-tv-movie fun  ( it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future ,  although this point isn't stressed too much )  .  what i admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didn't sound generic - no clichés ,  no predictable lines - all in all just good fun !  maybe time hasn't been kind to this little movie ,  but still i can find appreciation for it in me .  it's by no means perfect ,  but it's entertaining and doesn't try to be anything other than that .  let the nerds and comic-store-guys worry about technicalities - who cares ?  see it for yourself and make your own decision .  no-one else's opinion matters . 
this film seems to get bad critiscism for some reason .  probably just by the mass populace .  anyhow ,  this is actually a very interesting movie .  the film is an under-budget sci-fi movie which actually works ,  due to an interesting storyline and well done scenes .    this movie may not be for everyone though .  if there are any sci-fi fans reading this ,  i truly recommend this movie if you like good ole science fiction .  the film has crazy ideas .  the setting includes nations going to war with gigantic machines which the entire countries invest all it's money in !  the world has been divied up into territories .  anyone can challenge anyone else to a war ,  or rather ,  a 'robot-duel' .  the method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war ,  since now everyone is wearing those breath masks .  definetly a movie that makes you think .  intelligent ,  well written ,  and good effects for the measly budget .   i tend to like movies which have small budgets and actually work . 
so one person says ,   " this movie is a beautiful ,  delicate exploration of west german life after world war ii .  "  and the other says ,   " former nazis living in bombed out buildings ,  and the movie is 'beautiful ,  delicate' ?  "  and the first sits there nodding ,  takes another sip of coffee .   " i can't explain .  just see it .  " 
this first part of the brd trilogy has more passion and plot density than lola ,  but less of the magic of veronica voss .  the political musings have point to them :  we see the shortages after the war ,  how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day-to-day life  ( delicious moment when fassbinder ,  playing a grifter ,  tries to sell a complete set of kleist to schygulla ,  who remarks that burning books don't provide much warmth :  she really wants firewood )  .   there's some clumsiness in the first hour .  the scene in maria's room with the black soldier ,  interrupted by hermann's appearance should go quicker .  the train scene when maria meets karl oswald falls flat when she insults the gi--i cringed ,  it was so bad .  but as the story develops and the years go by ,  i was drawn more and more into this glossy ,  cold world . 
maria braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly ,  despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility .  she will do everything to make her marriage work ,  including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation .  and thus beneath the vicey exterior ,  she reveals a rather sweet value system .  the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate ,  with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with 'and then i woke up' .  it is also book-ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence i've ever seen ,  but don't let any of that put you off . 
this is the best of the 43 films that rainer werner fassbinder made ;  his most successful at least .  he was one of the leading directors in the new germany after wwii .   hanna schygulla was magnificent as the cold ,  calculating maria bruan ,  who lost her husband to the war ,  found him after she took an american soldier as a lover ,  lost him again after he went to jail for her ,  and found him agin at the end .  her day and a half marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together at the end .   such is life .  things come and go ,  and you do the best you can .  you can give up or adjust you way of thinking to survive .  even though maria adjusted her thinking and did what she had to do ,  she never stopped loving hermann ,  which makes the end such a tragedy .   excellent drama . 
***1/2 pierce brosnan ,  greg kinnear ,  hope davis ,  adam scott ,  philip baker hall .  directed by richard shepard .   a well formulated story and film all together ,  brosnan has never been better in a film role outside of his  " bond "  movies .  after 2004's  " after the sunset "  his newest role brings in the laughs and a great time .  professional hit-man ,  so to speak ,  julian noble on a job in mexico city winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man danny wright  ( kinnear ,  possibly one of his best roles )  also on business there .  the two on-screen duo produce a comically charged ,  laugh riot and fail to not deliver the laughs .  davis in one of her best roles since  " american splendor "  gives another charming and witty performance .  one of the years most enjoyable and best films .  my final rating 9/10
my first fassbinder was a wonderful experience .  film and alternative cinema  ( small hall ,  with uncomfortable seats ;  public had to wait while filmrolls were changed  )  were perfect match .   there were many cliches used in the film ,  but fassbinder presented them so cleverly that i found them really amusing .  sound was also brilliant  ( sometimes back being louder than dialogue )  .   everything seemed to be in right place .  and i loved the way how after-war-time was presented .  real fun !   
fassbinder's most lavish production sacrifices little of his talent for identifying and deconstructing a locus of suffering in long ,  mobile takes that somehow also act as social encapsulations ;  here ,  it's much more overt ,  since the story takes place in war-torn germany at the end of wwii ,  and the central character is a woman  ( hanna schygulla as maria )  who capitalizes on vulnerabilities  ( both economic and gender-related )  to catapult herself up the ladder of a prominent textile corp .  that makes coveted goods like lederhosen available to indigent workers  ( as she once was )  .  married amidst allied air raids ,  maria and her new husband herrmann are allowed a brief honeymoon before he's shipped out to the russian front .  in his absence ,  her despair is great :  she spends most days at the train station ,  waiting for him to return .  when he is reported dead ,  she abruptly stops grieving and takes a job as a barmaid/prostitute at a brothel catering to american gi's .   when he returns ,  things get plenty messy ,  as circumstances  ( and his sense of noble self-sacrifice )  conspire to keep them apart .  the message is fassbinder's m . o .  writ large :  'love is colder than death , ' but not only is maria contending with her own sanity and a husband largely incapable of loving her ,  but a country in deep flux with no discernible light at the end of the tunnel .  fassbinder is making some kind of statement on post-war germany selling out to the highest bidder ,  but as with all his films ,  i tend to block those elements out and focus on the unbearable passions on display :  fassbinder's as evoked through his characters ;  his actors' as filtered through their real-life connections with fassbinder .  taken together ,  his films can be either unbearable or indescribably mesmeric ,  often at once ;  this falls somewhere in-between ,  although definitely closer to the latter .  while i didn't like it quite as much as the bitter tears of petra von kant or katzelmacher ,  maria braun certainly has a greater scope and what's more ,  i could feel its passion and authentic detail to human emotions . 
this film exhibits artful cinematic techniques wherein instead of landscape capturing the attention of the camera it is small details in how someone appears ,  how the woman may be wearing a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet .  how the husband may be wearing a hat and socks and shoes and his underwear and both seem so completely at ease and comfortable .  how provocative the woman is posed is another feature of the tableau that the director chooses to let us know she is a free spirit sexually and aims to get the pleasure she seeks without flirting directly or with any particular sensitivity to what the man may be feeling .  the relationship between the wife and husband is unique .  it is an open one wherein she holds nothing back ,  feels no particular shame for how she has behaved and wants to share these facts with him because her primary focus always is on the fact of their marriage .  nothing and no one can come between the two of them .  only the chances of fate can intervene---his imprisonment during the war and what follows after his return at long last .  a very intriguing film which is totally absorbing . 
the marriage of maria braun  ( mmb )  is about a german girl  ( maria )  getting married to a german soldier  ( herman braun )  just at the ending of the war .  after being married for half a day and a night ,  herman is send to the front again .  to make ends meet ,  maria starts working at a bar for mainly american soldiers and get to know a black soldier .  she got word that herman died at the front ,  and things develop between her and the american soldier .  herman walks in on them ,  in bed ,  and after a confrontation between him and the american ,  maria killed the american .  herman admits to the murder ,  ends up in jail and maria vows to wait for him .  the country is in shambles ;  one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette .  there are food shortages .  it is in short ,  a time of survival of the fittest .    basically this film projects maria's attitudes - those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances ,  as a metaphor for germany's loss of soul after they lost the war ,  and how it proceeds to rebuild itself .  for example ,  maria has the following conversation with a peddler  ( played by fassbinder himself )  ;  the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of kleist and she remarks that  " kleist burns out to quickly ,  it does not provide enough heat for the cold "  .  the peddler answers  " that's another way to look at it .  right now ,  it's probably the correct way "  .    maria meets a french/german business man ,  karl oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment .  she decides to get involve with karl ,   " you're not having an affair with me ;  i'm having an affair with you "  .  she also takes responsibility in the company ,  and after a while has the complete trust of the firm .  when karl says  " i suppose we'll just have to wait for a miracle "  she replies  " i prefer making miracles  then wait for them "  .  in her own words ,  she has become the  " mata hari of the economic miracle "  .   in a lot of fassbinder's films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms  ( see freud )  ;  in other words ,  he liked pointing his camera at the bullsh*t ,  the false social mechanisms ,  the pretending .  the direct approach maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology .  for example ,  she phones karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point  " i need someone to sleep with "  .  as fassbinder said  " the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society "  .  he also remarked that his films are anti emotional .    i particularly liked the scene when karl and maria meet in the munich restaurant  ( apparently ,  frequently visited by hitler himself )  .  maria appears in control and karl a bit on the down side ,  as if maria's 'brutal honesty' wears him out ,  as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore .  karl says  " i have to tell myself over and over that i love life "  .  maria replies  " that's life isn't it .  as if we signed a contract to enjoy life .  and then we go out to eat and talk about food "  .  i guess this is also about fassbinder attitudes on relationships ,  to never submit completely to anyone .  and why would you ,  if the central matter of most of his films is about  " what love becomes in this society  a commodity ,  an instrument of power ,  a weapon .  "   it was remarked that it is typical fassbinder to have the scenes with maria and betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war - with these clothing essentially the wrong period .  what i think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes ,  when you feel bad ,  that  " you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great "  .  but ,  fassbinder was not interested in perfection .  any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project .  since he completed films  ( approximately 4 a year )  the way other people rolled cigarettes ,  it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes .  peter marthesheimer ,  who wrote most of the script ,  mentioned that fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with maria and the american in the park ,  overnight .    hanna schygulla is brilliant as maria .  mostly ,  she just stares bluntly into the camera .  in maria's own words  " it is a bad time for emotions .  but ,  i like it like that "  .    there are different opinions about the end .  after karl died of a hart attack ,  herman finally shows up .   ( herman left for australia after he got out of prison ,  to  " become human again "  .  )  after the testament is delivered  ( made out to her and herman in half )  ,  maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette ,  and blow her and herman up .  for me it is obvious that she just did that by accident .  at the same time ,  she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true .  she must have felt as if she was not herself anymore .  she felt as if she had outlived herself . 
maria braun got married right in the middle of combat all around her and her husband hermann .  an explosion ripped through the building ,  to begin with ,  and she and hermann had to sign the papers on a pile of rubble on the street .  perhaps this may strike some as a heavy-handed metaphor for what's about to come :  marriage on the rocks ,  so to speak .  it's a betrothal where the husband goes off to war and is held in a russian prison camp ,  unbenownst to the helpless but hopeful and proud maria ,  who keeps standing by the depressing rubble of the train station as some come home ,  others don't ,  with a sign awaiting hermann .   trouble arises ,  as happens in rainer werner fassbinder's melodramas ,  and as its one of his best and most provocative ,  we see as maria  ( uncommonly gorgeous hanna schygulla in this role )  will do a two-face :  she'll stand by her man ,  even if it means working at a bar for american gi's and ,  even still after she hears from a fellow soldier that hermann has died will still stand by him as she sleeps with a black gi and comes close to bearing his child  ( that is ,  naturally ,  until he reappears and a murder occurs and he takes the rap so she can be safe )  ,  or working for a german businessman  ( effectively sympathetic ivan desny )  and becoming his sometimes mistress and rising star in the company .  maria will do whatever it takes to be successful ,  but she'll always be married .   it's hard to say there's anything about maria that isn't fascinating .  money ,  sex ,  power ,  all of these become interchangeable for maria .  she's like the feminist that has her cake and eats it with a sultry smile :  she gets to have a husband ,  more or less  ( actually a lot less until the last ten minutes of the film )  while obtaining things- a man who dotes on her whenever he can ,  a new and expensive house with servants ,  a secretary ,  money- that others around her aren't getting due to already being with a man or too weak in a position to rise anywhere  ( such as the secretary ,  played interestingly enough by fassbinder's own mother )  .   maria is sexy ,  confident ,  and all alone ,  with an idealized life going against a life that should be made in the shade .  she says of the two men- the american soldier and poor old and sick oswald- that she's fond of them ,  and at the same time will stick by those roses the confused and soul-searching husband hermann sends from canada ,  after being released from prison .  she's casts a profile that a feminist would love to trounce ,  but understand where she's coming from and going all the way .   fassbinder employs this inherent contradiction ,  and moments with maria appear to go against the conventions of a melodrama  ( for example ,  hermann walking in on the jubilant and half-naked maria and gi is just about a masterpiece of a scene ,  with maria's reaction not of surprise or guilt but pure happiness to see that he's there let alone alive )  ,  while sticking to his guns as a director of such high-minded technique with a storyline that should be predictable .  but it isn't really .  it's like one big metaphor for a country that ,  after the war ,  couldn't really move on to normalcy .  a few times fassbinder puts sound of the radio on in the background ,  and we see maria walking around her family house ,  hustle and bustle going on around her ,  and the radio speaks of a divided germany ,  of things still very unsettled ,  of a disarray .  maybe the only way to cope is excess ,  or maybe that's just my interpretation of it .   it's hard to tell ,  really ,  under schygulla's stare face and eyes ,  anyway .  it's such an incredible performance ,  really ,  one of those showstoppers that captures the glamor and allure of an old-time hollywood female star while with the down-and-dirty ethic of a girl of the streets .  most telling are the opposing costumes one sees in one scene when she finally is with her husband ,  where she stars in one of those super-lustful black lingerie pieces and high heels ,  and then moves on to a dress without even thinking about it .  that's almost the essence of what maria is ,  and schygulla wonderfully gets it down ,  a headstrong but somehow loving figure who is adored and perplexed by the men around her ,  sometimes in a single sentence .  this is what fassbinder captures in his wonderful first part of his  " trilogy "  ;  while i might overall prefer veronika voss as a masterpiece ,  maria braun is perhaps just as good as a character study ,  of what makes a woman tick and tock with  ( almost )  nothing to lose . 
***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** this is without a doubt the best film rainer werner fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by hanna schygulla .  film starts out with maria  ( schygulla )  and hermann braun  ( klaus lowitsch )  just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive .  maria decides to get a job as a dancer/prostitute in a club that caters to american gi's and she meets a black army soldier named bill  ( greg eagles )  and they start to see one another on a steady basis .  maria hears that her husband hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with bill .  but one day while getting intimate with bill they see hermann at the door .  he hasn't died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and maria breaks a bottle over bill's head and he dies .  hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out .  the war has ended and germany must rebuild and one day on a train maria meets karl oswald  ( ivan desny )  who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job .  maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes karl's mistress .  she tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her .  hermann gets out of jail but goes to canada to try and get over everything that maria has done since he has been locked up .   *****spoiler alert*****  one day karl dies and leaves maria just about everything in his will and maria buys her own house .  then hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they're marriage even though they have been married for some time now .  but maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it .   there are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths .  like in all fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way .  as the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn germany but as maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white .  the rebuilding of germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of maria .  fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in germany at that time .  hanna schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film .  with a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status .  schygulla shows maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants .  she's not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and fassbinder wanted to show maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive .  schygulla wasn't nominated for an academy award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time .  fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother lilo pempeit plays frau ehmke .  i have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether maria purposely left the gas on .  later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad .  this is only speculation and if you think i'm wrong please e-mail me .  i think she was overly excited by hermann being home and left it on by accident  ( remember her putting on a dress for no reason ?  )  .  then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that hermann and karl had become friendly without her knowledge and i think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing .  thats the reason for the bathroom scene .  so when the house explodes its by accident .  but i think the reason for fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living .  fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate .  in his view maria can't have it both ways .  a fascinating film . 
sensual and tough maria braun .   ( hanna schygula )  marries a soldier in the middle of world war ii and spends a half of day and the whole night with him .  that's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison .  she carries on with her life ,  becomes a successful businesswoman being not only sensual but intelligent ,  ambitious ,  and willing to use sex whenever or wherever necessary :   " i don't know a thing about business ,  but i do know what german women want .  you might even say i'm an expert on it "  .  while climbing up to the success she always remembers her husband ,  hermann  ( her man )  and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him ,  for their future happy life together .   " maria braun " 's style reminds much of melodramas by fassbinder's favorite hollywood director ,  douglas sirk and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar germany .  hanna schygula literally shines in every scene of the movie and she is fantastic .   8 . 5/10
this movie earned every one of the ten votes i gave it !  thank you guys for making a movie worth watching .  you showed the world , you can still write ,  direct ,  produce and star in a black movie without the negative stereotypes .  the poetry was awesome as well ,  hats off to the poets and musicians .   i watched it last night ,  as i fell in love with my darling all over again .  i will be adding it to my movie collection today ,  and recommending it to my friends and family .   please continue to produce quality ,  don't worry about the quantity .  .  .  .   thank you again ,  and best wishes and blesses to you ! 
think pierce brosnan and you think suave ,  dapper ,  intelligent james bond .  in this movie ,  brosnan plays against type - and has lots of fun doing so  ( as does the audience )  .  this is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman .  .  .  and it works !   this is a fun movie ,  with very good scenes  ( a riveting ,  on-the-edge brosnan and a good ,  compliant  " off " -the-edge kinnear have some good lines )  .  my only cavil is that hope davis ,  playing the oh-so-tolerant wife  (  " can i see your gun ?  "  )  doesn't appear more often :  she could have been a marvellous foil to these men .   this movie is like a matador :  it plays with the audience ,  while  " going for a kill "  .  the ending is awesome because a storyline  ( with a positive moral !  )  emerges :  this is a frenetic ,  frantic and fun movie ,  which does deserve a wide audience . 
a realistic depiction of young love for the college set but also appealing to an older viewer like me .  it has ups and downs and twists and turns and made me shed a tear or two .  we rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to older ,  non black audiences and show a more real life depiction of young black adults .   this movie takes place on a college campus and town where two people meet and fall in love .  in the background are various friends acquaintances and situations that impact them for better or worse .  typical plot some may say ,  but this really was unexpected .    i found myself rooting for the survival of the couple's relationship ,  seeing my own past in their story .  moments of deep thought and revelation came pouring out of the actors performances .    it's a bright film that i would endorse for those young at heart and in love or have ever been in love .  great movie .  i'll be looking for a copy to add to my movie collection . 
love trap is not a short ,  it's quite obviously a full length feature film with a running time of 105 minutes .   while i'm writing this ,  i might as well talk a bit more about love trap .  i'm frequently asked what makes love trap different .  .  .  this is how i respond to that question :  1 )  it introduces characters - one in particular - that have never been seen before in film ,  period .   2 )  it reveals more truth about love ,  and delves more deeply into the very concept of love ,  than any other u . s .  film ever made ,  in my humble opinion .   3 )  structurally ,  as in the way the story is told ,  it is unlike any love story you've ever seen .   4 )  it offers extremely timely insights on various cultural issues ,  both within and outside the black community .   over time ,  people will come to see love trap as about as wholly an original work as possible in this era ,  delightfully refreshing ,  authentic and honest .  it is a rare morality play full of food for thought .   please visit www . lovetrapmovie . com for complete and accurate info about this film . 
i picked this film up at my local library .  having met the director at a film festival late last year ,  i was curious to  " check out "  his work .  i was pleasantly surprised .   the film takes a fresh look at familiar subjects ,  love ,  infidelity ,  friendships ,  jealousy .  it can be a bit 'talky' at times but never so much as to completely sink the film .  i enjoyed watching a love story with characters that clearly belong together and watching them make conscious decisions rather than haphazardly  " falling "  into something as important as love .   the contrast between this film and the average low-budget shoot-em' up black film is quite distinct .  check it out .  if you're lucky ,  your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine did .  good stuff ! 
love trap is a  " must see "  independent film .  when i sat down to watch the movie ,  i came in with low expectations ,  but left with a blessing .  the story is poetic ,  substantive ,  and creative .  the writer pulls you in further and further which each scene ,  allowing you to relate to the realistic characters that every one can identify with .  the movie allowed me to reflect on my life and what i consider love to be .  the movie displayed what love really is ,  action not emotion .  i was also impressed with the quality of the cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie .  the entire presentation surpassed my expectations .  i give the movie two big thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and all backgrounds . 
the van is a simple teensploitation picture made especially for the drive in that goes out of it's way to make you feel comfortable ,  providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends .  danny devito has a small yet plentiful role as the manager of a car wash and almost steals the show !  all the leads are well acted ,  the characters complex and the directing quite competent for this type of picture .  a crown international release . 
i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way !  i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched ,  it .  this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format .   holy guacamole !  how i wish those days would come again .  i tried putting a bubble window on the side of my car  ( honda civic 1984 )  ,  but the vacuum formed muffin trays didn't quite cut it .  also in my civic ,  sexual positions are limited and are not supported by water bed as is brilliantly depicted in 'the van' .   'the van' is of the utmost side splitting hilarity and can even substitute for porn if you watch some scenes privately .   i highly anticipate that sam grossman  ( the director )  has achieved his opus .   ratings john :  ****1/2 sam :  *****
simple-minded but good-natured drive-in movie about a simple-minded but good-natured high school graduate who has dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as his  " ballroom "  .    bobby ,  our hero ,  spends his entire savings to acquire the vehicle of his dreams .  joint sharing and love making quickly commence with girls bobby has picked up at the local pizza parlor ,  but he finds out much responsibility ,  danger and heartache come with being the owner of such a mechanical marvel .   the van is a guilty pleasure of mine .  it captures the laid back mid 70's mood and has enough unintentional humor to put it into the  " so bad it's good "  category . 
i am proud to say i own an uncut copy of this choice chunk of 70's crown international drive-in sexploitation comedy cheese on dvd .  it's a really goofy and enjoyably inconsequential flick with a nicely breezy'n'easy 70's vibe to it .  it does attempt to make a sincere point about true love and friendship being more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a quick piece of tail .  sure ,  it's essentially a blatant adolescent male fantasy pic -- the main teen goofus character bobby hamilton gets the girls ,  the respect of his friends ,  and a chance to show-up a local van-racing bully -- but it's way too dopey and good-natured to hate .  stuart getz as our gawky protagonist makes for an endearingly dorky lead ,  deborah white as the main object of getz's affection is a definite cutie ,  connie lisa marie is likewise quite luscious as a beauteous blonde babe ,  and sneering beefcake neanderthal stephan oliver  ( a 60's biker movie perennial )  is wonderfully hateful as the brutish dugan hicks .  a pre-stardom danny devito in particular is an absolute riot as getz's cranky carwash owner boss andy ,  a lovably cantankerous ne'er-do-well slob who wears very ugly loud hawaiian shirts and suffers from a severe gambling habit .  i especially love the scene where two thugs brutally beat danny up -- one holds his arms behind his back while the other guy works over danny's torso !  and sammy johns' insidiously catchy fluke hit theme song will be bouncing around your skull for at least a week .  in short ,  it's great groovy retro-70's fun ! 
in 1979 ,  i was a boy of 12 years old ,  my parents had just got the home box office which was pretty new to our neighborhood .  as a 12 year old boy ,  this was the first time i saw boobs on television .  i will never forget the joy of those times .  racing vans ,  the total ass-wipe with the baddest van ,  the water bed ,  the smoking of herbs ,  the hot 70's chicks ,  the 'makin love in my chevy van song ,  it was all so new to me .  a complete movie with all of the memories you could hope for .  i own it and enjoy it about once a year .  when i watch this movie ,  it makes me want to get my skates ,  with 4 wheels ,  not in a strait line ,  go to the park and hunt down some babes with feathered hair .  truly great memories of young adolescence ! 
 .  .  . this is ,  above all else ,  the typical crown international pictures drive-in  ( read  " passion pit "  )  programmer .  the 1975 sammy johns hit record  " chevy van "  is heard repeatedly on the soundtrack  ( this movie has even been reissued with the title chevy van )  ,  despite the film's title vehicle being a dodge .  danny devito makes only six minutes of on-screen appearance ,  but countless vhs reissues falsely credit him as the star of the flick .  the movie is a comparatively sexist morality tale -- will bobby find sexual satisfaction through the one-night-stand his customised van facilitates ,  or must he wait until tina ,  the girl of his dreams ,  gives him the time of day ?  still ,  it is representative of the prevailing carnal dream of male american high schoolers of the time ,  and on that basis alone the van has ,  almost in spite of itself ,  become an artifact of the period that must be referenced in any honest retrospective of the period's popular american cinema .  .  . 
 " it wasn't me !  it was ,  er ,  my twin brother rupert !  "  bobby says to dugan when confronted about being over at sally's place .  i have used this line dozens of times over the years  ( no one has yet to believe it ,  though )  .   this movie is one of the all-time best for sheer fun and nonbelieveability .  steven oliver was perfect for the part of dugan ,  so much so that he was in 1978's  " malibu beach "  as the same character  ( not nearly as much screen time ,  though )  .    " nobody calls dugan a turd !  "  is another line for the ages .  this classic film was definitely worth the price of admission . 
a good film ,  and one i'll watch a number of times .  rich  ( the previous commenter ) is right :  there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards ,  and i have to wonder how much has suffered in translation .  were there more in the original ?  or was a native-language audience expected to lip-read more ?  or -- since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based -- was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar ?  in short ,  very worth a look ,  but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into it .   the alpha video release touts the new organ score ,  but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way .  sure ,  it starts promisingly ,  but degenerates into a repetitive ,  phillip-glass-like monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen .  after listening for a while ,  i turned off the sound and simply watched :  much better ! 
wasn't sure what to expect from this film .  i love watching brosnan in any movie ,  he's always good ,  but this was totally different .  he's a mess ,  and plays being a mess very well .  in fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni  :  )  so yes ,  there's not a lot of violence ,  there's not a lot of action ,  but the dialogue is cracking ,  the acting is superb and very refreshing ,  and it's pretty funny too  :  )  i don't think you'll come out of the cinema going  " wow !  i was blown away "  ,  but you'll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film .  can't ask for more than that .   oh ,  and if you're lucky ,  some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and you'll get inverted ,  upside down ,  reversed  ( with reversed audio )  adverts !  !  brilliant .  nothing like watching a jack daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff american  " twin peaks "  commentary  :  ) 
in this truly fascinating ,  dark film ,  a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money ,  in return the devil takes his mirror image  ( this is done brilliantly in the movie and eerily presaged when balduin ,  the student is earlier practicing swordsmanship in front of the mirror )  ,  a visual metaphor for a  " man at war with himself "  which portents his immediate future .  the student enjoys his money ,  but the woman he loves is unattainable  ( he has made a pact with the devil ,  he is cut off forever from love and other riches of the soul )  you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money ,  you cannot have both .  balduin is haunted by his double  ( the intertitles express this beautifully as does the action .  some of the scenes are incredible ,  the sense of doom when the devil disappears with balduin's mirror image is amazing ,  as is the sense that his pact has forever cut him off from human society  ( the scene where he runs away from his double and ends up in the 'wasteland' at the edge of the town ,  no longer entirely human  ( he has lost his soul )  he is like a hunted animal outside of human society .  there are so many other things to say about this incredible film .  paul wegener was an amazing actor and director ,  a cultural hero of mine .  it helps if you know a bit about german history at the time this film was made and about german doppelganger tradition  ( don't google it ,  get a proper book ) just remember ,  it's a very early film ,  it's a little clumsy at times ,  but considering what it has to say and it's tragic finale ,  it's one of the best ever  ( yes it is !  ) 
i used this film in a religion class i was teaching .  the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment .  a young boy and his mother are away from home .  the boy has been given money to buy milk .  on the way home ,  he stops at carnival to play a game .  next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary .  the boy drops the bottle of milk .  it breaks .  the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk .  this scene alternates with what is happening at home .  a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment .  he (  ?  )  discovers the fish bowl and watches it .  the fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl .  by now ,  a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish .  the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath .  the cat drops the fish into the bowl .  the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat .  both inspire prejudice .  both are innocent .  it was a great discussion starter in my class . 
i found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy .  brosnan is genius ;  as anyone will now testify ,  he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role .  kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role .  i don't know if i've laughed as hard during any movie !  what an unexpected pleasure !  my favourite line would be 'i feel like a bangkok hooker on a sunday after the navy left town' .  brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comedic finesse .  i was also very impressed with hope davis's performance .  it seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy .  if you liked the dark and hilarious 'the weather man' ,  you will definitely like this .    i voted 10 . 
this early version of the tale 'the student of prague' was made in germany in 1913 ,  starring paul wegener  ( who was also in 'the golem' a few years later )  .  in this film he plays a dual role  ( technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot )  after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess he's previously saved from drowning .   moving at a fast pace  ( the film runs just over an hour )  and fairly well written and characterised ,  'the student of prague' has echoes of the faust legend as well as dr jekyll and mr hyde ,  starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil ,  and developing into good and evil sides of the same person . 
those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have figured out some of its potential very early on .  this is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to satan for a lot of money .  unfortunately ,  the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently ,  tearing his life apart .  there are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and ,  of course ,  the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time .  the middle part is a bit dull ,  but the faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer .  one thing i have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie .  also ,  they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing .  i first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it .  i was not disappointed . 
a stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman--so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense .  an evil magician approaches him and informs him he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the lady's heart if he agrees to give him anything he wants that's within their room .  the dumb guy agrees and the magician steals the man's reflection out of the mirror--and bad things naturally occur as a result .   if this film had been made just a decade later ,  i am sure i wouldn't have been so charitable in reviewing and scoring this film .  after all ,  the film's plot is a bit vague in spots and the acting is ,  at times ,  a bit stilted .  however ,  when you consider that in 1913  " full-length "  films were rare--and often only 20 to 30 minutes long !  plus ,  the whole idea of a complex story like you get in this film is very unusual--as stories were very short and broadly acted .  so ,  given the limitations of the time ,  this film is pretty good and is one of the earlier horror films known . 
'the student of prague' is an early feature-length horror drama or ,  rather ,  it is an  " autorenfilm "   ( i . e .  an author's film )  .  this film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to lend respectability to cinéma ,  or just make a profit ,  by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen .  fortunately ,  the story of this book with moving pictures is good .  using alfred de musset's poem and a story by edgar allen poe ,  it centres on the doppelgänger theme .   unfortunately ,  the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make paul wegener appear twice within scenes .  guido seeber was a special effects wizard for his day ,  but he's not very good at positioning the camera or moving it .  film scholar leon hunt  ( printed in  " early cinema :  space ,  frame ,  narrative "  )  ,  however ,  has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme :  characters being split by left/right ,  near/far and frontal/diagonal framing of characters and shots .  regardless ,  the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position ,  which is noticeably primitive .  worse is the lack of editing ;  there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger .  none of this is unusual for 1913 ,  but there were more advanced films in this respect around the same time ,  including the better parts of 'atlantis'  ( august blom ,  1913 )  ,  'twilight of a woman's soul'  ( yevgeni bauer ,  1913 )  and the short films of d . w .  griffith .   an expanded universal film vocabulary by 1926 would allow for a vastly superior remake .  furthermore ,  the remake has a reason for the lyduschka character ,  other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate .  here ,  the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around ,  seemingly ,  with a cloak of invisibility .  i know their world is silent to me ,  but i assume ,  with their lips moving and such ,  that their world would not be silent to them ,  so how can lyduschka leer over others' shoulders and not be noticed ?   nevertheless ,  this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually .  wegener ,  who seems to have been the primary mind behind this film ,  in addition to playing the lead ,  would later play the title role and co-direct 'the golem' in 1920--helping to further inaugurate the supernatural thread in german silent cinéma .    ( note :  the first version i viewed was about an hour long  ( surely not quite complete )  and was in poor condition ,  with faces bleached at times and such .  i'm not sure who was the distributor .  i've also since seen the alpha dvd ,  which ,  at 41 minutes ,  is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards ,  but is visually not as bad .  the repetitive score is best muted ,  though .  ) 
if  " the cabinet of dr .  caligari "  is the father of all horror films  ( and of german expressionist cinema )  ,  this pre-wwi film is the grandfather .  the titular student ,  starving in an empty garret ,  makes a deal with the devil-- the devil gives him a bottomless sack of gold ,  in exchange for  " anything in this room .  "  the devil chooses the student's reflection in his mirror .  he walks off with the student's doppelganger ,  who commits crimes for which the student is blamed .   the film is marred by some limitations arising out of the technically primitive state of 1913 filmmaking ;  the plot cries out for chiaroschuro effects ,  but the film is ,  of necessity ,  virtually all shot in shadowless daylight .  but the scene where the reflection walks out of the mirror still packs a wallop .   more interesting for the trends it fortells than for its own sake ,  the student of prague is still worthwhile . 
one of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt german expressionism ,  the highly atmospheric style of film-making developed during the 20s in berlin .  classic movies like  " das cabinet des dr .  caligari .  "   ( 1920 )  and  " nosferatu ,  eine symphonie des grauens "   ( 1922 )  were the most famous direct results of this movement ,  and while the movement didn't have a long life ,  its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today ,  specially in the horror genre .  one of the key figures of this style would be director paul wegener ,  director of 1920's  " der golem ,  wie er in die welt kam "  ,  as in his debut as a filmmaker ,  seven years before the making of that classic ,  he was already making experiments with expressionism in film .  that early prototype of german expressionism was incidentally ,  another horror film :   " der student von prag "  .    " der student von prag "   (  " the student of prague "  )  ,  is the story of balduin  ( paul wegener )  ,  a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in prague ,  but who always find himself with financial troubles .  one day ,  balduin rescues the beautiful countess margit  ( grete berger )  from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident .  balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again ,  but soon he discovers that he'll have to compete with her rich cousin ,  graf von schwarzenberg  ( lothar körner )  ,  who also wants to marry her .  knowing that he can't offer her much ,  balduin wishes to be wealthy ,  and this is where a sorcerer named scapinelli  ( john gottowt )  enters the scene .  scapinelli offers balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room .  balduin accepts the proposal ,  only to discover in horror that what scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror .   loosely inspired by edgar allan poe's short story  " william wilson "  and the classic legend of  " faust "  ,  the story of  " der student von prag "  was conceived by german writer hanns heinz ewers ,  a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature .  written at a time where cinema in germany was still being developed as an art form ,   " der student von prag "  shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes .  like most of the scriptwriters of his time ,  ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater ,  although  " der student von prag "  begins to move away from that style .  while a bit poor on its character development  ( specially on the supporting characters )  ,  ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of balduin .   while  " der student von prag "  was paul wegener's directorial debut and stellan rye's second film as a filmmaker ,  it's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly .  giving great use to guido seeber's cinematography ,  the two young filmmakers create a powerful gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the german filmmakers of the following decade would do .  wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his  " golem "  series from seeber and rye .  despite having very limited resources ,  rye and wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing  ( for its time )  visual effect for the scenes with balduin's reflection  ( played by wegener too )  .  already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film ,  wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers .   as balduin ,  paul wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie .  it certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer ,  but one can't deny that wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract .  john gottowt plays the sinister scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove .  few is said about scapinelli in the film ,  but gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared .  the rest of the main cast is less lucky ,  with grete berger being pretty much average as countess margit ,  and lothar körner making a poor graf von schwarzenberg .  however ,  it must be said that lyda salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and fritz weidemann made an excellent baron waldis-schwarzenberg ,  showing the dignity that lörner's character should have had .   considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake  ( made 13 years after this film )  is superior in every possible way ,  it's not difficult to understand why  " der student von prag "  hasn't stood the test of time as well as other early films .  the movie's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget ,  as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what ewers' story needed to be fully developed .  this makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times ,  or even incomplete ,  as if there was something missing in the narrative  ( of course ,  there's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete )  .  however ,   " der student von prag "  is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that ,  while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time ,  left a powerful impression in history .   as the direct predecessor of the german expressionist movement ,  it's hard to deny the enormous importance that  " der student von prag "  has in the history of german cinema ,  probably in the history of cinema in general .  it may look dated even for its time ,  but considering the limited resources its director had ,  it's truly better than most films from that era .  as the movie that started paul wegener's career ,  and with that german expressionism ,   " der student von prag "  is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history .  7/10
while this movie's style isn't as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been ,  this is still a very good film .  in fact ,  it was seen as an excellent film in its day ,  as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar  ( losing to wings )  .  i still consider wings to be a superior film ,  but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead ,  emil jannings .   jannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a hollywood extra .  his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting call--to play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution .  naturally this isn't much of a stretch acting-wise ,  but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution .   exactly what happens next i'll leave to you ,  but it's a pretty good film--particularly at the end .  by the way ,  look for william powell as the russian director .  despite being made in 1928 ,  with the makeup he doesn't look much younger than he did in many of his later films . 
russian emigrant director in hollywood in 1928  ( william powell )  is casting his epic about the russian revolution ,  and hires an old ex-general from the czarist regime  ( emil jannings )  to play the general of the film ,  and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared  ( evelyn brent )  ,  of 11 years before .   try as i might ,  i feel it hard to warm to 'the last command' for all its virtues .  'the docks of new york' was indubitably a great film ,  and 'underworld' is a film i have always been craving to see ,  but 'the last command' is rather heavy-going .  the premise is fascinating ,  but the treatment does really make the script come to life ,  except in the sequences set in hollywood ,  depicting the breadline of employable extras and the machinations of a big movie production with state-of-the-art technology .   emil jannings is ,  predictably ,  a marvelous russian general ,  distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old ex-general ,  transfixed in his misery ,  and the vigorous ,  hearty officer of yore .   the ending is great and worth the wait ,  but in order to get there you must prepared to be slightly bored at times . 
the last command  ( 1928 )  is a silent film directed by josef von sternberg . it shows us czarist general ,  grand duke sergius alexander  ( emil jannings )  in his days of glory . in 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of imperial russia he has nothing . he also had the love of a woman ,  natalie dabrova  ( evelyn brent )  . about ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution . his old enemy lev andreyev  ( william powell )  is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not . the last command is very good silent drama . emil jannings does memorable role work in the lead . evelyn brent is wonderful playing the woman lead . william powell is great as always . there are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie . like many scenes with jannings and brent . and then there is the ending with powell and jannings . this is a movie that touches in many parts . 
1927 ,  and hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade .  now that it had become the site of a multi-million dollar industry and the vertically integrated studio system had been established ,  some of those in the calmer quarters of this film-making factory were taking the time for a little self-reflection .  the last command ,  while its heart may be the classic story of a once prestigious man fallen on hard times ,  frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema unceremoniously recreates reality ,  and how its production process could be mercilessly impersonal .  it was written by lajos biro ,  who had been on the scene long enough to know .   taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among hollywood's most celebrated immigrants  emil jannings .  before coming to the states jannings had worked mainly in comedy ,  being a master of the hammy yet hilariously well-timed performance ,  often as pompous authority figures or doddering old has-beens .  he makes his entrance in the last command as the latter ,  and at first it looks as if this is to be another of jannings's scenery-chomping caricatures .  however ,  as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range ,  showing by turns delicate frailty ,  serene dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale .  he never quite stops being a blustering exaggeration  ( the german acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety )  ,  but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every facet of his performance .   the director was another immigrant ,  albeit one who had been around hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the european film industry .  nevertheless joseph von sternberg cultivated for himself the image of the artistic and imperious teutonic kino meister  ( the  " von "  was made up ,  by the way )  ,  and took a very distinctive approach to the craft .  of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone ,  a great example being the first of the russian flashback scenes .  we open with a carefully-constructed chaos with movement in converging directions ,  which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen .  then ,  when jannings arrives ,  everything settles down .  jannings's performance is incredibly sedate and measured ,  and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored order .   sternberg appears to show a distaste for violence ,  allowing the grimmest moments to take place off screen ,  and yet implying that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic .  in fact ,  he really seems to have an all-round lack of interest in action .  in the scene of the prisoners' revolt sternberg takes an aloof and objective stance ,  his camera eventually retreating to a fly-on-the-wall position .  compare this to the following scenes between jannings and evelyn brent ,  which are a complex medley of point-of-view shots and intense close-ups ,  thrusting us right into the midst of their interaction .   as a personality on set ,  it would seem that sternberg was much like the cold and callous director played on the screen by william powell ,  and in fact powell's portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even sternberg himself would have been in on .  unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with ,  and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones ,  the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired .  while jannings displays classic hamming in the charles laughton mode that works dramatically ,  it appears no-one told his co-stars they were not in a comedy .  evelyn brent is fairly good ,  giving us some good emoting ,  but overplaying it here and there .  the only performance that comes close to jannings is that of powell himself .  it's a little odd to see the normally amiable star of the thin man and the great ziegfeld playing a figure so stern and humourless ,  like a male ninotchka ,  but he does a good job ,  revealing a smouldering emotional intensity beneath the hard-hearted exterior .   the last command could easily have ruffled a few feathers in studio offices ,  as tends to happen with any disparaging commentary on the film-making process ,  even a relatively tame example like this .  at the very least ,  i believe many studio heads would have been displeased by the  " behind-the-scenes "  view ,  as it threatened the mystique of movie-making which was still very much alive at this point .  as it turned out ,  such was the impact of the picture that jannings won the first ever academy award for best actor ,  as well as a best writing nomination for lajos biro and  ( according to some sources ,  although the issue is a little vague )  a nomination for best picture .  this is significant ,  since the academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of self-indulgent back-slapping by the hollywood elite .  but elite or not ,  they recognised good material when they saw it ,  and were willing to reward it . 
josef von sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent hollywood and the former imperial general to the czar of russia who has found himself there .  emil jannings won a well-deserved oscar ,  in part ,  for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a russian general .  the movie flashes back to his days in russia leading up to the country's fall to revolutionaries .  william powell makes his big screen debut as the hollywood director who casts jannings in his film .  the film serves as an interesting look at the fall of russia and at an imitation of behind-the-scenes tinseltown in the early days .  von sternberg delivers yet another classic ,  and one that is filled with the great elements of romance ,  intrigue ,  and tragedy . 
an extra is called upon to play a general in a movie about the russian revolution .  however ,  he is not any ordinary extra .  he is serguis alexander ,  former commanding general of the russia armies who is now being forced to relive the same scene ,  which he suffered professional and personal tragedy in ,  to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionist in russia and was humiliated by alexander .  it can now be the time for this broken man to finally  " win "  his penultimate battle .  this is one powerful movie with meticulous direction by von sternberg ,  providing the greatest irony in alexander's character in every way he can .  jannings deserved his oscar for the role with a very moving performance playing the general at his peak and at his deepest valley .  powell lends a sinister support as the revenge minded director and brent is perfect in her role with her face and movements showing so much expression as jannings' love .  all around brilliance .  rating ,  10 . 
thats my bush is first of all a very entertaining show by parker and stone ,  i thought .  its often very very funny ,  and its quite subversive and crazy .  south park fans would surely get something here .    another surprise is the production value here .  a lot of money must have been put into this ,  and it shows .  a lot of expensive little details .  its not a little show .  and comedy central is not an extremely rich channel ,  but they put a lot into this show obviously .  in a way i understand that was the death of the show as well though ,  too costy .  it surely could have been done cheaper and went on the will was there .    the critics liked it ,  and it had its little fanbase ,  but it failed gaining a big audience .  as we know ,  the show stopped after 8 episodes ,  which i guess is almost 1 season .    as i really liked the show it has its faults .  the problem of the show is kind of that it doesn't know what it wants to be really .  its like it tries to be a sitcom and a parody of a sitcom at the same time .  the actors do a good job ,  and some of them are well casted ,  but in my opinion they seem to not always get 100% the bizarre humor they're supposed to present .    i personally think that the show needed some characters that were more down to earth for the show to work .  in south park you have kyle and stan ,  that are kind of a realistic touch in the more looney universe .  i think thats kind of what makes south park work .  you need some sane characters that you can relate to in a realistic way ,  and that makes the insane stuff so much more interesting too because that forces you to take them seriously at some level .  if everything is archetypes and stereotypes its difficult to get emotionally included in the show ,  which really is thats my bush biggest problem .  kyle and stan is characters in south park that makes sense of the insanity in the show .  we have nothing like that here ,  and this show suffers from it .    another anchorpoint is parker and stones flirting with republicans .  its the only thing about them i don't really get what they're trying to do .  not portraying bush as nothing else than a dumb homer simpsons lovable kind of character is kind of subversive in a world where a lot of people that can't stand him and think he's the worst president since nixon ,  and a parallel comedy world of letterman and so on that only satirizes his every move .  .  .  but its difficult to understand if parker and stone actually means anything by it .  its like the joke is on us ,  but somehow it doesn't hit the mark .  it seems awkward ,  because it doesn't remind you of the real bush at all .    besides that i actually thought the show was very enjoyable .  some of the jokes in here are hilarious .  the pro-life supporter who was a surviving aborted fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes by them in any show .  and the show is packed with great material ,  and is sometimes insanely funny if you use your head a little while watching it . 
that's my bush is a live action project made by south park creators trey parker and matt stone . the show was cancelled after one season ,  not because of bad reviews ( it actually got good reviews )  ,  but because it was very expensive . that's my bush is a pretty funny spoof of an average network tv sitcom . it is also a political satire . now ,  this is nowhere near as good as south park ,  but it is a very funny spoof of a sitcom and also a pretty good political satire . the guy who plays in that's my bush looks a lot like him !  if you can find the show ,  check it out . there are plenty of laughs to be had !   9/10
i finally watched these episodes in 2008 and i had to continually go back and verify when they were actually produced .  they are absolutely scary in that they made spot on fun of what would be the future .  either parker and stone lived in texas and witnessed the idiocy of gov bush or they are those weird ,  eerie people that pay attention to things .  boo ,  scary !  bush's frat bros invading the white house dressed as arabs wielding rifles ?  bush 'accidentally' executing someone ?   ( no ,  wait .  he did sort of do that as gov .  )  this may have seemed a failure as a sitcom at the time ,  but must now be considered as brilliant ,  if spooky ,  prescience . 
zatoichi the outlaw was the first film made by its hero's  ( shintaro katsu )  own production company ,  this is perhaps why this is a slightly lesser entry in the series ,  though it is by no means weak overall .  it tells of our hero coming across two towns ,  rival bosses and a mysterious ronin helping the poor and from this set up spins a tale encompassing tragedy ,  violence and no little interest ,  all served up with lashings of the unshowy but inspired swordplay that is one of the series trademarks .  it is a fairly predictable plot and it mounts in unsurprising fashion ,  but it zips along with style and is interesting stuff .  the helpful ronin for example is a nobly inscrutable revolutionary character ,  upsetting the established order without being painted as a truly likable or heroic figure ,  zatoichi himself makes one or two mistakes and causes harm by his actions ,  whilst the ruling system fuels the exploitation of the poor .  its a harsh world ,  with one or two more visceral than expected moments in the fighting ,  though things aren't as rousing as they could be .  shintaro katsu turns in a typical bravura performance as zatoichi ,  mixing wisdom ,  deadly skill and worldliness with a subtly sad sense of vulnerability ,  while solid work comes also from rentarô mikuni and an effectively baleful kô nishimura  ( later to appear as katsu's superior  " snake "  magobei in the hanzo trilogy )  as the two main bosses in the film .  there is also a good emotional turn from yuko hamada as a wronged woman .  the film loses out through shaky pacing and a not so well constructed sequence of events ,  there is at least one slightly jarring time jump and the power of the plot becomes a little lost ,  meaning that when things heat up towards the end the film isn't as exciting as it could be ,  emotional impact is lost also .  the action or scenes of zatoichi using his ingenious skills are well handled by director satsuo yamamoto ,  though some of the gambling is less interesting and the film builds up in a workmanlike rather than really inspired way ,  without the lively characters or strong verve of some other installments .  still ,  i enjoyed this one ,  it has its flaws and isn't one of the best of the series but it still packs a sweetly satisfying dose of entertainment ,  a good story and decent doses of zatoichi's trademark ingenious and quirky cool .  recommended for fans of the series ,  and a reasonable entry point ,  classy stuff though not a true great . 
this is one of the oddest films of the zatôichi series due to its very unusual pacing and the role that ichi plays in the film .  interestingly enough ,  this was the first zatôichi film made by shintaro katsu's new production company .  now ,  instead of just playing the blind swordsman ,  katsu is in charge of making the films .  this could easily explain why this film seems so different in style to the previous 15 films .  as far as ichi's role ,  the film is very different because he isn't in the film as much as usual .  he's also easy to fool and actually ,  for a while ,  does a lot to harm people instead of helping !     " zatôichi rôyaburi "  begins with ichi talking with an old lady who tries to take advantage of his blindness .  oddly ,  in this scene ,  ichi says that he's been blind since a toddler ,  though in an earlier film he says his blindness set in when he was 8 .  this is a minor mistake ,  and only a crazed fan like myself would have noticed .   this film takes place over a period of at least six months and is more likely to have taken a year--so you can see what i said about odd pacing .  most films in the series take place over a few days or weeks .  ichi comes to a town where there is a boss  ( asagoro )  who tries very hard to be nice to ichi because he knows of the blind man's reputation .  the boss is quite charming and surprisingly ichi is totally taken in by the evil man .  at the same time ,  he meets another boss  ( shushui ) --a sort of guru to the poor .  shushui admonishes the people to forsake all violence and even ichi falls under his teaching--giving up his blade for many months .  shushui's teachings are very similar to daoist teachings from china--non-violence and acceptance of life as it is  ( for good or for bad )  .    months after leaving this town and thinking all was well ,  ichi learns that as soon as he left ,  asagoro showed his true colors--enslaving women ,  oppressing the poor and being an all-around jerk .  in a way ,  ichi is responsible for this ,  as he helped asagoro and counted him as a friend .  now ,  asagoro has captured shushui and several innocent people have killed themselves due to the evil boss' actions .   when ichi returns ,  he doesn't accept automatically that asagoro is good or evil but tests him cleverly .  this bit with a scarecrow is inspired and leads to a finale where ,  what else ,  ichi kills the baddies and frees shushui .  this finale was very good and occurred in the rain .  then final scene with asagoro and the rocks is great ,  though the beheading is a tad cheesy by today's special effects standards .   pluses for the film are that although poorly paced ,  it is different and cannot be mistaken for the previous 15  ( which often seem very similar )  .  additionally ,  it does end very well .  minuses  ( aside from pacing )  are that some might dislike seeing ichi so fallible and the scenes with ichi and the other blind men that are included for comic relief fall flat .  .  . very ,  very ,  very flat .  they are tacky and unfunny .  .  . that's the sort of flat that it is . 
if this had been done earlier in the zatoichi series it could have been one of the best .  it is good enough ,  as most of them are ,  but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point .  the situation is unusually intriguing :  the farmers in the province have two champions ,  a benevolent boss  ( for once )  and a philosopher-samurai who starts a sort of grange ;  both run afoul of the usual local gangsters ,  who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances to snap up some land ;  their chief or powerful ally is a seeming puritan who is death on drinking and gambling but secretly indulges his own perverse appetites .   ( he also resembles dracula ,  as the villains in the later zatoichi movies tend increasingly to do .  )  these characters have enough meaning so that they deserved to be set against zatoichi as he was drawn originally ,  but by now he has lost many of his nuances ,  and the changes in some of the characters ,  such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man zatoichi has killed ,  need more time then the movie has to give ,  so that the story seems choppy ,  as if some scenes were missing .  other than that ,  the movie shows the virtues of most of the others in the series :  good acting ,  sometimes lyrical photography ,  the creation of a vivid ,  believable ,  and uniquely recognizable landscape  ( the absence of which is obvious in the occasional episode where the director just misses it )  ,  and a technical quality that of its nature disguises itself :  the imaginatively varied use of limited sets so their limitations seem not to exist .  and of course there is the keynote actor ,  whose presence ,  as much as his performance ,  makes it all work .  this must be one of the best-sustained series in movie history . 
an absorbing  ( although repetitive and rather didactic )  analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up ,  where the attempts to make yourself feel better by violating and putting down whoever is below you seems to be the only option .  but even here ,  in this desolate wasteland of lost dreams and no future ,  that does not work ,  and reaching out to something or someone to comfort and share with ,  a simple act of charity ,  gives some reward ,  even if it just makes the present bearable by reviving memories of the past .   although there is little actual on screen violence ,  this is a harsh and brutal film about the small mindedness of oppression  ( politically and personally )  that does not make for easy entertainment .  clearly based on a play ,  with a small cast ,  a broader more expansive relation to the general social and political environment would possibly have helped the film to reach a wider audience . 
the matador is a witty ,  dark humored and suspenseful melodrama that rises way above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and earnest performances from pierce brosnan ,  who has never ever been better than here ,  and the always reliable greg kinnear who has his best role here since playing jack nicholson's gay neighbor in as good as it gets .  a big plus goes to the writing as well .  clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by brosnan and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way .  the story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it's gonna go next .   nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music ,  clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you don't quite know how to label the film .  but that's also thanks to a very well written script which keeps the viewer  ( me anyway )  on the edge of his seat . 
it's always nice to see angela bassett getting to do a role that she can really sink her teeth into .  she is at times intense ,  funny and even sexy in her role as lena ,  a  " colored "  woman forced to make a home on a desolate mudbank just outside of cape town ,  south africa .  danny glover is also good in a not entirely sympathetic role as her partner ,  boesman .  willie jonah gives a finely nuanced performance as the stranger that discovers boesman and lena's new living area .  it's not often that you get a chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes .  although it is based on a play ,  the late director john berry  ( who also directed claudine )  opens the material up by having the film shot in the widescreen cinemascope format .  he also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things only mentioned in the play .  just like diahann carroll in claudine ,  john berry may have directed angela bassett into an academy award nomination .  this is definitely a film worth searching for . 
not to mention easily pierce brosnon's best performance .  of course greg kinnear is always great .  really ,  when has he really been bad ?  i think this film is incredibly underrated !  the use of colors in this movie is something very different in today's film world where every other movie has the payback blue filter .  i also love the way they used the song by asia .  proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctly .   i was making my first feature when this came out .  being that my film was a hit-man movie ,  i had to check out anything in the genre that was released .  after seeing it ,  i'm sure it had some effect on me through the process .  it was pretty cool when my film got on the imdb that it would recommend this film if you liked mine .  how any of the others relate i have no idea ,  making an even more interesting coincidence .   http : //www . imdb . com/title/tt1337580/
] haven't seen this film ?  haven't even heard of this film ?  it wouldn't surprise me .  one of the few truly  " independent "  films produced in the last ten years ,  no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution .  the independent company kino films ,  gave boesman and lena a very limited run with virtually no promotion ,  and the majority of major film critics didn't even bother reviewing it .  i guess a movie based on a one act ,  one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in today's market - and it's the intelligent film-lover's loss .   for the record ,  both angela bassett and danny glover deserved ocsar nominations  ( as did the cinematographer )  but the film received such little fanfare that i can't even blame the academy on that one .  this is a film that is challenging ,  thought-provoking ,  and heartbreaking ,  and it actually requires the audience to meet it on it's own terms .  taking that into consideration ,  it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment .  director john berry wisely does not attempt to dress-up athol fugard's play .  sure ,  we're given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots ,  but the film version of boesman and lena remains ,  on the whole ,  a story of two people living in inhumane conditions .   stripped of their basic human rights ,  boesman  ( glover )  and lena  ( bassett )  have no one left to attack but each other .  a third character joins them for awhile  ( willie jonah ,  amazing in a largely silent role )  ,  but the film's focus never strays from the title characters and what they've become .  bassett and glover give brave performances as the broken couple ,  performances that simply could not be improved upon .  vigorously and brutally stimulating ,  both intellectually and emotionally ,  boesman and lena deserves to be rediscovered of home video .  hands down ,  the best film of the year 2000 . 
i did not read anything about the film before i watched it ,  by chance ,  last saturday evening .  and then ,  as i was watching it ,  i felt the misery of lena and boesman into my bones .  i was so captivated by the acting and the tone and the filming that i listened only partially to the dialogues .  my husband fell asleep soon after we went to bed and i was sleepless ,  under the impact of the film .  i wanted to wake him up just to say :  " if i would ever vote for an oscar nomination ,  it would be for these two actors .  "  i decided to wait until the next day .  then i read more about the film on imdb ,  and was sad to learn that mr .  berry died before the release of the film and that he had probably never seen the last version of his brilliant masterpiece .  i still want to tell him that to me his film was a true independent film ,  in its concept and spirit .  the actors are to be praised not only for their brilliant performance but for accepting a part with no shine ,  no showing off ,  well to the contrary ,  displaying the true image of human depression .  sad but poignant . 
the acting in this movie was superb ,  but mixed with the truth about the condition of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching .  it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes ,  so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats ;  the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart .  worth seeing when you put the movie in it's proper context . 
i have always been a fan of the show so i'll admit that i am biased .  when the show's run ended ,  i felt like too many questions remained unanswered .  this movie to me felt like closure .  to see all the people i'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding .  i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect .  if that is so ,  this is the appropriate way to go out .  this movie is sometimes poignant ,  sometimes upsetting ,  but always satisfying .  if you are or ever have been a fan of the show ,  watch this movie . 
although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true to character ,  this was classic h : lots .  the characters ,  outside of mike giardello  ( giancarlo esposito )  ,  were true to form ,  and the reunion scenes of pembleton  ( andre braugher )  and bayliss  ( kyle secor )  were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen .    " homicide :  the movie "  aka  " life everlasting "  is a fan flick ,  but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series .  fontana ,  overmeyer and yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of  " the best damn show on television "  together for the series finale that nbc never bothered to give it .  true to  " homicide "  form ,  there were no happy endings ,  such is life .  that's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie-cutter cop shows left on television .  kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike .   ** i call myself a  " homicidal maniac "  if for no other reason than to keep my co-workers in a cooperative mood .  **
not only was this movie better than all the final season of h : lots .  but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever seen !   looking at the  " top 250 "  i see that only one small screen movie has made it :  how the grinch stole christmas .  i think it is time to increase that group to 2 .   i will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this ,  but i didn't mind .  i just loved being able to enter the world of the baltimore homicide squad again ! 
***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** well ,  seeing as i am a major h : lots fan ,  maybe i liked the movie more than normal people would .  however ,  this movie is still excellent .  it had tons of surprises ,  and it gave some more closure to the series .  while i was sad that bayliss turned into a murderer ,  the overall feeling i felt was satisfied . 
hlots was an outstanding series ,  its what nypd blue will never be ,  on hlots the plots are real ,  the dialog is real ,  the relationships are real .  with hlots back as a movie ,  tying up all the loose ends ,  it was good to have all the gang back together ,  even a few that passed away show up  ( wont say how )  the storyline was fast paced ,  emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out .  homicide  ,  life on the streets ,  network drama at its best !  !  !  !  5 stars !  !  !  !  thumbs up and all that .  thanks nbc for giving us the finally we didn't get ! 
for all the homicide junkies out there ,  this movie was great !  every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie .  it helped to resolve some  ( but not all )  issues from the series .  unfortunately ,  unless you actually did watch the series ,  most of the enjoyment would be lost ,  as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show's existence .  this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie ,  but we gotta take what we can get .  i hope they make more movies ,  and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order . 
this is the final episode we deserved .  at the end of the last season ,  things were left in a 'life goes on' mood ,  which was hardly the wrap-up that this realistic series deserved .  while not a happy show ,  this series was always one that made you think  ( a rare thing on television )  ,  and this is no exception .  'is death justified by reasoning ? ' 'are morals reflective of society ,  or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power ? ' 'what is a just death ,  and can it exist ? ' all of these questions ,  and more ,  are posed by the writers of this show every week ,  and this is their final thesis .  fine acting ,  great writing ,  wonderful camera-work ,  brilliant editing ,  clean direction .  if you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran ,  then get a hold on a copy somehow .  if you never watched the series when it ran ,  then this will stand up on its own ,  but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts .  for those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons ,  this is very satisfying viewing . 
for anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch .  however ,  it also leaves you wanting more .  i loved the way that every character  ( detective ) made an appearance .  least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie .  my guess is bayless of course .  this like the series was a very well put together series of scenes .  this is a series i wish had lived on .  thanks to the cast for some wonderful tv . 
the movie was excellent ,  save for some of the scenes with esposito .  i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series ,  and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series  ( thanks to nbc .  .  .  )  .  it was great to see pembleton and bayliss together at their most human ,  and most basic persons .  braugher and secor did a great job ,  but as usual will get overlooked .  it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide .  memories ,  tapes ,  and reruns on courttv just aren't the same as watching it come on every friday .  but the movie did its job and did it very well ,  presenting a great depiction of life after al retired ,  and the family relationship that existed between the unit .  i enjoyed this a lot . 
my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv-film .  does it work ?  yes .  gee runs for mayor and gets shot .  the homicide  " hall of fame "  turns up .  pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series .  a lot of flashbacks helps you who hasn´t seen the tv-series but it amuses the fans too .  the last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up .  and a short appearance from my favourite coroner juliana cox .  this is a good film . 
following a roughly 7 year rocky road on nbc ,  it was decided to do just one last super installment .  the series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block-buster of a tv hour .  it had always had a sizable ,  hard core of hard corps of followers .    it was almost as if the series with the full title of  " homicide :  life on the street "   ( 1993-99 )  was a sort of  " mr .  in-between "  of series .  it was too big to just cancel ,  but too small to get a case of 'rabid ratings ravings' over .    during the precarious tenure on friday evenings ,  they had presented some of the best and most daringly artistic of hourly dramas .  there ,  i've said it artistic ,  artistic !  !  but please ,  remember we mean artistic ,  but not just phony ,  pretentious ,  pedantic ,  politically correct preaching .   when at last ,  it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for  " homicide "  ;  this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for tv movie .    looking at all the past seasons' happenings and parade of regular characters ,  the production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off .   our story .  as we join the story ,  we find that baltimore homicide unit commanding officer ,  lt .  al giardello has  " pulled the pin "  ,  retired from the job ,  that is .  but 'g' isn't ready to really retire-retire yet .  so ,  instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod ,  we find that al is running for mayor of 'charm city . '  while out in the city ,  making some campaign stops and speeches ,  the former detective lieutenant takes an assassin's bullet .  alive ,  but in a comatose state ,  he is taken to the hospital .    news spreads quickly and as if officially summoned ,  we find all of the detectives of the baltimore unit we've seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance .  there is a great meeting of all of these former and present gumshoes as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a lead .   the producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story .  they managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to unrevealed ones .  the whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way .  but at least for now ,  we'll leave that as  " classified "  .   in wrapping up everything into a neat ,  little package ,  this tv movie surely gets our endorsement .  as for grading  " the homicide movie "  ,  we must give it an a or a+ ,  even .  but ,  no matter the grade here ,  it didn't score as high as a typical weekly episode . 
homicide :  the movie proved to be a good wrap-up to a well-written ,  well-directed ,  and well-acted series .  loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season .  the entire series ,  and especially the movie ,  provided a life-like look at life  ( and death )  in baltimore ,  a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate .  my attraction to the series began long before i moved to baltimore ,  but once i experienced life here for myself ,  i realized how realistic it was .  and the movie certainly retained that spirit .  i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series ,  but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city . 
what can i say ?  an excellent end to an excellent series !  it never quite got the exposure it deserved in asia ,  but by far ,  the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on televison .  ever !  the end of a great era .  sorry to see you go .  .  . 
in all truth ,  this really isn't a  " movie "  so much as an extended final episode ;  by this i mean that ,  had you not followed the tv series  ( homicide :  life on the street )  i suspect that you would have a hard time following this made-for-tv movie .  having said that ,   " homicide :  the movie "  is still a great watch .  i think it says a lot about a television production that every single cast member would return ,  many after years of absence ,  to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program .  the movie brings out that sense of  " family "  ,  not only amongst the characters ,  but amongst the actors ,  as well .  it's all very bitter-sweet knowing that this will be the last time we will see them all together again under the title of homicide .  story-wise ,  i found this film somewhat lacking .  giardello's mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived ,  and i felt his shooting could've been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position ,  as leiutenant .  also ,  det .  bayliss's extreme plot twist ,  which was left hanging at series end ,  is finally resolved ,  but i ,  for one ,  never felt that it needed to be ;  i enjoyed being left with a mystery  ( let us recall that the very first episode's first case also went unsolved for the entire series run !  )  .  as a devoted fan of the tv series i can love this movie ,  and the fact that it even got made after h : lots had been canceled ,  but i would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the slightest exposure to the series .  now ,  if they'd just release it on dvd .  .  . 
i have always been a huge fan of  " homicide :  life on the street "  so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up ,  i couldn't wait .   let me just say ,  i was not disappointed at all .  it was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television i've ever seen .  it was great to see everyone back again ,  but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre braugher back ,  because the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an all-together great show . 
a chance encounter between a salesman and a hit-man changes both their lives .  this is an odd film that works ,  an impressive effort for writer-director shepard .  in a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from james bond ,  brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit-man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job ,  but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope .  kinnear is equally good as the salesman ,  a decent fellow with a void in his life .  davis is fine as kinnear's flirtatious wife .  mainly a character study ,  the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable ,  an extremely dark comedy . 
i became a fan of the tv series `homicide :  life on the street' late in the show's run ,  but became a fan very quickly .  it was a cop show unlike any other :  visually different in its use of hand-held cameras ,  taking the viewer everywhere ,  with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities ,  and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department ,  including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface .    homicide :  the movie ,  the reunion follow-up to the series ,  is as good as a made-for-television film can be .  after lt .  giardello  ( yaphet kotto )  ,  now a candidate for mayor of baltimore ,  is shot ,  the series' cast members are back to help find the killer .  in addition ,  the cast members who left the force and those who died ,  also manage to have their place in the film .  the intensity and fire that marked the series return ,  and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series .  all in all ,  a terrific tv movie .   vote :  9
was'nt really bad for raw's first ppv of 006 .  but the ending was really really shocking to everyone in attendance & the ones who were watching at home .   first match- ric flair vs .  edge w/ lita for the wwe intercontinental championship not a bad opener ,  these two can seriously put on a great match if they had more time to put on a wrestling match .  flair wins by dq after edge slams him with his mitb briefcase .  3/10 second match- trish stratus vs .  mickie james for the wwe women's championship not bad noticing the fact that this is the first time these divas faced off in the ring together .  mickie goes for a modified chick kick ,  but trish ducks & nails her own chick kick for the win to retain her title .  3/10 third match- triple h vs .  big show seriously good this match was ,  really .  the whole match hhh focuses on big show's injured arm but big show still fights back .  later hhh is able to topple down big show & nails a pedigree for the win .  5/10 fourth match- shelton benjamin w/ mama vs .  viscera {this was a bonus match} not that bad ,  it was alright .  after viscera was down ,  behind the referee ,  benjamin's mama got a purse {which had bricks in it} & slammed viscera on the head with it three times .  viscera got up only to get caught with a spinning heel kick by benjamin for the win against the big man .  4/10  fifth match- jerry 'the king' lawler vs .  gregory helms boring ,  slow & sloppy .  both men didn't really put a very good effort .  jerry lawler wins after a fist drop for the win .  2/10  sixth match- torrie wilson vs .  victoria vs .  ashley vs .  maria vs .  candice michelle in a first ever women's gauntlet match it was pretty entertaining to me .  ashley {i think} eliminates candice last to win the first ever women's gauntlet match .  5/10 seventh match- john cena vs .  chris masters vs .  carlito vs .  shawn michaels vs .  kane vs .  kurt angle w/ daivari in an elimination chamber match for the wwe championship it was a cool elimination chamber match .  but nothing will top last year's elimination chamber which was the best .  the last three are masters ,  cena & carlito .  carlito turns his back on masters & gets a roll-up on him to eliminate him .  seconds later cena gets a roll-up on carlito for the three count to win the elimination chamber & retain his wwe title .  but his night was not over yet .  7/10 after the match ,  vince mcmahon comes out & congratulates cena for his victory .  vince mcmahon states that his night is not over yet ,  & says that edge cashes in his money in the bank opportunity to challenge cena for the title .  edge comes out with lita ,  gives the briefcase to vince & heads off in the ring as cena has one more match to go here tonight .   eight match- john cena vs .  edge w/ lita for the wwe championship {cena who is busted open during the chamber match} gets pounded straight away by edge ,  edge then nails a spear on cena ,  goes for the cover & to his shock cena breaks out .  edge nails another spear & covers for the shocking three count as he has beat cena & has won the wwe championship for the first time in his career .  1/10 so last year's new years revolution was better than this year's ,  but it was still alright .  the ec match was also good & the shocking of edge cashing in his mitb opportunity is definitely the most shockingest on the ppv show .   overall :  i'll give it 7/10 & a c
how i got into it :  when i started watching this series on cartoon network , i have to say that i've never seen anything like this , and it was the best .  but when i started collecting the series on vhs , and years later on dvd part of bandai's anime legends collections .  it was amazing , and truly worth watching .  it had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat .  and of course , the theme songs  " just communication "  , and rhythm emotions "  were the best .   characters , and gundams :  my favorite characters in the show were : heero , duo , relena , treize , lady und , noin , and zechs .  my favorite gundams in the show that i liked the most are the wing zero , and epyon , and of course the altron , and deathscythe i , and ii .   meaning of the show :  what this series also tells us that in real life , wars are very hard and we can sometimes win , or lose .  but peace can also be hard to obtain , and i do believe the gundam pilots are doing the right thing , and are trying to obtain world peace .   but however , this show is truly the best of the best .  so in closing to this review , after you watch this show , see the movie endless waltz . 
over-powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - check !  weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything - check !  mobile suits based on angels - check !   ok - its a gundam series .  this one ,  gundam wing ,  has good character development ,  real-world complexity ,  interesting ideas and some pretty eye-candy .   with characters ,  the initially weak relena dorlan  ( later peacecraft ,  then back to dorlan )  gets stronger and more independent  ( although is still absolutely besotted with heero yuy ,  the series main character )  .  the aforementioned heero ,  initially a cold ,  hard butcherer ,  becomes more and more human ,  while still remaining in-character .  and seeing the lost millardo peacecraft  ( whos nomm de guerre is zechs marquise )  float between oz ,  freelance ,  and command of white fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations .   the complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works .  however ,  in 49 half-hour episodes ,  it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity isn't used to its full potential .   the ideas at the core of the series - the necessity of fighting ,  the desire for peace ,  etc - are ones that resonate even today .  in retrospect ,  the series was ahead of its time ,  what with the  " war on terrorism "  and all .  but its exploration of these ideas ,  the monologues ,  especially those of treize kushrenada ,  is an incredible dramatic piece ,  forming some of the best writing in the series .   but that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor ,  which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge .   in terms of eye-candy ,  which is what this one has in bucketloads ,  everything from the mobile suits to the battleship libra  ( no not the tampons you idiot !  )  is wells designed ,  and explodes in big balls of orange  ( which is bad ,  because better animation would've had better explosions )  .  but who cares ?  !  stuff explodes ,  and thats all that matters .   in short though ,  the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes ,  you've missed out on a lot .  the poor writing can leave you cringing ,  and sometimes the animation makes you go  " wtf ?  !  ?  !  "  but this is made up for in its classic animation style ,  its scale ,  sparks of incredible dialogue ,  and its more mature exploration that one expects of such japenese animations . 
i could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in gundam wing ,  they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts .  instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss .   it contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months .  .  .  years ,  and then go back to and derive new meaning from ,  a masterpiece in script writing  ( even though it has the typical anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and english dub )  .  it has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views .   the relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series .  the relationship between heero and relena ,  and milliardo and noin are joys to watch .  the apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love  ( a word never mentioned in the series )  of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment .  the women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely ,  if at all see ,  which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic .  it takes heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring ,  but he gets there ,  and when he does ,  its a big pay off .    and then there's the giant robot fighting .  fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any hollywood epic fight scene .  any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids ,  as has become clear when i'm trying to recommend this series to my friends ,  but they're wrong .  many of the giant robot fights in gundam wing contain a hefty dose of pathos ,  usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete .   the constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes gundam wing impossible to be boring ,  it is a captivating ,  thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body . 
the second alternate gundam universe tale  ( g-gundam being the first )  ,  gundam wing is yet another different view into the gundam verse .  the familiar elements are found but gundam wing is actually different then its counterparts .  the biggest being the gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization .  in truth ,  the series doesn't really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict ,  the eve wars ,  don't happen until the later episodes .    the greatest positives of this series are it's characters .  all the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in .  another great plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series .  the designs put some of it's other gundam counterparts to shame .    one of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard uc fans claim rip off of the original uc saga .  why gundam wing gets this rap when the more apparent uc clone of gundam seed is out there is beyond me .  true there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well .   take for example ,  the usual comparison of zechs merquise and uc icon char aznable .  throughout the series ,  zechs is more the outcast in the alliance and in ways oz as well ,  while the red comet was shining symbol of zeon .  another big difference is the fact zechs loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other nickname he's given in the early episodes :   " killer of his own men .  "  char isn't given this label .    the problems with this series isn't the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems .  the first is the reused animation footage of the gundams attacks .  sure it's fun seeing heavy arms attack tanks ,  ms ,  and planes the first time .  but on it's fourth re-use scenes like this do get old .    the second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year .  if you really think about all the events springing in the series ,  a lot happens in just one lone year .    but i guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro's first lines every so often .  as it ranks ,  this is probably the best of the alternate universe gundam tales and a great introduction into the gundam world .  after all ,  this was the very first gundam anime to air in the us television . 
while being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the gundam wing series ,  upon re-watching the series ,  i have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated ,  but the plot ,  the gundam design ,  character design ,  and character depth are masterfully executed .  while at first appearing like a boy band of sorts ,  the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art ,  with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters .  consequently ,  it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character .  personally ,  i liked heero because of his stoic personality .  while i may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood ,  i can objectively say that gundam wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general  ( how can we obtain peace ?  )  while providing action packed battles in large robot suits ,  which ,  to say the least ,  is excellent . 
i've watched almost all of the gundam/mech anime that have showed in the us and this by far has the best story .  the way its plot twists and turns has u riveted .  gundam wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war .  the series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as gundams .  the gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful insurgency known as oz .  as things begin to heat up between oz and the gundam pilots ,  new political groups will form and old ones will dissipate .  old conflicts will end and new ones will arise .  to obtain peace the gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting .  but ,  how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal .  i recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot . 
gundam wing to me happens to be a good anime .  a bit slow moving  ( especially around the middle of the series )  ,  but over all enjoyable .  now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a  " winger "  ,  i will admit that i have watched all of the original gundam ,  gundam 0080 and 0083 ,  the 08th ms team ,  and gundam seed .   i will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be  " rip-offs "   ( i . e .  zechs marquise to the original gundam's char )  ,  but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series ,  as is seed .   if you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original gundam first ,  and then know that you are watching an au series . 
the matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it ,  it seems so light .  the humor is always medium-gauge ,  never unfunny but never gut-busting .  the story is a very simple thread .  the characteristics of the plot are often recycled features ,  namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straight-laced glass-wearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each other's lifestyles .  i also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary ,  as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself .  however ,  it really is a good film ,  because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time ,  it wasn't .  it has a subtle way of connecting with the audience .   i believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though it's a formula that is nothing new ,  even most of the humor ,  both main characters ,  virtually the only characters in it ,  are somehow met and gotten to know .  forget calling them real .  that's not at all what i mean .  what i mean is that though pierce brosnan's filthy ,  womanizing ,  boozing hit man is a detached comical character ,  he's grasped firmly by the writer and definitely by brosnan ,  who is aggressively communicating how much he enjoys his breath of fresh james bondless air .  greg kinnear's character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness ,  but he's given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the film's lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later .  we then realize the film is not simply analyze this or planes ,  trains and automobiles told stalely over again .  its truly saying something .   the film's climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists .  but with its lightness ,  how can that possibly be the focus of the film ,  though the plot has been leading up to it ?  no ,  the focus is what brosnan and kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other .  strangely ,  the matador is a film about regret and loneliness .  brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day ,  and though we don't understand why kinnear is so lenient and accepting with brosnan continually interrupting his life ,  it's slowly understood that brosnan is salvaging kinnear from a more down-to-earth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption .  the very last scene of the movie stays with me .  it ,  i think ,  is where the film's subtle side-stepping impact finally begins to seep . 
gundam wing is an amazing show from start to finish ,  every single episode is a joy to watch .  the story is typical gundam fare ,  in the future earth's populations grows to the extent where we create space colonies in order to expand .  the story though is set in an entirely different reality than any other gundam show .  it is the year after colony 195 and the corrupt earth government ,  known as the earth sphere alliance ,  is violently taking over the free colonies .  to combat the alliance control and the even greater threat that is to come  ( an evil militaristic organization hiding within the alliance known as oz ,  which later takes control of earth and the colonies )  ,  select members of the colonies send 5 super powerful mechs to earth to try and save the colonies from the threat that is to soon come .  these mechs ,  known as gundams ,  fight oz and try to regain peace in the colonies as oz takes the front-stage ,  completely eliminating the alliance and taking control of earth and its colonies .   gundam wing as i previously stated ,  is probably the most enjoyable gundam series to watch in my opinion .  a large part of this reason is the difference between this series and any other gundam series before it ,  but also the stories are far more deep and intricate than majority of the other gundam series .  gundam wing has more depth and emotion to it than any other gundam show i have ever seen thus far .  this particular series seemed to focus more on character and the relationships amongst those characters than epic space battle .  now don't get me wrong ,  this show still has many epic battles within it ,  and the show still maintains the epic atmosphere that other gundam series have ,  but it achieves this by having the story follow an ensemble cast of 6 or 7 characters as opposed to following just 1 .   no matter how you look at it this is truly one of the most unique and enjoyable gundam series out there ,  and i strongly recommend it to any fan of anime ,  or sci-fi in general .  the show sports some amazing animation and superb action ,  but the depth and intricacy of the story is what keeps you coming back for more .  the characters are so well drawn out by the end of the show that you end up loving each and every one of them .  this show is definitely one that shouldn't be missed .   a perfect 10/10 ! 
i'm not a big fan of most anime ,  but gundam wing is truly something else .  gundam wing lacks all of that stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime ,  since the number of jokes made over the 17 hours would only be in the double digits ,  gundam wing gets right down to business .    gundam wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series .  large parts focus on the diplomatic dealings of a war ,  not only the battles .  though battle animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would just be a pain to animate ,  individual duels between gundams are almost pieces of art considering the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements .    to my knowledge ,  this 49 episode plus one movie series was picked up by cartoon network in 2000 ,  and then professionally dubbed by them too .  the dubbing is simply flawless .  not only does every word said match up ,  but the voices use truly make the characters much more believable .  many believe that it is best to watch anime with subs in english ,  but i simply don't have the determination to do that .    not only are the voices good ,  but the score used over the series is quite impressive .  i'll just say it left me scouring the net in vain to find a soundtrack .    the plot of this series is what will truly hook viewers ,  and no ,  not hook you like some prime time drama like lost which was only made for the purpose of hooking you .  explaining the plot deeply would lead to many spoilers ,  since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes into the series .  the rough idea of the series is that earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty maintaining peace .  thus a war is started ,  leading to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations .  i feel that any more detail would begin to give away information ,  which is crucial to the plot .    i'll end here saying that this series is great for anyone that likes anime ,  anyone that thinks all anime is stupid  ( they have good reason to think so )  ,  and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it . 
gundam wing is a fun show .  i appreciate it for getting me into gundam and anime in general .  however ,  after watching its predecessors ,  such as mobile suit gundam ,  zeta gundam ,  and even g gundam ,  i find wing to be gundam lite .   characters :  an aspect long held by gundam is to have their characters thrust into difficulties and grow into maturity .  this does not happen in wing .  heero is top dog at the beginning ,  and he's top dog at the end .  personalities do not change ,  growth is never achieved .  the best character is zechs ,  who is for all intents and purposes a hero throughout most of the series .  but suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason .   mecha :  wing has great suit designs .  the gundams are super cool ,  with the epyon being my favorite .  i even consider a few of the oz suit designs to be on par with some of the classic zeon suits .  but sweet suit designs doesn't quite save the series from boring characters .   conclusion :  in the end ,  wing has cool fight scenes ,  though riddled with recycled animation ,  but shallow plot and character development .  enjoyable ,  but not moving like previous gundam outings . 
since the title is in english and imdb lists this show's primary language as english ,  i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing ( 2000 )  as presented in the bandai released dvd set .  my actual review for the whole series is under imdb's entry of  "  " shin kidô senki gundam w "  ( 1995 )  .   very little is changed in respect to plot ,  script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in .  purists can stick to japanese all they want ,  but for a more  " realistic "  experience i recommend the english track since all the characters ,  except heero yuy ,  are not japanese .  ( most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non-japanese asians .  )  for one thing ,  the characters' personalities come across more  " directly "  than in the japanese version .  the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give-or-take performances but a very well cast group of actors .   wing gundam's pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity .  voiced by mark hildreth who's deadpan delivery can be criticized as  " bad acting "  but it matches heero's personality very well .   deathscythe gundam's duo maxwell ,  ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends .  he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show ,  masterfully played by scott mcneil .  he may sound a little too old for his age ,  but duo's english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one .   trowa ,  the pilot of heavyarms ,  is a lost lonely soul who's only purpose so far has been combat ;  despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him ,  he only knows how to kill ,  not to befriend .  kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton .   quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand .  a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl ( and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version )  but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy .   the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over-the-top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa .   relena darlian sounds older in english ,  voiced by lisa ann bailey .  this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story ,  her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development .   zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version .  both voices bring out different sides to the same character .  his japanese voice is haughty ,  authoritative and commands respect  ,  keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature .  his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued ,  sounding more devious and  " snake-like "  ,  highlighting zechs' secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals .   the members of oz are a mixed bag really .  treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to his larger-than-life japanese style of speaking .  however ,  lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . bored most of the time .  the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either .   i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds .  the maganac corp's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents .  the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility .   despite underwhelming acting from the side characters ,  the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over-the-top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing's script .  very faithful to the original japanese script ,  keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics ,  war and human nature .  sadly ,  it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script . 
i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes ,  i still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow ,  yet thoughtful actions of the story-telling .  i am still a fan .  .  .  .  . with some minor pains .   though this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had-a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything ( sound familiar ?  )  ,  i have to say that this one gets a bit too mellow-dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to belly-ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from succeeding in their plans ( especially the character called wufei .  .  . i mean he whines more than an american character on a soap opera .  get a counselor , will ya ?  )   besides for the over-exaggerated drama ( i think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors )  ,  this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again .  i mean it can always be worse .  it could be like the recent installment ,  seed .  .  .  .  .  . eeeewwww ,  talk about mellow-dramatic .  .  .  . i'll chat about that one later . 
mobile suit gundam wing is the fourth series in the continuing gundam chronicles .  unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars ,  this one is a little different ;  instead of having an army-vs . -army situation ,  this one is led by five teenage boys  ( due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults )  and their machines called  " gundams "  because of the metal alloy used in their construction .  which leads to problems ,  since gundams are supposed to be destroyed ,  replaced by  " mobile suits "  ,  which are piloted less-destructive weapon platforms and  " dolls "  which are ran on a . i .  and are used as grunt infantry .   the whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the anime that makes it's way here .  especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines ,  such as naruto ,  dragonball ,  one piece ,  dragonball z and inuyasha which are all from shonen jump ,  which is now available in america .   mobile suit gundam wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of over-the-top battles between mortals who more resemble gods ,  gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully .  normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a  " small "  battle is to have it take a half-hour - something that would never happen in real life .  gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die ,  machines will be destroyed and rebuilt ,  battles will be lost and won ,  and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satirical .   but the magic of gundam wing is in the details ,  and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having .  emotion .  instead of mythic prophecies ,  magic ,  or overblown martial arts ,  gundam wing is hard-line science fiction from a country that hates hard-line science fiction .   ( note :  the author would like to state that neon genesis evangelion is not hard-line-plausible-in-real-life science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series )  they love star wars ,  but hate a . i .   ( the movie )  .  henceforth why gundam wing was and gundam seed is now in production for both japanese and u . s .  releases at the same time with two voice teams .  american audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed episodes that air on cartoon network .   the emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards .  the heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of mobile suit gundam wing .  this is not war ,  this is  " total war "  .  every person ,  every building ,  every street is a target for attack ,  both on earth and off .   my only complaint ,  and the reason it didn't get the score of ten ,  is that at about three-fourths of the way through ,  it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes ,  and no one really seems to change .  kind of like a present-time flashback ,  which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters ,  but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between project :  meteor and oz .  but the final two episodes and the overplayed-on-cartoon-network  ( back in 2001-2003 )  mobile suit gundam wing :  endless waltz movie more than make up for the slack .

the booth puts a whole new twist on your typical j-horror movie .  this movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story .  the director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks .   the story is about perception of the people who works ,  lives ,  and loves of our protagonist ,  and how he perceives the people who surrounds him in an antiquated radio station dj booth .  the story peels back the layers of the main character like an onion in flash-backs as the movie runs its course ,  and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems .  the movie mostly took place in a small ,  out-dated radio station's studio with a very bad history ,  where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re-locating .  it is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid .  at time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co-workers or it was all in his mind .  what i like about this film is that the film-makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did .  this movie is a very smart ,  abide rather short 76 minutes film . 
like talk radio ,  the booth is actually kinda predictable  ( talk radio because we know the truth of what happened going in ,  the booth because of- let's face it- the genre and the basic set-up )  .  that's not necessarily a bad thing ,  in this case .  it means ,  in essence ,  that the filmmakers don't punk out in the end the way they might've in ,  say ,  an american version of this story .  the booth moves inexorably toward its  ( foregone )  conclusion ,  but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of  ( very scenic )  road .  it reminds me of harlan ellison's spooky short story ,  flop sweat .  the claustrophobia is ,  at times ,  almost palpable .  worth a nice long look . 
i liked this movie because it basically did more with less .  it could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more  ( though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop )  .   the guy playing the dj did a good job of showing someone spooked out and haunted by his memories .  i also found his dialog with the callers pretty funny .   while parts of the movie you can see coming a mile away ,  other parts you do not expect to turn out the way they did .   i thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part ,  concentrating more on the living side of the equation .  the last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done as everything is being revealed .   while it was a shorter movie ,  it felt to be just about the right amount of time to tell the story .  any more and it would have started to drag . 
two years ago i watched  " the matador "  in cinema and i loved everything about this movie .  obviously ,  i was totally under impression of pierce brosan's magnificent role .  yesterday ,  i caught this movie again on tv so i looked at it a bit deeper .  now ,  i can say with certain that this movie isn't that special but you just gotta' love it because of one man .    brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of julian noble ,  tired hit-man who has no friends .  soon julian meets danny wright  ( greg kinnear )  in mexico city ,  man who's got bad luck :  his son died in accident ,  his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that he can keep his wife bean  ( hope davis )  .   i always liked movies like this ;  crime movie with big touch of humor .  mostly that humor comes from brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d .  .  .  .  or one of my favorite lines in this movie :   " i look like a bangkok hooker on a sunday morning ,  after the navy's left town .  "  brosnan says it with his charm while he's drinking his margarita as usually .  i also like greg 'typical american face' kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like danny wright .   so i recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of brosnan ever .  he'll make you smile and admire him at the same time .  great brosnan in not equally great movie . 
a surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia .  there's a lot going on in this for having a run time of only 74 minutes ,  but it works .  the scares are very subtle ,  not the jump-cut scares that seem to populate most recent asian horror films .  the way the  " scares "  are set up is similar to the disturbing moments in  " the uninvited "   ( aka 4 inyong shiktak ,  directed by su-leon lee )  ,  but this isn't nearly to the same caliber .  the film does a nice job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological .  it's not perfect ,  but it does what it's supposed to do .  i would recommend checking it out if you get a chance . 
i generally love these 1930 mystery/police charlie chan type of movies ,  and this is no exception .  however ,  something seems bad with this movie .  a late attempt to switch from cerebral moto movies centered around the plot contrivances to a salad bar spoilt by comedy relief that is as relieving as sore feet .  a typecast buffoon appears from nowhere impersonating a clumsy englishman who plays the detective ,  and even other characters seem entangled into providing comedy relief .  the plot may seem odd or a bare excuse to us today ,  but back then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real ,  but a commonplace occurrence . 
a team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure  the crown of the queen of sheeba .  from egypt ,  the crown is to be transferred via steamship to san francisco .  but it won't be an easy journey .  there are plenty of would-be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown .  fortunately for all involved ,  mr .  moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey .  however ,  that doesn't mean someone won't try to get their hands on the treasure .   after the disappointment of mr .  moto's gamble ,  i went into mr .  moto takes a vacation hoping for the best ,  but ,  admittedly ,  fearing the worst .  but within the first 10 seconds of the film ,  i knew i would find it more enjoyable .  i'm a sucker for a 1930s style mystery that features anything to do with archaeological digs in egypt .  and seeing moto disguised as a german archaeologist  ( imagine that ,  peter lorre playing a german ?  )  ,  the beginning scenes really drew me in .  while the movie may have quickly shifted to the less exotic san francisco ,  it remained just as enjoyable .  dark ,  sinister characters lurking in the rainy night ;  gunshots fired from open windows that narrowly miss the hero's head ;  sophisticated and supposed foolproof alarm systems just begging for someone to test them ;  and master criminals believed to be dead  these are the kind of elements found in a lot of the really good 1930s mysteries that i love .  and mr .  moto takes a vacation's got 'em all .  a couple other bonuses for me included the always enjoyable lionel atwill in a nice little role ,  comic relief from g . p .  huntley that's actually funny ,  and a return to form for mr .  moto .  i've already mentioned his disguise in the movie's opening scenes ,  well the athletic moto comes out near the film's finale .  moto is a like a whirling dervish of activity as he goes after his prey .  all this and i haven't even mentioned the wonderful performance turned in by lorre .  any way you look at it ,  mr .  moto takes a vacation is a winner .   as much as i hate that the mr .  moto series had to end after this installment ,  it's understandable when you think about it .  wwii was just around the corner .  and after pearl harbor ,  a movie with a japanese hero wouldn't have gone over very well .  at least the mr .  moto series ended on a very positive note . 
this is one of my favorite mr .  motos ,  and i have seen them all .  as usual lorre is his charming self as the debonair mr .  moto .  lionel atwill plays a delightfully zany museum curator ,  the usual comic relief is quite funny here ,  and there are lots of suspects on whom to cast an eye .  it's fast paced and fun .   the archaeologist doesn't have quite the same flair as thomas beck ,  the usual second lead in these programmers ,  but he's adequate .  stepin fetchit is on board ,  and while he speaks in a stereotypical manner his lines are funny ,  not demeaning to his intelligence ,  and he actually saves the day in his brief time on screen . 
i totally disagree . i thought that this was a great movie for kids . dawn wells from gilligans island , and promise shown of a barely then known dana plato . it was disneylike and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless fluff . no it wasn't scary and wasn't meant to be . i wont ruin the ending . but it was unusual the way that it was done . i mean the kids characters were great and i didn't know what to expect in the end . the basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initially . it also helps them out of a jam towards the end . it also has the plus of not being overly long . i think it clocks in at under 95 minutes
this charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful  " the legend of boggy creek "  is a follow-up in name only .  stories abound in a sleepy ,  self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious bigfoot creature called  " big bay ty "  that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of boggy creek .  two bratty brothers and their older ,  more sensible tomboy sister  ( a sweetly feisty performance by cute ,  pigtailed future  " different strokes "  sitcom star dana plato )  go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being .  the trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry ,  bear-like ,  humongous ,  but very gentle and benevolent sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue .   tom moore's casual ,  no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace ,  astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail ,  drawing the assorted country characters with great warmth and affection ,  and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic ,  restrained ,  unforced manner that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush .  the adorable dawn wells  ( mary ann on  " gilligan's island "  )  gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids' loving working class single mom while jim wilson and john hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots .  robert bethard's capable ,  sunny cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously tranquil ,  achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor .  darrell deck's score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo-pluckin' country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew .  in addition ,  this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90's kiddie feature bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance . 
i saw this movie when i was 13 and i really liked dana plato who later starred in different strokes as kimberly drummond  .  i don't think it's garbage  . it was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either  .  its just a cute kids movie about 3 children who go after men trying to find the boggy creek monster  .  the men get hurt and the kids rescue them with the help of the creature  . haunting shots of the arkansas swamp and scenery were neat  .  this is a good movie for kids  , no real violence a few mild scares but good fun for the young kids . 
this is a fantasy movie for kids based on the boggy creek legend although i don't know why they called it return to boggy creek as if it's a sequel . this movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare .  dawn wells stars as the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around boggy creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid .  yes it's very silly and the plot is corny but this kind of movie is perfect for the 8-12 y/o group which it targeted .  it's harmless g-rated kiddie fare and at least you don't have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it .  strictly for the 8-12 y/o set  , older kids will get bored and think it lame . 
*** spoilers*  my dad had taped this movie for me when i was 3 .  by age 5 ,  i had watched it over 400 times .  i just watched it and watched it .  and i still do today !  it has a grim storyline ,  a lamb's mother is killed by a wolf--a very emotional scene--and wants to become a wolf ,  like him .  after years of training ,  the lamb is made into a really really evil looking thing .  he and the wolf travel to his old barn ,  but he cannot kill the lambs ,  no matter how much he wishes to .  he ends up killing the wolf ,  but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends ,  and can't return to his previous way of life .   the art is beautiful ,  the songs are .  . well ,  okay ,  and the voice acting is better than some things today .   all in all ,  you just *have* to see this movie ,  it is a great masterpiece .  although ,  it's very hard to find today .   
in a not so conventional sense of the word .   this movie was one of my favorites as a young child ,  and i just recently remembered it ,  and thought to look it up .  while many of the details are no longer clear in my mind ,  the overall feeling that the movie gave me has stuck with me over the years .   if parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent themes ,  then i highly recommend this movie .  it taught me a lot about life and death ,  and brought forth in me a lot of emotion .  to this day ,  it remains one of my favorite films . 
julian noble  ( pierce brosnan )  is a hit-man .  or a  " facilitator of fatalities "  ,  as he prefers to be called .  he is also a drunk ,  a womaniser ,  and in the middle of a mid-life crisis .  on a job in mexico city ,  he bumps into danny white  ( greg kinnear )  ,  an unconfident businessman who thinks he's just nailed a recent pitch ,  but is unsure .  they meet in the hotel bar late one night ,  after they've both had a few too many margaritas .   sounds like the set-up for a by-the-numbers comedy thriller ,  doesn't it ?  but it isn't .  instead ,  the matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study .  it avoids every twist that the above summary would suggest ,  sometimes even setting them up just to gleefully tear them down .  it is a film that respects it characters enough to just let them get on with it ,  without feeling the need to shove them into needless plot contrivances .   brosnan's hit-man will inevitably be compared to his bond ,  but this is unfair to both performances .  bond is a half-formed idea ,  a product of all that has gone before ;  while julian is a fully-formed character with his own motivations and flaws .  he has existed in his own shadowy ,  seedy world for so long that he has forgotten how to talk to another human being .   when he meets danny in the hotel bar ,  he sees his opposite :  a normal guy with a normal job and normal problems .  he envies danny ;  the hit-man has become fed up with his life ,  sees himself edging ever closer to his inevitable  " burn out "  ,  as he puts it .  but when danny opens up about the death of his only son ,  julian tries to change the subject with a dirty joke .  he is a man who has ,  in his own words ,  been  " running from any emotion .  "  kinnear holds his own opposite brosnan's performance ,  and injects danny white with his effortless everyman charm .  he is the perfect foil to julian ;  while the latter is drunken bravado and hedonism ,  danny is down to earth ,  with just a hint of eccentricity .  but he too goes deeper than his established persona ,  showing us how far the everyman will go when faced with financial and familial ruin .   there is real chemistry between brosnan and kinnear .  it is most visible in the film's three key scenes :  the hotel bar ;  a bullfight ,  during which julian tells danny what he does for a living ,  and takes him through a dress rehearsal of an assassination ;  and a scene in which julian turns up at danny's house six months later .  this scene also introduces us properly to danny's wife ,  bean  ( yes ,  bean )  .  in another example of how much the matador respects its characters ,  bean  ( hope davis )  ,  instead of panicking at the presence of a hired killer in her house ,  merely asks with forced calm ,   " did you bring your gun ?  "  the script isn't quite as good as could have been after maybe another rewrite .  one or two lines seem a little forced ,  and a couple of the jokes need a little more work .  but in the scenes where julian and danny  ( and later bean )  just talk ,  the writing is superb .  the film feels no need to put the characters in any outlandish situations  ( other than meeting a hit-man ,  and said hit-man turning up on your doorstep )  .  it just lets them talk ,  gently nudging them toward necessary plot points .   there is action ,  but only when it reflects on the characters .  one notable instance is when julian botches a job in budapest because he keeps seeing himself through his rifles scope .  the rest of the film is about the characters ,  how they interact ,  how they each affect one another .  and ,  ultimately ,  it is about friendship ,  even in the most unlikely of places .  at one point julian tells danny that he is his only friend .  and he really means it . 
i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart !  no other story had such a unfinished ending .  .  .  i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites ,  because it was so unusual - a story about unfairness ,  and cruelty ,  and loneliness ,  and life ,  and choices that can't be undone ,  and the need for others .  chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother ,  but the wolf is alone ,  too ,  when chirin follows him into the mountain .  the wolf doesn't kill the lamb ,  even though each night he says  " maybe i'll eat you tomorrow .  "  the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use .  i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child .  stories like this ,  with this depth and feeling ,  and this intricacy of meaning ,  are very rare .  it is a sad story ,  but i've never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made .  i am glad i have seen this movie ,  and i'm glad i saw it as a child . 
watching this several times as a child was quite the experience 15 years ago ,  and now that i've found it again it still has a film experience like few others .  if risky ,  it's a great display of morals and life lessons recommended for family viewing with young kids .  while it still holds up as an adult ,  i was fortunate to have learned from it many times over years ago .  trying to find it today is hard enough  .   .   .  but believe me it is well worth it no matter what the age .  anime fans especially will find this a great entry to masami hata's filmography .  with impressive art work and unique designs ,   " chirin no suzu "  represents a worthwhile experience .  while some of the lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in english ,  the musical score is nevertheless captivating .  but even the voice acting is far better than much released today .  unfortunately is went out of print in the mid-1980s from rca columbia home video ,  and has not received any new format release to my knowledge ,  at least in the us .  look hard for it and you will be quite satisfied !  it's an artful ,  intense ,  enjoyable ,  and important landmark in japanese animation . 
thanks to warner archive ,  i can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink .   ( the bathtub ,  however is present .  )  this film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to warners at the time .  if some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some ,  it is because they were big in the silent days ,  and most faded with the popularity of the talkies .  there are some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well .  you will be most impressed with winnie lightner ,  who performs two numbers .  also there is that french star ,  irene bordoni who croons a love song in a sexy manner .  perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two-strip technicolor  " chinese fantasy ,  "  which has been restored for this version .  it is truly beautiful and it stars myrna loy and nick lucas .  finally ,  there is the massive  " lady luck "  finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour .  this is truly an epic of the early-talkie era .  any old-movie buff will love this . 
it is very hard to rate this film .  as entertainment value for 21st century viewers ,  it fails miserably .  however ,  for the student of early sound films and history ,  it is a jewel .   " show of shows "  was a revue filmed to compete with mgm's successful  " hollywood revue of 1929 "  ,  which still survives intact complete with its technicolor scenes .   the purpose of the all-star revue was to showcase a particular studio's silent stars in speaking roles ,  and show that they could make the transition .  however ,  warner bros .  seems to have forgotten this and employs many acts and stars that they didn't even have under long-term contract such as ben turpin ,  lloyd hamilton ,  beatrice lillie ,  and even a marching band .  meanwhile ,  their biggest talent - al jolson - is noticeably absent .  even at a high salary he could not be compelled to join in .  almost every act is overly long and the film plays like a dozen or so vitaphone shorts strung together with no continuity .  the finale is also overly long ,  but it is really enjoyable with all of its dance numbers .   the highlights of the film are two numbers from winnie lightner -  " pingo pongo "  and  " singin in the bathtub "  ,  a couple of numbers with nick lucas ,  john barrymore performing shakespeare ,  and the chinese fantasy  " li po li "  with nick lucas and myrna loy .  this last number is the only part of the film that survives in technicolor ,  and it really is quite attractive .  reasonably enough ,  the players in these good acts were long-term warner bros .  stars so perhaps the director knew how to play to their strengths since he was familiar with them .   this film acts as a snapshot at an odd point in film history - the year 1929 ,  which was the bridge year between two eras - the silent and sound eras ,  and the roaring 20's and the great depression .  just two years later this same film would have had an entirely different cast ,  as warner bros .  would abandon its silent era stars and the stars they hired just to produce the early musicals in favor of those stars that gave warner bros .  its distinctive urban look and feel - james cagney ,  joan blondell ,  edward g .  robinson ,  and others . 
this is a deliriously colossal vulgar silly all star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that warner bros could afford .   .  .  . and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late 20s ,  an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring twenties' exuberance and youthfulness put to song and dance .  the show of shows is pretty gigantic .  vaudeville act after soliloquy after tap dance after acrobat after comedian after fan-dance after ukulele lunacy after rin tin tin who introduces 'an oriental number' .  .  .  (  !  )  .  .  .  and on and on it lumbers ,  grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality vitaphone sound .  it is far too long ,  but among it's delirious delights are the awesome  " singin in the bathtub "  number created on a scale of which the qe2 architects would be proud .  .  . beatrice lillie lounging by a grand piano with some happiness boys amusingly warbling a witty ditty ,  nick lucas ,  and the never-ending grand finale in two color color .  .  . which is all set to the song lady luck .   .  so keen are the tubby chorus line and leaping teenagers to en-ter-tain us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort .  row after row of  " doll "  characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor .  i kid you not ,  there are even girls strapped to the crystal chandeliers ,  mummified with shiny gauze and chained up with pearl ropes ,  unable to move  ( for days ,  i imagine ,  during production )  whilst this katzenjammer of toy-box athleticism twitch and spasm below to the ukulele orchestra .  of course i loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to horrify and terrify them each separately and to roll about on the lounge in shrieking in delight at each and every exclamation of their startled reactions .  and so should you .  .  . and rejoice that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill .  it is all so demented . 
it is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary .  at times there is almost a desperation ,  as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound ,  surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside  ( as did happen to some )  ,  rin-tin-tin .  however ,  was pertfectly natural .  in such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences ,  some were sure to stand out john barrymore's soliloquy from richard ii is a moment certainly worth preserving .  by and large ,  only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence .  however ,  this is over all reasonably entertaining ,  and a must for  " film buffs "  especially interested in the silent to sound transition
this is hardly a movie at all ,  but rather a real vaudeville show ,  filmed for the most part  " in proscenium "  ,  and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day .   " singing in the bathtub "  is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen-- be sure to wear your shower cap ! 
gung ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time .  the result is uneven ,  but generally entertaining .  keaton balances all three aspects of his lead character quite well .  wantabedde is even better .  one warning :  george wendt is very poor in his supporting role .  otherwise ,  this is quite enjoyable time capsule . 
i really enjoyed this movie .  typically ron howard who seems to like being associated with michael keaton .  love the scene when hunt travels to japan with his sales pitch .  whoa ,  how did that get in there  !  cheap laughs but great value
i remember watching  " gung ho "  as a child with my mother ,  and wondered why she would always cry in the last few minutes .  i ,  of course ,  found the entire movie hilarious ,  particularly the mannerisms of the characters .  it wasn't until i was much older and watched it again that i realized how much deeper this show actually is .   michael keaton and gedde watanabe shine in their roles as the reluctant mediators .  keaton ceases to amaze me with his real-life style of line delivery ,  and watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix .  i also thought that patti yasutake  ( umeki )  was simply fabulous in her role as the comic relief .   i think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the 80s .  we can all learn a lesson from the merging of the american and japanese workers in this film .  .  . sometimes you really *can* have  " the best of both worlds .  "  and now i understand why my mother felt the way she did in those closing moments .  i'd rather have one of those cars ,  too . 
i just have to throw my two cents in .  relax ,  it's a comedy .  yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted .  i can't think of many comedies where they aren't .  this isn't a new release ,  it's out on video and airs on cable almost every week .  would i see it in a theater ?  sure ,  i did ,  when it first came out .  it's funny .  .  . that should be enough .   even if i didn't like it at all i'd still watch it on cable for michael keaton .  he's an underrated and under-appreciated actor .  i can't think of another who is so capable in every genre .  nor can i think of one who's as successful .  a comedic actor who's also an action star ( short lived but still )  ,  who's also a romantic lead ,  who's also a dramatic actor ;  a villain and a hero .  i can't think of any ,  at least not in hollywood .  certainly none who have been successful at all those genres .  i mean there's tom cruise but to me he's better at being tom cruise than becoming a character .  however this isn't about michael keaton vs .  tom cruise so i'll move on .   gung ho is worth renting ,  heck it's worth buying since you can probably find it for $10 . 00 or less at stores like wal-mart .  it's worth watching on cable ( if you have cable or satellite )  .  it's one of those fun to watch movies .  you can put your brain on pause ,  and just relax ,  and chuckle away .   to ask for more ,  in my honest opinion ,  is asking too much . 
the turning point in  " the matador "  comes about half through the movie when danny ,  an unsophisticated man from denver ,  is sitting in the balcony of his mexico city hotel ,  enjoying a quiet moment .  someone knocks on his door ,  and knowing it's julian ,  the paid assassin ,  he refuses to answer .  but did he really ?    richard shephard ,  the director of  " the matador "  ,  presents us with a character ,  julian noble ,  who shows no redeemable qualities .  in fact ,  we have already seen him in action ,  doing what he does best .  when julian meets danny at the bar of the camino real in mexico city ,  he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living .   danny ,  who has come to sell his program to a mexican company ,  but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract .  danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter julian .  it's not until some time later ,  on a cold winter night that the killer appears at danny's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to tucson .  it's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way .   pierce brosnan ,  acting against type ,  makes a great contribution with his irreverent julian noble .  just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character .  greg kinnear ,  on the other hand ,  plays the straight part of this odd couple .  hope davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didn't she stay longer .  philip baker hall puts an appearance as the liaison between julian and his assignments .   richard shephard directs with style working with his own material .  the musical score is by rolfe kent and the crisp cinematography of david tattersall enhances everything . 
i teach japanese for an online high school and i include cultural activities so that the students can learn about the country as well as the language .  and watching  " gung ho "  is one of the requirements .  the students can either buy or rent the movie .  stereotypes or not ,  this helps the students to see that other people view the world and their lives differently than we do .  many of my students have told me that they enjoyed the movie so much ,  they are going to get a copy for themselves .  it is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture .  i just wish i could get a cleaned-up tv version .  i'm not really into the crude language the auto workers use all the time . 
i recently saw this movie in my international business class .  i was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary  ( not to say i don't love documentary i've just hard bad luck with movies in that class )  imagine my surprise when this movie ,  that's actually a movie ,  came up .    this film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere .  the culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call .  i would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh ,  because yes it is funny .    well ,  that's about it !  cheers
i saw this movie when it was new .  later i rented it in japan after having been here three years ,  afraid that i would cringe when i viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience .  the movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between japan and pennsylvania  ( where i'm from )  .  not all the stuff is factually spot on ,  but the tone is perfect .   i'm still in japan many years later ,  and i continue to enjoy this film for its even-handed treatment of the two sides in the story .  interestingly ,  although the japanese-american actors spoke japanese in the original ,  the dialog is redubbed in the japan version to cover up obvious second-language delivery problems .   i noticed one reviewer uses this in a japanese class .  i think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with japan by watching this film than by reading any of the  " serious "  books on the matter  ( most of which were written in the 80s and financed by propagandizing japanese companies )  .   don't be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one-star reviewers who ,  among other things ,  found it implausible that the japanese would want to build cars in the us .   ( of course ,  the japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction .  )  this is a very warm and funny movie that i would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clichés ,  like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music .  michael keaton has never been funnier . 
gung ho is one of those movies that i never get tired of watching .  michael keaton has always been a favorite of mine ,  & he is absolutely hilarious in this movie .  matching him step for step is gedde watanabe .  the two of them work wonderfully together .  although this movie is a comedy ,  i also like how it shows hunt  ( keaton )  & kazihiro  ( watanabe )  struggling in their roles as the leaders of their respective groups .  they both try so hard to keep the peace ,  & then they finally get into a fight  ( which is hysterical to watch )  .  first ,  they're both on the floor .  then hunt jumps on a chair .  kazihiro jumps on the desk .  hunt jumps on the desk with him .  the fight then spills out from the office into the factory .  i love that after they are separated by the workers ,  you can tell that they both feel bad for letting things get so out of hand .  also ,  there is a scene where you can see the influence that hunt has had on kazihiro .  he is at his house & his boss from japan arrives & says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow :    kazihiro :  tomorrow not good day .  sakamoto :  why not ?  kazihiro :  factory is locked & we can't find key .   tell me you can't picture michael keaton saying something like that !   i guess i really like this movie because it is genuinely funny ,  & also shows how people that are radically different can not only learn from each other ,  but become good friends as well . 
this is a great film !  !  !   i first saw this film when it came out .  i just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it .  a lot of films we watched when we were younger don't seem to hold up when we watch them later in life .  the film is actually a great 80's example of the type of films made then .  keaton is at his best ,  all the actors actually did a very good job and ron howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it .  the pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80's is too funny .  being from the 80's i loved seeing the ugly pacer again .  the film is a great film for any comedy lovers and 80's film lovers . 
i saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class .  were to mainly comment on the different management styles and ideas on quality ( of the product )  .  i did rent this one back in the eighties and i remember it to be good ( but not great ) movie .  i've always liked michael keaton's style and delivery .  he was a perfect fit for the movie .   i am surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie .  i grant you yes it's no oscar winner but it does have decent comedic value .  it's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all-out comedy farce .  i also find some of those that felt this was an inaccurate film on cultural and business differences .  i beg to differ .  i grant you again that there are a lot of generalities and dramatizations but then again this is hollywood film not a documentary .  from what i've read about differences between automakers on both sides of the pacific at that time many of the principle ideas were accurate for the time .   some of the basic differences were that japanese workers made to feel as part of the company as a whole .  teamwork was emphasized .  they perhaps made the company above all else .  where american workers had more of a management verses labor type of relationship .  the individual was more important than the company .  i'll probably get some hate email over that comment i'm sure .   another difference was how quality was viewed and whose responsibility it was to fix .  in many japanese plants defects or problems are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered .  rather as one character in the movie put it  " it was the dealers ( meaning car dealer )  problem "  .   many of these things are probably dated but i'm sure some are still around as many us car makers are still struggling to keep up with the japanese .  if one is more interested in the subject of american ,  european and japanese automakers i can recommend a book that studies this subject in more detail and was done around the same time period .  the book is called  " the machine that changed the world "  by james womack ,  daniel jones and daniel roos .  it's about a study of automakers during and before the time period that this movie covers .  parts are bit dry but i think you'll find that it backs up much the movie also . 
way ,  way back in the 1980s ,  long before nafta was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities ,  the united states and japan were at each other's throat in the world manufacturing race .  remember sayings like 'union yes !  , ' 'the japanese are taking this country over , ' and 'americans are lazy ? '  as the reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace ,  director ron howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash 'gung ho , ' which drew over $36 million in u . s .  box office receipts .  while in many ways dated ,  howard's tongue-in-cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today .   'gung ho' focuses on hunt stevenson  ( michael keaton )  ,  the automakers union rep from hadleyville ,  a small ,  depressed town in the foothills of pennsylvania .  stevenson has been asked to visit the assan motor company in tokyo  ( similar to real-life toyota )  ,  which is considering a u . s .  operation at the town's empty plant .  with hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse ,  assan decides to move in and stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line .   the 112 minutes of 'gung ho' is a humorous look at these two sides ,  with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered :  on one hand ,  an american workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism ;  on the other hand ,  japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self-worth .  in stevenson ,  we find an american working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings .  with the survival of his workers' jobs and most of hadleyville on the line ,  stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance ,  although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble .  besides answering to the heads of assan ,  we witness a delicate balancing act between stevenson and his fellow union members ,  many of whom he grew up with .  this includes buster  ( george wendt )  ,  willie  ( john turturro )  ,  and paul  ( clint howard ,  ron's brother )  .   the japanese cast is headed by gedde watanabe ,  also known for 'sixteen candles' and 'volunteers . ' watanabe plays kazihiro ,  the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for american life .  he is constantly shadowed by saito  ( sab shimono )  ,  the nephew of assan's ceo who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order .  while given a light touch ,  these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the japanese working culture .   with hunt stevenson dominating the script ,  michael keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work .  'gung ho' is indeed a slam-dunk success for keaton ,  who also teamed with ron howard in 1994's 'the paper . ' he made this film during a string of lighter roles that included 'mr .  mom , ' 'beetle juice , ' and 'the dream team' before venturing into 'batman , ' 'one good cop , ' and 'my life . ' it's also hard not to like gedde watanabe's performance as the odd man out ,  who first wears japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit .   the supporting cast is top-notch ,  including wendt ,  turturro ,  shimono ,  and soh yamamura as assan ceo sakamoto .  mimi rogers supplies a romantic interest as audrey ,  hunt's girlfriend .  edwin blum ,  lowell ganz ,  and babaloo mandel teamed up for gung ho's solid writing .  the incidental music ,  which received a bmi film music award ,  was composed by thomas newman .  gung ho's soundtrack songs are wall-to-wall 80s ,  including 'don't get me wrong , ' 'tuff enuff , ' and 'working class man . '  the success of 'gung ho' actually led to a short-lived tv series on abc .  while more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago ,  ron howard's film still has its comic value .  it is available on dvd as part of the paramount widescreen collection and is a tad short-changed .  audio options are provided in english 5 . 1 surround ,  english dolby surround ,  and french 'dubbing , ' but subtitles are in english only .  there are no extras ,  not even the theatrical trailer .  on the plus side ,  paramount's digital transfer is quite good ,  with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound .  while a few extras would have been helpful - especially that 'gung ho' was a box office success - there's little to complain about the film presentation itself .   *** out of 4
wow ,  it's been years since i last saw this movie .  watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986 .  initially i didn't' think i would make it through the movie .  hunt stevenson  ( michael keaton )  was so obnoxious ,  arrogant and disrespectful that i found it hard to watch him .  he embodied every negative stereotype of americans .  if that wasn't bad enough ,  once the small american town's finest workers were shown the image only got worse .  on the opposite spectrum the japanese were presented as emotionless ,  robotic workaholics .  the movie wasn't even all that funny ,  i only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it .  and i'm glad i continued the watch .   just like boxing ,  judges are swayed by how you finish the round .  this movie went from about a three up to the seven i rated it because of the ending .  the end was excellent .  you always want a harmonious ending and this was just that .  it was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory ,  but what was most special was the marriage between the japanese customs and values and the american customs and values .  it was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note . 
this comedy is bound to be good from the get-go .  east meets west and east doesn't want to lose .  .  . west doesn't know what losing is like .  it starts a little slow but it grabs you very soon and it doesn't let go .  this is definitely worth seeing . 
the matador is a strange film .  its main character julian ,  played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by brosnan ,  is not your typical hero .  julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises .  having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely .  and so ,  after a chance meeting at a bar with danny  ( greg kinnear )  ,  he latches on and begins a halting ,  awkward friendship .  danny ,  the quintessential nice guy ,  is dealing with some stuff in his own life and ,  truth be told ,  could use a friend as well .  the two make an unexpected connection ,  and danny sticks around to hear julian's story ,  even after learning the  " unsavory "  truth about julian's work .   matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema ,  the anti-hero assassin  ( films like 'assassins' and 'grosse pointe blank' come to mind )  .  but matador differs in several key ways .  first of all ,  the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail ,  meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you .  and second ,  unlike most anti-hero films ,  matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character .  julian's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing .  this is unusual ,  given that 99 . 99% of us would consider killing for money horrific .  and yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic .  although we don't like to admit it ,  almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough ,  maybe even murder .  did julian's victims deserve to die ?  who is paying to have people killed ?  who knows .  the movie never deals with these questions .  the focus is on julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship .  if you read about someone like julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer ,  but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity .  sympathy for the devil ,  i guess .   brosnan's take on julian is well done and deeply unsettling .  he doesn't completely divorce himself from his james bond good looks and smooth charm ,  but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix .  weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance .  it keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him .  it's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays ,  but it works .  the films only other major role ,  that of danny ,  is not nearly as meaty .  kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular joe with a regular joe life and problems .   the film doesn't really have any huge shocks or m night shyamalan twists ,  but i wasn't able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying .  it doesn't have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human .  and it didn't have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet i thought the pacing was well done and i was never bored .  maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another ,  and how those needs have no moral prerequisites .  even a murderer needs friends ,  and even good people can be friends with bad people .  it's a comment on the strange ,  random world we live in .  a good film ;  worth seeing . 
this is a wonderful movie with a fun ,  clever story and the dynamics of culture differences and the running theme of what's important in life make this a very under-appreciated movie .  don't let the cynics of the world deter you from seeing this .  keaton has wonderful moments and i wonder at the fact that comedy is never appreciated ,  because actors like keaton make going from humor to serious bits look tremendously easy .  great movie all around ! 
a very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of gm's flint ,  michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of japanese automakers in the us .  set in western pennsylvania ,  it features great performances by michael keaton ,  gedde watanabe ,  and george wendt .  music by blues legend stevie ray vaughan . 
surprised to see the rather low score for this movie .  just saw this film for the first time in 10 years ,  and was reminded why i like it .   come back with me ,  children ,  to a time when michael keaton was a straight-up comedy guy ,  and you might find some joy in this film .  it's a gentle comedy -- the kind ron howard specializes in -- but if that's your thing ,  you should check this out .  keaton's low-key charm is just right for this project .    " gung ho "  is a bit dated ,  because it takes places in the last stage of the pre-global economy world ,  when it still mattered what country a business was based in .  that said ,  it delivers laughs as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other ,  to great benefit .   you could watch this film and enjoy it without remembering one scene in particular you really liked ,  but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughs .  it's like an i . v .  drip .  and i mean that in a good way . 
i think it great example of the differences between two cultures .  it would be a great movie to show in a sociology class .  i thought it was pretty funny and i must say that i am a sucker for that  " lets band together and get the job done "  plot device .  it seems most people don't realize that this movie is not just a comedy .  it has a few dramatic elements in it as well and i think they blend in nicely .  overall ,  i give it a solid 8 . 
gung ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again .  michael keaton is put in charge of wooing a japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of hadleyville .  what happens after that is one hilarious moment after another .  the two cultures clash and it is up to keaton to hold things together .  look for great performances from keaton ,  gedde watanabe ,  george wendt ,  mimi rogers ,  john turturro ,  soh yamamura and sab shimomo .  all are perfectly cast .  don't be fooled by the low number rating .  this is a 7 . 5 in my book .  it is interesting to note that the town name of hadleyville was also used in high noon .  yes ,  there is a real hadleyville but in oregon . 
sherman ,  set the wayback machine for .  .  .  1986 .  the united states was just climbing out of its worst postwar recession ,  while japan was enjoying an unprecedented industrial boom .  manufacturing industries were still a significant part of the us economy ,  and factory workers were a good example of the  " average american "  .  the word  " downsizing "  hadn't entered the general vocabulary yet ,  but everyone knew the phenomenon .  bruce could be heard on the radio singing ,   " foreman says these jobs are going ,  boy ,  and they ain't coming back to your hometown .  "  chrysler had just been bailed out by uncle sam .  bumper stickers could be seen saying  " buy american -- the job you save may be your own .  "    " gung ho "  does a better job of capturing the mood of the american industrial workforce than just about any other popular movie made during that period .  certainly the movie has its flaws -- some loose plot threads and mediocre acting jobs by everyone except michael keaton and gedde watanabe .  but the story really is about the meeting of east and west :  keaton's hunt stevenson personifies america ,  brash and confident on the outside yet insecure underneath .  watanabe's kazuhiro personifies japan ,  on top of the heap with a successful system ,  but wondering if there is more to be learned from their western rivals .  the movie's plot ,  flawed as it is ,  simply provides a framework for the conflict ,  and eventually synthesis ,  of their two personalities .   keaton's acting overshadows everyone else's ,  and practically makes the movie by itself .  i've always admired keaton for his ability to deliver lines that feel improvised ,  no matter what script he's following .  his character ,  hunt stevenson ,  is a likable ,  affable everyman ,  a natural leader with a wise-ass streak .  but he has a fatal flaw common to many of us :  he doesn't want to disappoint anyone .  he'll distract the crowd with inspirational anecdotes ,  and even lie ,  rather than point out the ugly truth .   kazuhiro is the mirror image of stevenson :  shy and introspective ,  but also ,  because of his japanese upbringing ,  reluctant to be the bearer of bad news .  the scene in which stevenson first comes to kazuhiro with the employees' grievances captures perfectly the japanese approach to workplace conflict .  kazuhiro replies to stevenson's complaints with  " i understand what you are saying ,  "  but won't refuse his requests out loud .  stevenson misinterprets this as agreement ,  and goes away saying ,   " okay ,  we've got that settled .  "   ( this is still a problem in japanese-american business relations in the 21st century !  )   ultimately ,  kazuhiro and stevenson have the same problem :  get the factory working smoothly ,  meet production goals ,  and fulfill their responsibility to the workers under them .  in working towards this goal ,  they each have to take a page from the others' book .  kazuhiro's family becoming more  " americanized "  is an obvious example .  also note that stevenson thinks it's odd when kazuhiro explains how he had to make a public apology to his workers for failing them -- and yet ,  later in the movie ,  stevenson does exactly that himself .   the plot and its resolution are a little cornball ,  but hey ,  this is a comedy .  if you can overlook the movie's flaws ,  there is a great story about self-realization and open-mindedness here . 
you play as b . j .  blazkowicz ,  a us secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover nazi secret and turn the tide of world war ii .  that means everything from breaking out of a nazi dungeon to thwarting hitler's war machine and even the fuhrer himself .   this is quite possibly the most influential game of its time .  that's because it literally inspired obsession .  many games existed at the time and even more do today ,  but every so often you get a real grabber .  this is one of them .  just like tetris before it and more recently gta iii in 2002 .  yes ,  doom is better in almost every respect ,  but the shots heard around the world which led to one of gaming's biggest tidal waves were fired by b . j .  blazkowicz .  the space marine ,  duke nukem ,  max payne ,  serious sam ,  john mullins ,  jc denton ,  agent 47 ,  gordon freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys at id .  whether directly or ,  in most cases ,  indirectly ,  but they still do .   even with its old look ,  very aged graphics ,  super simple gameplay  ( this is really a game ,  games now border on the  " experience level "  )  and highly rectangular levels ,  the scope of all six episodes provides lots of fun .  especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them .   also :   " halt !  "  *bang !  bang !  bang ! *  " aarrrgh !  !  !  "  never grows old .  --- 8/10  voluntarily rated pc-13 for  " profound carnage .  "  however ,  it's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today . 
many neglect that this isn't just a classic due to the fact that it's the first 3d game ,  or even the first shoot-'em-up .  it's also one of the first stealth games ,  one of the only ( and definitely the first )  truly claustrophobic games ,  and just a pretty well-rounded gaming experience in general .  with graphics that are terribly dated today ,  the game thrusts you into the role of b . j .  ( don't even *think* i'm going to attempt spelling his last name !  )  ,  an american p . o . w .  caught in an underground bunker .  you fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes ( but ,  let's face it ,  most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon ,  surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders )  .  the graphics are ,  as i mentioned before ,  quite dated and very simple .  the least detailed of basically any 3d game released by a professional team of creators .  if you can get over that ,  however ( and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you )  ,  then you've got one heck of a good shooter/sneaking game .  the game play consists of searching for keys ,  health and ammo ,  blasting enemies ( aforementioned nazis ,  and a  " boss enemy "  per chapter )  of varying difficulty ( which ,  of course ,  grows as you move further in the game )  ,  unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms .  there is a bonus count after each level is beaten .  .  .  it goes by how fast you were ( basically ,  if you beat the 'par time' ,  which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level ;  this can be quite fun to try and beat ,  and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in ,  they are even challenging after many play-throughs )  ,  how much nazi gold ( treasure )  you collected and how many bad guys you killed .  basically ,  if you got 100% of any of aforementioned ,  you get a bonus ,  helping you reach the coveted high score placings .  the game  ( mostly ,  but not always )  allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing .  .  .  stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see .  you can either run or walk ,  and amongst your weapons is also a knife .  .  .  running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard ,  as is gunshots .  many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you ,  meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them .  .  .  nearly silently .  in your inventory ,  you can get no less than four weapons and two keys .  .  .  more about the weapons later .  the keys unlock certain doors .  most doors in the game aren't locked .  .  .  only two kinds need keys ,  and these keys are only introduced in later levels ( you restart in levels ,  resetting weaponry ,  health ,  score and lives in each chapter )  .  much of the later game is spent looking for them .  now ,  as i just alluded to ,  this game ,  like many of the period ( late 80's ,  early 90's )  ,  is based on collecting extra lives .  .  .  personally ,  i think it's completely and utterly useless ( it was mercifully dropped from here on end .  .  .  i think (  ?  )  ,  from the next 3d shooter and onwards )  ,  since you can save anytime you want and 'using a life' resets weaponry ,  health and ammo ,  like starting on a new chapter ( which is a real pain in later levels ,  where you *need* heavier artillery )  .  now ,  i shall beat around the bush no longer .  .  .  moving on to the guns !  you start with aforementioned knife ( which is silent but only effective up close )  and a pistol .  .  .  nothing special ,  but good for conserving ammo ,  unlike the next two bad boys .  your third weapon is a german smg .  .  .  a sub-machine-gun .  it's faster and automatic ,  and some later enemies use it .  and the last one .  .  .  is nothing short of a gatling gun !  oh yeah !  think t2 .  think predator .  think about unloading massive amounts of lead into nazi fiends with such a gun .  it's every bit as entertaining as it sounds .  most of the boss enemies use this ,  though ,  so be prepared .  i won't reveal the identities of these boss enemies ,  however .  .  .  that's for each player to discover for him ( or her ) self .  the sound is excellent .  .  .  very crisp and realistic .  as you hear the tear of a machine-gun firing ,  the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german ,  you truly feel like you are there ,  trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems .  that segues me nicely into the level design .  .  .  as you run through seemingly countless ,  nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further ,  you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood .  i almost got motion sickness more than once ( though that might also have something to do with little sleep ,  lots of humidity and unusual warmth .  .  .  )  from playing .  though the level of detail isn't terribly high ,  what there is is great .  remains of victims ,  guards' quarters and countless nazi symbols .  .  .  the list goes on .  the game also features quite a bit of gore .  .  .  for it's limited graphics engine ,  john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game .  what is there left to say .  .  .  the first of its kind ,  and it's no wonder this spawned countless others 3d shooters .  sure ,  weapon bobbing and different height levels ( stairs and such )  didn't come around until the next entry into the genre .  .  .  doom .  .  .  and it was duke nukem 3d that introduced the feature of switching your view ( so it goes beyond simply left and right ,  adding vertical dimensions to it )  ,  and jumping didn't come around until a third ,  later title ( the first quake ,  possibly ?  fellow gamers ,  help me out here )  .  .  .  but all of those games ,  as well as the rest of the genre ,  owe their existence to this one .  so load up the luger ,  open the door to enter the bunker and step into b . j . 's shoes .  .  .  he deserves the recognition ,  even ( or maybe even especially ?  )  nearly fifteen years after he first appeared .  i recommended this to all fans of 3d games .  8/10
 .   .   . but it was on a uhf channel and the reception was very fuzzy .  i'd really like to own the movie since the reason i watched it in the first place is because i am a bus driver and at the time i saw this movie ,  i was driving that model bus .  it was only  ( during his murder trial some 15 years later )  that i remember vaguely that oj was one of the stars in it .  i only recall that he was the driver and of the bus' being shot up and driven wildly .  i've been looking all over for this movie to no avail ,  since viewing it in the mid-80s .  i liked the movie ,  i don't usually watch thrillers ,  but after reading the summary in the tv guide ,  and viewing its beginning  ( although fuzzy )  i stayed for the whole thing . 
well you take o . j .  simpson as a all american soldier turned all american bus driver who decides to rescue his passengers on his own just incase no one else is going to and arte johnson in an absolutely straight role as the tour guide who doesn't know what to do but doesn't want to admit they are in trouble and combine it with lorenzo lamas as one of three baby faced bad boys who intend to kidnap an heiress and leave a busload of people to die on the dessert and you have got to have action ,  plot twists and a lot of drama .  everyone was good but seeing lamas as the baddest of the bad boys really blew my mind .  he was much too believable as the overbearing bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress but rape the women and humiliate the guy who tried to stop him .  this was evidently long before he cultivated his good guy image .  and believe me a 20 year old lorenzo in tight jeans you really don't want to miss ! 
richard dix decided to retire and so michael duane took his place playing the role as ted nichols who meets up with a young french girl named alice dupres barkley ,   ( lenore aubert )  .  this couple only knew each other for two days and they decided to get married by a justice of the peace  ( judge )  and it is pouring rain when they pull up to the judge's home and find out he is not home and will not return until the next day .  as the couple are inside the house you see some one lift up the hood of their car and takes an automobile part from the engine .  once you see this event happening you realize this couple is in for a big surprise and the story beings to reveal a very mysterious event which surrounds alice barkley and so poor ted nichols starts out with plenty of trouble and no marriage .  good mystery ,  but i missed richard dix .  enjoy . 
the matador  ( 2005 )  *** _ pierce brosnan ,  greg kinnear ,  hope davis ,  philip baker hall ,  dylan baker .  brosnan gives one of his best non-bondian roles as a middle-aged assassin facing a mid-life crisis while on assignment in mexico where he befriends a square yet likable american businessman  ( kinnear at his most affable )  and discovers there is more to life than death .  newbie filmmaker richard shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath-of-fresh-air into the 'buddy comedy' formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing brosnan to get his ya-yas out with devilish glee .  a sleeper gem indie hit . 
i hate reading reviews that say something like ,  'don't waste your time ,  this film stinks on ice . ' it does to that reviewer yet for me ,  it may have some sort of naïve charm .  if you like the other 'whistler' series films ,  this one will be watchable .  if you like 40s noirish films ,  this one will be watchable .   this film is not as good ,  in my opinion ,  as any of the earlier series entries which starred richard dix as the protagonist .  it's much slower ,  and the plot is trite .  you've seen this same narrative device used in many other films ,  and usually better .   but the acting is good ,  and so is the lighting ,  and the dialog .  it's just lacking in energy and you'll likely figure out exactly what's going on and how it's all going to come out in the end not more than a quarter of the way through .   the 'whistler' series is semi-noir ,  and there character ,  mood ,  lighting ,  camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself .  but this film is not noir .  it's too light weight and hollywood innocent for that .  neither richard dix's character nor those of any of his ladies in the previous films had to come to a good end .  you just never knew until the end .   but still ,  i'll recommend this one for at least a single viewing .  i've watched it at least twice myself ,  and got a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of it both times . 
this was the eighth and final columbia whistler film and the only one without richard dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year .  it's still a competent thriller ,  the machine carried on without him perfectly ,  but  something was missing :  dix !  the stories in the whistler series were always interesting ,  sometimes brilliant ,  the screenplays often noir always atmospheric ,  but it wasn't only the whistler himself that hung it all together on screen ,  dix did too .   young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad .  is the potential groom put off ,  even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams ,  or is love blind ?  who's twisting who is the question .  michael duane in his penultimate film is ok if a bit of a wimp ,  lovely lenore aubert's finest moments came next film in abbott & costello meet frankenstein ,  and richard lane was wonderful as ever on loan from boston blackie .  also the only outing where the whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain ,  unless he got sprayed with sea foam in voice .   a lot happened in this last hour ,  well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me .  the whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows ,  nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what i've heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to as well . 
i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in 1975 ,  when it was shown in combination with the red balloon .  both films are similar in their dream-like quality .  the bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner ,  a little boy ,  is away at school .  a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are ,  and begins to warily stalk his  " prey .  "  the boy begins his walk home from school ,  and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend .  the fish becomes agitated by the cat's presence ,  and finally jumps out of the bowl !  the cat quickly walks over to the fish ,  gently picks him up with his paws ,  and returns him to his bowl .  the boy returns happily to his fish ,  none the wiser .   the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity .  it is hard to imagine how the director could've pulled the technical feat back in 1959 -- it seems more a trick for 2003 .   if you can find it ,  watch it -- you won't be disappointed !  and if you *do* find it ,  let me know so i can get a copy ,  too ! 
this film reinvents the term  " spring breakumentary .  "  hans ,  the fat one of the group ,  displays his talents as this generations chris farley .  johnny kansas ,   " the king of the $1 bet ,  "  shows he's not in kansas anymore by consistently upping the stakes .  kyle's laugh is truly infecting ,  and offers a little eye-candy for the ladies as well  ( as does matt )  .  the dwarfs ,  while having their moments ,  did not do justice to the mexican hat dance like it deserves .  and last ,  we have our protagonist ,  ed .  he gives hope to all of us bumbling ,  stumbling ,  gangly ,  pale folk who are still searching for that special someone .  and that hope ,  is a little place called cabo san lucas .  while this blockbuster just missed the theaters ,  this is a must rent ,  as we can all relate to one of these spring breakumentarions . 
i can tell you just how bad this movie is .  i was in the movie and i haven't seen it yet ,  but i cringe at the thought of anyone actually paying to see me drunk .  especially considering what we did that year .  the thing is that they probably over edited it .  especially the scene where my roommate was snorting coke of the tits of a mexican prostitute  ( they probably should have followed him around )  .  we made a few come and go appearances but aside from that i can't really remember anything .  i was the mc in a few scenes  ( from what i'm told .  what i can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since who wants to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tits to the world  ( or the girl that loser lost his virginity to )  .  overall the trip itself was crazy but people act different once the camera is on them . 
i have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes ,  i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me .  notwithstanding this is not a  " movie with a plot "  ,  its about real guys and some of the  " problems "  that they face .  i found the movie hilarious ( especially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other )  .  simply put ,  if you are in the same  " wave-length "  as these people ,  you will find this movie amazing .  i don't think that this is going win any golden globes or oscars ,  or that the people in this movie will become future hollywood stars ,  but its a kind of  " cult-classic "  among young people who could relate to their experience .  for me the guy that stands out the most is hans :  the scandinavian guy , who  , according to him  " isnt a looker "  ,  but gets all ( or some )  of the chicks .  the  " little-people "  also play a big part in the movie ,  especially when they are drunk .  if i keep going ,  i might provide a spoiler and i don't want to do that ,  just go and get the movie and you will not regret .  i give it a 8/10
when an orphanage manager goes on vacation ,  his father takes over the details of the center and winds up renting the kids .  when a well off ,  got it made couple with a nice apartment and great life get the notion to adopt this idea was tailor made for them .  why would they want to spoil their elegant existence with a trio of hairbrained carpet creepers ?  no way would people like these two need kids to make life wonderful .  this movie makes it look like the real world works this way ,  but i am the picture of dubiety . 
the cast was good ,  and i thought it was a good performance from christopher lloyd ,  whom i like from previous movies .  the movie was a great family movie ,  nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids ,  a good story line ,  lots of laughs ,  lighthearted and enjoyable .  if you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill .  kid pleasing ,  and not difficult for a parent to watch ,  either . 
this movie is an extremely funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble .  when the director goes on vacation ,  his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things .   this is positively the best work that leslie nielson has ever done .  his idea in the film to rent out children is immediately innovative ,  and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh .   the little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that i know i will never forget her .  just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie !    such great family entertainment is so rare these days .  if you go for slightly corny pictures with happy endings , go for this one !  i could watch this over and over ,  and i often do !  my only complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy . 
russ and valerie are having discussions about starting a family .  the couple live in a posh apartment and run an auction business that deals with valuable collectibles .  at the same time ,  a dedicated adoption agency owner takes a mini vacation and leaves the orphanage in the charge of his father  ( leslie nielsen )  .  father harry is in the rental business and he gets the brilliant idea to  " rent "  some of the children of the orphanage to couples like russ and valerie .  harry ,  who becomes aware of the couple'e dilemma ,  offers a family of siblings for a 10 day rental period !  brandon ,  kyle ,  and molly move into the apartment with their temporary parents ,  with amusing consequences ,  as the new caretakers are inexperienced with kids .  but ,  where is the possibility of a happy ending ?  this is a darling family film .  the actors ,  including nielsen as the wheeler-dealer and christopher lloyd as the kind apartment doorman ,  are all wonderful .  the script is snappy and fun and the overall production values quite high .  yes ,  if only life could be this way !  orphaned children everywhere deserve a chance to prove that they are lovable and can give so much joy to the parents who are considering adoption .  if you want to show a film to your family that is rooted in good values but is also highly entertaining ,  find this movie .  it is guaranteed to have everyone laughing ,  even as their hearts are melting . 
pierce brosnan has sipped his last martini and returns ,  in an outrageous self-parody ,  as the aging foul-mouthed boozy assassin julian noble ,  who has a particular fondness for teenage girls ,  bullfights and tacky clothes .  during a job in mexico city he meets danny  ( greg kinnear )  ,  a straight-faced denver suburban business-man ,  who's in town to make his deal of-a-life-time ,  in a hotel bar .  despite their completely different personalities and julian's crude and insensible remarks ,  they become friends .    largely carried by the performances of pierce brosnan and greg kinnear ,  director richard shepard revealed that he didn't write the film with pierce brosnan in mind  ,  but i can hardly imagine this without him .  he proves to have a real talent for comedy and can be more than just james bond or cold-war spies .  the scene in which the two meet at a glossy hotel bar  ( stunning sets and beautifully photographed )  really is a bravura piece of acting skills .  the scene lasts almost fifteen minutes ,  and although it was probably carefully scripted ,  the two actors are largely improvising ,  but they succeed wonderfully !  it almost feels like a new standard in screen acting .  think of robert de niro and harvey keitel in mean steets improvising and add one of the most subtle underpinnings of many genre clichés and the actors' own typecasting  ( brosnan's james bond in particular )  ,  and you got one of the most delightful pairings in recent hollywood .    sadly ,  the story wears thin after a while .  after an hour ,  the film just runs out of steam .  nevertheless ,  and i can't put my finger on it exactly ,  i did enjoy this very much .  it just feels very fresh and original ,  with some imaginative use of sets and lighting ,  and some hints to seijun suzuki and jean-pierre melville .  the other characters aren't given much to do ,  but this film does offer something new ,  in that respect it almost effortlessly succeeds in blending all conventional genres into quite an entertaining spoof .  very amusing .   camera obscura --- 7/10
i ran across this movie at the local video store during their yearly sidewalk sale .  while scanning thousands of videos ,  hoping to find a few cartoon movies for sale ,  i came across this movie .  i read the back of the movie and knew it was god's hand at work for me to purchase this movie .  you see ,  i have a sibling group of three foster  ( and soon to be adopted )  children living with my family .  immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children starring in the movie .  the movie helped them better understand their own circumstances .  for the first time ,  also ,  the oldest of the sibling group  ( 7 year old/female )  decided to open up to me a little bit about her past and the trauma she had experienced .  she has been fighting the entire trust issue .  this is also the first time i had seen her cry .  after watching the film ,  i asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted .  she replied ,   " it means to be happy .  "  a must see for families who are fostering children and are considering adoption .  it certainly opened the lines of communication with us . 
astounding .  .  .  .  . this may have been a poor attempt at remaking the already recreated omen movie ,  but i sure enjoyed it .   that last man who commented is a fool ,  this movie was one of a kind ,  and the music dark ,  jerry goldsmith himself ,  would had applaud this movie .   great recommendations from myself to watch or buy this film .   i collect horror movies and soundtracks ,  so listen to what i have to say ,  not that other idiot .   there is only one thing that do not fascinate me ,  the endings .   according to prophecy it is all inaccurate ,  including final conflict ,  and left behind .   but my conclusion being .  .  .  .  there great movies .  .  . and should be seen ,  before the great depression falls upon us ,  and before the democrats take over the presidency too .   so signed .  .  .  . jacob eder .  .  . a farmer ,  with a mastermind . 
i thought the movie was actually pretty good .  i enjoyed the acting and it moved along well .  the director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell .  i have to see the big budget one coming out today ,  obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable .  when you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it .  there were some things that could of been better but most are budget related .  the acting was pretty good the f/x and stunts were well done .  a couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst .  and the boy who played the child .  these kind of films have kept la working and this is one that turned out ok . 
i absolutely loved this show .  i watched it from the time it first aired in the late 90's to the very last episode .  in my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days .  definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your children .  yes things have changed a bit with jo since we last saw her in the books ,  but it's still compelling with great stories and good lessons .  the actress that portrays jo bhaer  ( michelle burke )  does a wonderful job as does as the actor who plays nick riley  ( spencer rochfort )  throughout the series we get to see the developing romance between jo and nick as well as the daily stories and lessons the kids and students learn .  i recommend this show to anyone . 
i found this show really late at night ,  and gave it a try .  it's a refreshing change from the other kinds of things shown late at night ,  if you catch my drift .  its simplicity of values and sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as children .  it's something i indulge in whenever i find it on  ( which is rare ,  maybe i should actually check the listings !  haha )  .  .  .  .  .  and the tension between joe and nick is so cute .  like any good chick flick ,  you really get emotionally involved in the characters .  good ol' louisa may alcott still inspiring good stories  :  )  so apparently i must complete 10 lines of text in order for my opinion to be valid ,  so i guess i'll tell you a bit more .  the kids are played by talented actors and actresses ,  and the settings are lovely and nature-filled -- another thing you don't see much on television .  i hope everyone gives it a shot .  i recognize and am fully aware that it's sappy ,  but it's good heart .  like i said before ,  it's refreshing . 
i was a fan of the book ever since third grade ,  so of course i had watched the movie ,  read the sequel ,  and then watched the television show .  it was a good show in itself ,  and now as an adult i still enjoy the show .  my only real problem with it was that it didn't follow the book .  the first time i saw it ,  i was so disappointed that i turned it off .  but that's coming from a girl who owns a first addition of the book .  but after time i decided to give it a try again and ignored the book  ( kind of like what you have to do with the harry potter movies )  .  i found the series wonderful !  it was clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy ,  just the right amount comedy to keep everyone going .  it is truly enjoyable !  clean and wonderful ! 
the kids ,  aged 7 to 14 ,  got such a huge kick out of this film that we gave a copy to all of the other kids on our birthday list this year .  they all loved it !  kids from 2 to 7 watch it repeatedly and frequently ,  and we get a kick out of watching it with them .   it's rare that a film entertains the kids for so long ,  and offers laughs for the adults ,  too .  most enjoy it more than the first .   top-quality production and an excellent cast ,  led by christopher showerman as a superior george--athletic ,  energetic ,  and wholly credible ,  with a lovable innocence and a particular knack of taking a tree in the face--well supported by the inimitable christina pickles as the evil mother-in-law ,  thomas haden church as the evil jerk rival ,  and everybody else .  this is fun . 
in order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre it's supposed to be :  children's .  they had more guidelines to follow in order to make this movie  ( meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or language from the 1st )  taking all that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch .  sequels usually make me nervous ,  however this one did pretty well for itself .  knowing that it didn't have the star power of fraiser as george they capitalized on the humor and i believe showeman did pretty well as the lead .  the plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at times fits well for a younger audience ,  if you want to watch a movie and hope for academy award honors this is not it ,  but if you want to watch a simple ,  fun ,  energy filled movie you would make a good choice with this one . 
i loved this movie !  chris showerman did an amazing job !  not only is he an incredible actor ,  but he is gorgeous with an awesome physique !  he did a great job on the delivery of his lines ,  plus transformed into george better than fraser did .  a great performance for his first major roll !  this movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love .  my kids have watched this movie numerous times since we purchased the dvd the day it came out .  in addition to the movie ,  the extras on the dvd are just as hilarious .  two thumbs up on this one !  i highly recommend it to everyone ! 
allow me to just get to the bottom line here :  i've got 3 kids ,  ages 5 to 10 .  i consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals .  i've seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times .  i can tell you when the film gets reversed in the wizard of oz ,  the over-18 sexual joke in el dorado and the tragic flaw with the ending of rudolph the red-nosed reindeer .  i could probably storyboard nemo from memory alone .   what makes me support the one child of mine  ( it varies )  who suggests this title for the family movie of an evening ?  in a word :  showerman .   moment of silence .  .  .   *sigh*
the matador is hit-man movie lite .  .  .  . if you can say that about a hit-man movie .  the violence is never really shown but often introduced .  at first i was scared i was in for another retread of mid-90s gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy but was happily surprised when i realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship .  nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning .  the three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together .  the writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes .  this is a good film that i probably won't remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy .  good film . 
i like peter sellers ,  most of the time .  i had never seen him portray an upper-class brit until this movie .  he pulls it off pretty well ,  although you see bits of inspector clouseau in the mix .  it doesn't get interesting until goldie hawn arrives .   i never expected the youthful hawn to deliver such a solid performance .  her timing was great and her expressions were priceless .  the way she alternately shoots sellers lecherous character down and seduces him is beautiful to watch .  verbal sparring like i've seldom seen from a movie of that era .   the last thirty minutes of the movie does fall flat .  it is worth the let down just to see the first sixty .  hawn is nude for a few glorious seconds early on .  enjoy it .  .  . 
i ran across this movie on the tv and could not turn it off .  peter sellers plays an unlikable fellow who falls for an extremely warm and cute goldie hawn  ( who wouldn't ?  )  .  the way that goldie's character holds herself from the beginning of the movie to the end is untraditional even today .  this movie gave me a different angle into human relations and also i found it very funny .  peter sellers role was a difficult sell ,  but i think he pulls it off well . 
not sure why it doesn't play in peoria ,  apparently ,  but this is a very funny ,  clever british comedy .  it's set at the end of the  " swinging sixties "  .  peter sellars is fantastic as the rich ,  forty-something serial womaniser .  the perfectly delectable goldie hawn ,  playing a 19 year american girl in london ,  is ,  initially ,  sellars'  " catch of the day "  .  but the urbane tv food critic can't stop himself from falling for the dizzy american blond .   humour ,  pathos ,  great script ,  strong performances from the leads and supporting caste .   it's a great film ,  and the best gag is the very last line .   try it ,  you'll like it . 
although the plot was a bit sappy at times ,  and very rushed at the end ,  as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story ,  overall it was pretty good for the made-for-backwoods-cable-tv genre .    however ,  the actress who played the babysitter ,  mariana klaveno ,  was very good !  i hope to see more of her around in movie-land .  the music was also well done ,  getting every possible chill out of the dah-duh-dah-duh  ( think  " jaws "  )  type music-based tension build-ups .   i don't think i'd want to watch  " while the children sleep "  again ,  but if i did ,  it would be to focus on the performance of the talented klaveno . 
lupin sets off for morocco ,  looking for a legendary treasure .  his only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him .  it's a nice different location for lupin ,  with the desert and that hot exotic feel .   one interesting thing about this movie is that jigen has a much smaller role than usual ,  generally being in a different place than lupin .  on one hand their classic dynamic together is missed ,  but it is a change of pace .  plus ,  this way ,  lupin can focus on the ladies .  .  .   fujiko rules in this .  throughout the entire feature she is seducing lupin ,  and us viewers .  then there's lara ,  the damsel of this particular tale ,  and she's quite likable .  this one has more nudity than any other lupin anime ,  which is a fun distinction to have .   there's a very entertaining effeminate ninja guy who's the best villain in this ,  and naturally he has some great fighting with goemon ,  as well as some fun scenes with fujiko .  inspector zenigata of course is also on a warpath here ,  in fine form .   pretty much ,  this is a smooth ride with lupin .  the plot is average and there are some slow spots ,  but all in all this movie is a real pleasure .  enjoy . 
this movie is more lupin then most ,  especially coming from funimation .  other then the bad dub ,  it isn't bad .   the first hour is a lot like the comic  ( which is what all lupin the 3rd stuff is based on )  .  lupin's trying to get a huge treasure .  fujiko's using lupin's weakness to women to try to get something out of it .  the last bit isn't that bad ,  he's with another women ,  but of course fujiko's still him number one .   a lot of the other lupin movies are more family with cuss words then lupin .  any good lupin fan i think will be pleasantly surprised  ( i know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie )  .  it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits  ( they make it a little mushy )  but overall ,  it isn't a bad film .  good enough to be one of the few i'd watch again of the lupin iii movies . 
eric stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as joel garcia ,  a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident .  while learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition joel befriends slick ,  fast-talking ,  charming womanizer raymond  ( an amazing wesley snipes )  and boorish ,  surly ,  racist biker bloss  ( a terrific william forsythe )  ,  who feels threatened by the diverse multi-ethnic array of fellow patients he's forced to share a room with .  joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving ,  but married girlfriend anna  ( radiantly played by helen hunt )  .  but he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own .   this remarkable movie's key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through .  directors neil jimenez  ( who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script )  and micheal steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste ,  wit and warmth ,  specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter-of-factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one's lifestyle ,  including and especially your sex life  ( this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when joel and anna try and fail to make love in a motel room )  .  besides the expected poignancy ,  the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw ,  earthy humor that's highlighted by the uproarious sequence with joel and bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club .  the uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus :  stoltz ,  snipes ,  forsythe and hunt are all outstanding ,  with stand-out supporting turns by grace zabriskie as bloss' doting ,  amiable mother and elisabeth pena and william allen young as compassionate hospital nurses .  despite the grim subject matter ,  the film ultimately proves to be a very moving ,  positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit .  a simply wonderful little gem of a drama . 
this work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs .  this film never tries to tone it down ,  cotton candy-ize ,  or soft soap the angst ,  confusion ,  and pain of what these guys live with .  that is its strength ,  i think .   but more so ,  the performances are fantastic ,  with well conceived and delivered dialog ,  which draws you in and makes you feel a part of the experience .  the characters never attempt to block out the audience from knowing what's on their mind-what's in their hearts .   i found it plodding ,  but enjoyable .   it rates a 6 . 6/10 from .  .  .   the fiend  :  . 
i recently got the chance to view  " the waterdance "  ,  and quite liked it .  i don't really understand why its called that as there isn't really any dancing going on there ,  except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end .  we are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie ,  invalids in a hospital .  the story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman ,  which is a very sweet story . unfortunately ,  you don't get to see movies like that today .  im not  " stuck in a time warp "  ,  im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today ,  but i really think the movie industry is deteriorating and there's much we can learn from old movies-by old movies i mean anything from 1920-1998 . 
i thought this was an excellent and very honest portrayal of paralysis and racism .  this movie never panders to the audience and never gets predictable .  the acting was top-notch and the movie reminded me of  " one flew over the cuckoo's nest "  . 
this film lingered and lingered at a small movie theater in town ,  and the word-of-mouth buzz got me to see it .  a comedy about disabled people - the subject matter keeps lots of people away from a funny and heart-warming film . 
touching and sad movie .  portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident .  the film centers on his relationship with his married lover ,  whom he is often very hostile towards ,  and his interactions with other accident victims ,  particularly a black down-and-out and a white-supremacist biker .  the film is often humorous ,  often sad ,  and always believable .  get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy sunday afternoon with your partner . 
 " the matador "  stars pierce brosnan as a burned out assassin .  he's james bond gone to seed ,  in too-tight ,  garish clothes ,  gold chains ,  and an ugly haircut .  our struggling assassin ,  julian noble ,  is in mexico ,  trying to regain his nerve .  staying at the same hotel is a likable ,  down-on-his luck businessman danny wright  ( greg kinnear )  ,  also trying to regain his equilibrium .  danny is desperate to close a deal and return to his wife in denver  ( hope davis )  with good news .   noble and wright unexpectedly become friends .  wright convinces noble to reveal certain techniques ,  which he demonstrates at a bullfight .  noble is eventually targeted by his employers and shows up in denver .    writer and director richard shepard did the q&a after this delightful movie at the austin film festival .  shepard was also down on his luck .  after suffering the loss of his agent and rejection of recent scripts ,  he decided to write a story no one would buy and create a character no one would want to play .  then pierce brosnan called .  brosnan regains his equilibrium in this movie .   ( there is life after bond !  )  he has a wonderful flair for self-deprecating comedy .  don't miss it .    stay for the closing credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting .  i look forward to more of richard shepard's projects . 
it's funny how your life can change in a second .  .  .  to attend ''the waterdance'' for the first time it was an unforgettable experience ,  the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening ,  and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on .    eric stoltz's performances and mainly of helen hunt  ( oh man !  ,  helen is the purest and graceful woman in earth .  .  .  )  are wonderful ,  wesley snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles .  a film simple and at the same time deep that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted :  enjoy each moment of your life .  .  .   really to a film as that the any hour is not attended !  !  !   ( sorry ,  it's a brazilian expression .  .  .  )  . 
i know ,  that's not what you expect from a film with this sort of  lineage- it's a direct descendant of the best years of our lives  and the men .  .  .  films dealing with men who are in the hospital  dealing with tragic circumstances .  but this film is full of wonderful  surprises and performances .  it features stellar performances from  eric stoltz and helen hunt  ( including a rather risque nude scene )   and wesley snipes and william forsythe .  as emanuel levy wrote  in his book cinema of outsiders  ( about the independent film  movement )   " the waterdance is coherant ,  attentive to detail ,  and  unsentimental with a wicked down to earth humor- it' s at once  funny and sad ,  and the entire cast is impressive .  "  i was  extraordinarily moved by this film ,  it's hard hitting yes ,  but also has  very tender moments and laugh out loud moments .  a rare gem . 
_waterdance_ explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the spinally injured artfully .  from the petty torments of faulty fluorescent lights flashing overhead to sexuality ,  masculinity and depression ,  the experience of disability is laid open .   the diversity of the central characters themselves underscores the complexity of the material examined - joel ,  the writer ,  raymond ,  the black man with a murky past ,  and bloss ,  the racist biker .  at first ,  these men are united by nothing other than the nature of their injuries ,  but retain their competitive spirit .  over time ,  shared experience ,  both good and bad ,  brings them together as friends to support one another .   most obvious of the transformations is that experienced by joel ,  who initially distances himself from his fellow patients with sunglasses ,  headphones and curtains .  as he comes to accept the changes that disablement has made to his life ,  joel discards these props and begins to involve himself in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the ward .   the dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep one's head above water ;  to give up the dance is to reject life .  _waterdance_ is a moving and powerful film on many levels ,  and i do not hesitate to recommend it . 
this was one of those films i probably never would have picked off the shelf  ,  but it came on ifc one day and i said - eric stolz ,  william forsythe .  .  . why not ?  if i'd changed the channel ,  i would have really missed a treasure .    the subject is depressing - young author paralyzed in climbing accident convalesces in lower-class rehabilitation center .  it would have been so easy and tempting to make this a manipulative tear-jerker .  but ,  that doesn't happen because it was written by neal jimenez ,  after he himself was accidently paralyzed .  no hollywood happiness here .  all of the patients in the ward come from wildly different backgrounds ,  but they share a feeling of helplessness ,  of being at the mercy of others .  stolz is very good as a  " lone wolf "  type ,  forced into embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend  ( helen hunt )  ;  wesley snipes is fine as a former ladies' man whose family is falling apart ;  but william forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay for taking away his independence .   see this film . 
this film never received the attention it deserved ,  although this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting ,  and one of the most realistic stories i have seen on screen .  clearly filmed on a small budget in a real v . a .  hospital ,  the center of the story is joel ,  very well-played by eric stoltz .  joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident ,  and comes to the hospital to a ward with other men who have spinal injuries .  joel is in love with anna ,  his married lover ,  played by helen hunt ,  who shows early signs of her later academy-award winning work .   although the joel-anna relationship is the basic focus ,  there are many other well-developed characters in the ward .  wesley snipes does a tremendous job as the angry raymond .  even more impressive is william forsythe as the bitter and racist bloss .  i think forsythe's two best scenes are when he becomes frustrated and angry at the square dancers ,  and ,  later ,  when he feels empathy for a young korean man who has been shot in a liquor store hold up .  my favorite scene with snipes is the in the roundtable discussion of post-injury sexual options .   the chemistry between stoltz and hunt is very strong ,  and they have two very intimate ,  but not gratuitous ,  sex scenes .  the orgasm in the ward is both sexy and amusing .  there is also another memorable scene where joel and bloss and the korean boy take the specially-equipped van to the strip bar .  it's truly a comedy of errors as they make their feeble attempts to get the van going to see the  " naked ladies .  "   the story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director ,  neal jimenez ,  is paralyzed in real life .  this is basically his story .  this film is real ,  not glossy or flashy .  to have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing .  i recommend this film to everyone i see ,  because it is one of those films that even improves on a second look .  it's a shame that such a great piece of work gets overlooked ,  but through video ,  perhaps it can get the attention it so richly deserves . 
overall i found this movie quite amusing and fun to watch ,  with plenty of laugh out loud moments .    but ,  this movie is not for everyone .  that is why i created this quick question-ere ,  if you answer yes to any of the following questions than i recommend watching this flick   ( 1 ) do you enjoy crude sexual humor ?   ( 2 ) do you enjoy alcohol related humor ?   ( 2 ) do you enjoy amazingly hot girls ?   ( 3 ) do you enjoy viewing boobs ?   ( 4 ) do you enjoy viewing multiple boobs ?   ( 5 ) did i mention all the nice boobies in this film ?   if you noticed the spoiler alert ,  that is referring the mass amount of nudity you can expect in the movie ,  i myself have no idea what the plot was about .  not that it matters . 
this is one of the funniest and most excellent movies ever made !  although i've only seen forty minuets of it and i must say this is a good movie .  the plot if funny and because there's sex around pretty much every corner of this movie .  it's really funny and i don't see how anyone could not like this film .  i really really really want to watch the rest of the movie .  it has one slightly sick scene in it  ( trust me ,  it's not very pleasant )  but apart from that this is a great movie .  i rate this movie an 7/8 for comedy ,  10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot .  please if your a fan of american pie and you want to watch a movie where there's pretty much all sex in it the buy this movie .  it will please you .   10/10
a lot of people hated this movie ,  but that i blame on two facts - 1 - they want it to be too much like the first couple of american pie movies .  and 2 - they are trying to take it too seriously .   this one i found was the best one out of all six ,  and i absolutely love dwight .  the plot is predictable ,  i'll say that ,  but then what teen comedy isn't ?  road trip ,  dirty deeds etc etc ,  they are all incredibly predictable ,  but still goddamn funny !  i say this is worth watching ,  i love it ,  i find it hilarious .  just don't watch it while comparing it to the first ones because it's nothing alike .   after watching naked mile and this one ,  it became obvious that all the american pie movies were about ,  and only about ,  the stiflers .  which is fine by me .   watch .  enjoy .  love .  xd
funny ,  sexy ,  hot !  !  !  there is no real plot but you needn't anyone .  .  .   so the naked or almost naked girls and the typical fights between college-cliques need no development !   all in all the whole seems to be known from simply every film in this category but the reissuer reached the goal that this film can be recognized out of thousand others .   last thing i've got to say .  unbelievable funny !   you've got to see it !  !  !    and if you are young and you want know more about the female body you've got to see it twice
ok ,  it was a good american pie .  erick stifler goes off to college with his buddy cooze .  during their arrival they meet up with eric's cousin dwight .  the two pledge to become betas and along the way they get involved with a whole lot of sex ,  tits ,  and some hot girls along the way .  in a few words there is a lot more sex ,  nudity and alcohol .  it is a good movie for those who want to enjoy an american pie movie ,  granted it isn't as great as the first three is is a good movie .  if you enjoy hot girls with really nice tits ,  get this movie .  if you enjoy seeing a bunch of dudes making assholes of themselves ,  go to this movie .  if you want to see the full thing ,  get the unrated addition .  one last thing this is a better attempt than the last two american pies . 
 " margaritas and cock .  .  .  "   this tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs ,  surprises and unexpectedly touching moments .  i had more fun watching  " the matador "  than almost any other film from 2005 .  it is a wacky film with an unforgettable character ,  played to perfection by pierce brosnan .   julian noble  ( brosnan )  is a facilitator  ( hit-man )  who specializes in high-end corporate gigs  ( assassinating rich dudes )  .  he is also experiencing something akin to a mid-life crisis .  after coming to realization that he has no real friends ,  no permanent home and no planned future ,  he stumbles into a mexican hotel bar one night and runs into danny wright  ( kinnear )  .   danny is a down-on-his-luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him .  he loves his wife dearly ,  especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlier .   the two men are chalk and cheese ,  hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night .  and somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever .   the friendship they form reminded me a lot of laurel and hardy .  one is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble .  the interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned ,  due in no small part to the wonderful performances from brosnan and kinnear .   but make no mistake .  .  .  this is brosnan's film .  he imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade .  he could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you'd probably forgive him .  brosnan may be cinema's ultimate charmer ,  but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date .  i wouldn't be averse to seeing an oscar nod for this role .   consider one scene where he overtly ogles a high-school girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line ,   " all blushy blushy .  .  .  no sucky fucky "  .  he does it with the familiar bond smirk and manages to get away with it .  he manages to tell a young boy ,   " tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years .  then get back to me "  without coming across as unlikable .  in fact ,  it makes us like him even more .   and yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes ,  most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns .  however ,  when julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday ,  or when danny and his wife  ( davis )  console each other in their bedroom one night ,  the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion .    " the matador "  is stylish and energetic .  it is constantly entertaining .  and it contains a career-defining role for brosnan as the lonely hit-man looking for normalcy ,  friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life .  this is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possible .   tc candler of independentcritics . com
now i love american pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for seann william scott's performance as stifler but after that the quality has dropped .  band camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but naked mile was the same joke and plot- lines recycled  ( erik stifler's sex problem is like jim's )  .  it had some amusing moments like the football game against the midgets and the 'punishment' of coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the 'mile' was just stupid and moronic .  not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex .    anyway enough about the naked mile .  i watched beta house with apprehension as i thought it could take the series to a new low but i was pleasantly surprised .  to be honest there is no real plot but it's filled with hot girls  ( ashley is incredible )  and sex jokes aplenty .  yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but dwight stifler  ( steve talley )  raises the bar with an exuberant performance .  the greek olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while christopher mcdonald's cameo is hilarious .  there are weak points though .  coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first ,  i'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part .    while coozeman is bad erik stifler is worse .  john white made naked mile a pain to watch but in beta house he takes his performance to a whole new low .  first and foremost he lacks charisma ,  a stifler prerequisite .  you really can't care less about him .  the only reason i was bothered about his relationship was so ashley could be on screen !  she shines above him as does the rest of the cast .  seriously john white is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish .    saying that the film does entertain and coozeman's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny .    overall this film is worth renting ,  get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit-fest event and vent your anger at erik 'loser' stifler . 
ti%s and as* ,  lots of boobies .  some great characters ,  fun filled pranks and well put together teen action in this spin off of the amercan pie franchise .  this feels like really old school .  it feels a bit like porkys for the 2000's .  some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise for me .   whilst the original cast is all but gone except for one ,  this movie i found really entertaining .  lets not get too excited ,  you have to take it for the booby teen comedy that it is ,  but for what it is ,  it excels .  the characters are likable and funny ,  the girls are hotter than hell .  the fun and games are hilarious ,  with some stuff i've never seen before in comedies ,  they make me cringe but laugh at the same time .   so ignore the haters and give this a run and see what you think .  don't expect the classic american pie ,  but expect something that should make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so . 
this is by far one of my favorite of the american pie spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character  ( one of the young stiflers )  always seems unrealistic in nature .    for example ap :  the naked mile .  you have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks  ,  and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity  " problem "  and he ends up stopping mid-deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend ,  who keep in mind gave him a  " guilt free pass "  for the weekend .  i can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing but let's be realistic ;  most people who are watching these movies aren't particularly searching for a romantic story .   whereas the most recent installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and good old erik stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses and as always mr .  levenstein lends his  " perfectly natural "  eyebrow humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie . 
i just watched the movie i was afraid it's gonna disappoint me .  i was rather surprised at the end though .  the american pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times .  yes ,  it won't be true if i say that i enjoyed it as mush as i enjoyed the original ones .  beta house along with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies had . it is not gonna become a classic as the first two already did .  but what the hell-it is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school .  beta house deserves 6/10 but i gave it 7/10 just for being another slice of pie . 
wow ,  this was another good spin off of the original american pie ,  not as good as band camp ,  but definitely a lot better the naked mile .  dwight and erik stifler lead the comedy in this one ,  but i actually preferred the dialogue in this one to the naked mile .  the script was written a lot better and the comedy flowed more smoothly ,  however most of the comedy came from sex ,  but that's okay because that's why we watch these movies anyway right ?    the midget rock also had a really good cameo ,  considering the intense effort given by him in the naked mile ,  his scene with stifler was awesome and had me laughing my ass off when i saw it .   the movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile ,  if you liked any previous american pie films ,  you should like beta house ,  unless you view all of the american pie spin-offs a waste of money . 
* firstly ,  although many say it is the worst of the series ,  i don't think that it is true , considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality  . it brings perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenager times when you would have liked to have same fun as the characters do .   * i agree with the fact that it is a teenager movie but comedy movies nowadays aren't supposed to be for teenagers ? i mean .  .  .  cinemas are mostly the place for teenagers to hang out ;  plus  , seeing such a movie during a sleepover or something like that is very good for having a very good time .   * many comment about the amount of nudity in this movie .  well .  .  . let's get real .  .  . doesn't that reflect the thoughts of teen guys like those from the movie ?  what would you like to see .  .  . smart books , romantic stuff ?  that is not at all what would be in those teenagers' minds  .  .  .   * to conclude ,  i think that if you are a teenager ,  you must absolutely see the movie ,  and even if you are a real grown up man or a woman ,  you should see it if you still have a teen mind or you often think about how it was being a teenager , or things like that .  thanks for reading ! 
this movie is plain fun . i has nothing to do with the original america pie ,  but it is fun to watch .   another try ,  but better than band camp and the naked mile ,  at least funnier .   just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out ,  so i decided to call my friend and we would watch it together . we had a few beers and we had fun .   you will not find any deep message in this movie ,  but it's worth watching .   so ,  lay back and just enjoy . 
i have to hand it to the creative team behind these  " american pie "  movies .   " direct to dvd "  typically is synonymous with cheap ,  incompetent film-making .  yet last year i was pleasantly surprised when i found myself thoroughly enjoying the dvd sequel  " the naked mile "  .  the filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a raunchy ,  yet funny little film .  this year they offer up the followup ,   " beta house "  .  this is the honest truth ,   " beta house "  makes the first few  " american pie "  movies look like  " the little mermaid "  .   this is no holds barred ,  tasteless ,  laugh-out loud fun .  sure ,  the story is a bit thin ,  but that's the beauty of the whole thing .  within the first 10 minutes we're introduced to the all the main characters ,  the new supporting characters ,  get a handful of raunchy gags ,  meet the villains ,  and establish the general plot-line .  with all that out of the way ,  the movie becomes a no-limits ride .  the gags are a plenty ,  and they did not hold back in this one .  i'm talking male semen ,  urine ,  dildos ,  chicks-with-dicks ,  sex with sheep ,  female orgazim sprays ,  and plenty more .  not to mention the fact that not a minute goes by without boobs or a sex scene .   returning from  " the naked mile "  are john white ,  jake siegel ,  steve talley ,  and eugene levy  ( in a similar supporting role as the last few films )  .  the entire cast does fine work .  steve talley  ( dwight stifler )  ,  in particular ,  has a great energy and screen presence .  i predict good things for him .  the film is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open .  by far the biggest laugh of the film for me was  " the deerhunter "  parody .  classic .   the bottom line is ,  if you're a fan of the series ,  you'll feel right at home with  " beta house "  .  it really pushes the limits of good taste ,  but in the end is pretty damn funny . 
always enjoy the great acting of drew barrymore and her great performance in this film ,  where she plays a very very complicated young gal ,  ( holly gooding )  ,  " skipped parts "  , 2000 ,  who leaves new york and travels to california and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer ,  george newbern ,  ( patrick highsmith )  ,  " far harbor "  , '96 .  many strange things start to happen to holly and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father .  if you look close enough you will actually see the mother of drew barrymore in real life appear as her mother in this picture .  if it was not for the good acting of drew barrymore and george newbern ,  this film should be seen only on halloween night !  however ,  it sure has it's surprises in the end !  !  !  ! 
there is a certain genius behind this movie .  i was laughing throughout .  the scene in the phone sex office ,  discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius/humor .  execution is poor ,  but you can see the writer's message and they do have some talent .  the doppelganger split at the end was like .  .  .   " ok ,  wasn't quite expecting that but let's see what the movie has to say "  .  certainly ridiculous ,  but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way .   is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level ?  i'm easily bored by many movies ,  but this one kept my interest throughout .   i think the story may have some auto-biographical roots ,  but that's just a guess .  horribly bad ,  but good .  i'm looking for other movies this person may have done  ( with more experience )  . 
this film is fantastic .  finally well-written characters you can love for all their good and bad .  pierce brosnan is flat-out hysterical in this self-effacing role .  i think its the best thing he's ever done .  he's done other roles that exhibited shades of being capable of this kind of fully-fledged work ,  but this role finally gave him the room to run with it .  i almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots .  and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to aspire too ,  as well as actors to aspire too .  kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying .  you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back . 
drew barrymore was excellent in this film .  this role is the type of role you don't normally see drew play .  her typical role is as a woman looking for love .  the storyline is also great .   when holly is implicated in her mother's murder she moves to l . a .  she moves in with a guy who becomes her lover .  but her brother who is in a mental prison hospital for what they believe is murder is almost killed she is wrongfully accused .  it is then revealed to her lover that she has multiple personality disorder .  after that another woman becomes paranoid when she's around her .  in the end though ,  they find out the truth . 
when two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of breakfast at tiffany's ,  you know something is going to go right .  drew barrymore ,  patrick highsmith ,  leslie hope ,  and sally kellerman are excellent actors .  the fbi agent was a terrible actor .  the scenes where patrick looked holly up and down like some sort of objectifier ,  those was just weird .  drew barrymore is very hot .  intimate strangers ,  where sally kellerman worked ,  was a great part .  the weird gummy worm was just weird .  nathan was a very handsome cat .  but what was that scene where patrick followed holly into a cesspool and mr .  gooding attacked him ?  and the scene with dr .  wallace ?  what was he doing fumbling around in there ?  and not every male has a female ,  as sally kellerman stated .  and when patrick and elizabeth saw drew outside of victor's ,  that was weird . 
i liked it !  the plot was weird ,  drew barrymore and dc making out was awkward for both of them .  drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time .  dennis christopher as the shrink was pretty cool ,  and as always he does his best - i'm a major dennis fan anyway ,  that's why i bought the dvd .   i didn't get the ending !  that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool ,  which is ok i guess but it could have been more .     .  .  .  . and the whole thing with the knife- if it was that uncomfortable why didn't they just get rid of it ?    it was very confusing as to when it was the doppelganger weird thing or when it was dc-or was it dennis all the time ?  because the doppelganger made out with dennis and patrick .  in the scenes with patrick if it was dennis as the doppelganger then i think patrick would notice .   the music was ok but obtrusive in places ,  the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone .   a big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of drew nude .    all in all a bit of a gpm-guilty pleasure movie .  don't read too much into it ,  don't look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wont find it .  there are some diamond moments and goofs galore- watch it and just have a bit of fun with it ! 
the movie follows the events of the novel  " cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni "  (  could be translated as  " the most beloved among humans "   )  ,  written by marin preda  (  a very controversial book and movie )  ,  a novel which became something like the bible or the story of hamlet ,  very popular and hard to get ,  due to its satiric contents over the communist regime .  it represents the drama of the intellectual man ,  the humanist ,  in a  " red "  world .  a movie filled with passion ,  fear ,  sexuality ,  all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe . one of the greatest romanian movies , despite its psychological charge ( after all ,  it is an european movie )  . 
i do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers out of romania .  this tells something certainly about the value ,  or maybe about the lack of universality of the film ,  but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in romania compared to other countries ,  even in eastern europe .   the film is an adaptation of a novel by marin preda ,  a controversial novelist who died during the communist rule soon after the book was published .  it tells the story of an intellectual ,  professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after he is imprisoned on false accusations at the end of the stalinist era .  basically the first part of the film tells the story of his fight for survival in prison ,  the second describes his tentative to regain his life after being released .  his release is actually only apparent ,  romania of the 60s asks from him different types of compromises and crimes ,  but yet his fight for survival is as tough morally as in prison .   the film is splendidly acted by some of the best romanian actors .  stefan iordache who has the lead role would be in another time and another place a mega-star ,  we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art .  although suffering from a hesitant story-telling and falling sometimes in non-essential details or character comics ,  the film is still an important landmark for the romanian cinema ,  as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the romanian society . 
if you like animal movies ,  this movie will please .  my wife likes animals and animal movies ,  she especially like the parrot in this film .  it is geared towards kids ,  but i laughed at most of the humor .  the french fashion character made me laugh ,  and adds balance to the script .  it is a disney film ,  with its sappy ,  happily ,  family apeal ,  but i like leaving the theater with a positive fealing . 
i really like 101 dalmations when it came out in 1996 ,  now 5 years later i went to see 102 dalmations in 2001 ,  i thought it was fantastic but i think 101 is better because i think it's more funnier ,  more humor ,  and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version  ( one hundred and one dalmations  ( 1961 )  i wonder if there are plans for 103 dalmations .  i hope there is ,  maybe yes ,  maybe no ,  all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future . 
i enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time .  don't take the film all too seriously because remember it's disney and it's rated g .  it's good clean fun although some parts may be recognised by adults but children would never notice ,  particularly the  " triangle "  between cruella ,  le pelt ,  and cruella's faithful valet alonso .  glenn close is fantastic and really has made cruella her own and is believably terrifying even when she is  " cured "  of her fur loving ways ,  she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills that literally shake the theater .   ( i even found myself jumping in my seat when she catches you by surprise with her 'bipolarity' as the dog loving ella .  )  all in all i will go see it again in theaters ,  i found myself enjoying it so much . 
the delivery of some very humorous rude lines by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission .  he plays a kind of  " james bond's psycho twin brother "  ,  separated at birth ,  no doubt .  as an intense hit-man ,  his character is very sexual but even better ,  very funny .  add the kind-hearted ,  uber-likable american  " guy next door' ,  greg kinnear ,  to set up contrast .  the myriad locations ,  vivid colors ,  and quick-witted humor provide great entertainment .  hope davis is well cast as the  " gem of a wife "  .  but the focus of the film is on the two fellows ,  a new  " odd couple "  ,  and that's the part that works very well .  have a great  ( probably r-rated )  laugh ,  and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper . 
while this was a better movie than 101 dalmations  ( live action ,  not animated version )  ,  i think it still fell a little short of what disney could do .  it was well-filmed ,  the music was more suited to the action ,  and the effects were better done  ( compared to 101 )  .  the acting was perhaps better ,  but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel ,  and glenn close is really not to be missed ,  as in the first movie .  she makes it shine .  her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of ,  and they add to the spectacle disney has given us .  this is a great family film ,  with little or no objectionable material ,  and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike .  it's bound to be a classic ,  as so many disney films are .  here's to hoping the third will be even better still- because you know they probably want to make one .   ;  ) 
this is just as good as the original 101 if not better .  of course ,  cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits ,  and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of cruella .  we see a lot more of her this time round .  i also like ioan gruffudd as kevin ,  the rather bumbling male lead .  to use paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea .  the movie is well worth watching whatever your age ,  provided you like animals . 
i noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on dodie smith's novel .  in any case ,  it was a nice idea that pongo and perdita's son now had his own puppies .  the cutest of the dalmatians was ,  of course ,  little snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film .    to be honest ,  i didn't know what to think when cruella de vil seemed to have changed completely kind .  in fact i have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly ,  but now that she so quickly changed into  " herself "  again and announced that she was cruella once more ,  i almost began to be really worried about chloe's dalmatians .   actually ,  the scene in which the puppies watched lady and the tramp while chloe and kevin had their dinner ,  was much better than i had expected .  i also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog ,  and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie .    of course i was content that at the end the dalmatians were saved again ,  but i would have liked to know what was going to happen to cruella after she had lost her whole property .  and what on earth could the dogs' home do with such a huge sum of money ?   finally ,  it was quite touching that snowball also had spots at the very end of the film . 
arguably this is a very good  " sequel "  ,  better than the first live action film 101 dalmatians .  it has good dogs ,  good actors ,  good jokes and all right slapstick !    cruella devil ,  who has had some rather major therapy ,  is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them .  many ,  including chloe simon ,  owner of one of the dogs that cruella once tried to kill ,  do not believe this .  others ,  like kevin shepherd  ( owner of 2nd chance dog shelter )  believe that she has changed .    meanwhile ,  dipstick ,  with his mate ,  have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies !  little dipper ,  domino and oddball .  .  .   starring eric idle as waddlesworth  ( the hilarious macaw )  ,  glenn close as cruella herself and gerard depardieu as le pelt  ( another baddie ,  the name should give a clue )  ,  this is a good family film with excitement and lots more !  !  one downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick ,  but not quite as excessive as the last film .  this is also funnier than the last film .   enjoy  " 102 dalmatians "  !   : - ) 
the first film was a nice one ,  but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing .  this sequel is inferior ,  but not bad at all .  sure the slapstick is too much ,  the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired .  but the dogs are very cute here ,  and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw .  the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes ( especially cruella's )  ,  and the music is pleasant .  the acting is mostly very good ,  ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruella's accomplice .  but the best asset ,  as it was with the first film ,  is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as cruella ,  even more evil than she was previously .  overall ,  nice .  7/10 bethany cox
in 1996's  " 101 dalmatians ,  "  cruella de vil was arrested by the london metropolitain police  ( god bless them )  for attempting to steal and murder 101 puppies - dalmatians .  all covered in mud and hay ,  she spent the next 4 years in the  " tin can .  "  now ,  4 years later ,  she ,  unfortunately ,  was released from the jail .  i say ,  that's about 28 years - in dog years !  !  !  !  !   so ,  in 2000 ,  disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live-action version of the classic film and it is hereby dubbed  " 102 dalmatians .  "  in it ,  there is a 102nd dalmatian added to the family  ( oddball is the name ,  i think ;  i should know this since this was just shown on tv recently )  ,  and the puppy had no spots !  !  !  !  !  also ,  while cruella  ( again played by glenn close )  has escaped again ,  she wanted a bigger ,  better coat - made once again out of the puppies !  !  !  !  !   i especially liked the theme song - i'm sure everybody loves the  " atomic dog "  song from the 70s or so .  and now ,  we hear a bit of it in this movie !  !  !  !  !    " 102 dalmatians "  is such a great film that i keep on wondering - when will there be a  " 103 dalmatians ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  "  lol  10 stars
enormous fun for both adults and children ,  this film works on numerous levels :  there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good  ( yet subtle )  jokes for adults .   glenn close is at her sublimely evil best as cruella  ( `call me ella' )  de ville .   after three years in dr .  pavlov's behaviour modification clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppy-skin fur she had so intensely desired .  she even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits .   but it wouldn't be a dalmatian' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification .  and now she needs one extra puppy  ( hence 102 dalmatians )  to complete her nefarious scheme this time round .   ioan gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the `second chance' dog shelter .  though he was in `titanic' and in last year's television version  ( as pip )  of `great expectations' i didn't recognize him ;  well ,  he was fifth officer lowe' in `titanic' and i didn't see `great expectations' so i am not terribly surprised .   gerard depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier-pawn of cruella .  he prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well .  his 'wicked witch of the west' homage is hilarious .   tim mcinnerny is superb is cruella's not-so-evil henchman  he was also alonzo , ' cruella's butler ,  in `101 dalmatians' and you may also recognize him from all of the `black adder' brit-coms .  he plays his usual bumbling ,  good-hearted ,  somewhat dim-witted character to great effect .   oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film .  this is unfortunate as the clothing worn by glenn close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed  ( note her handcuffs when she is being released from the behaviour modification clinic )  and worthy of such an over-the-top character .  her clothing alone deserves at least an oscar nomination .   animation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans :  it can't be done .  suffice it to say that `102 dalmatians' is even better than the film version of `101 dalmatians' that came out in 1996 .  there is a lot to like here :  from the sight gags ,  the dialogue ,  and the costumes to the casting - it is a good film for the whole family . 
this is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it ,  it has lot's of laughs ,  guns ,  action ,  crime ,  ,  good one liners ,  and a decent plot ,  with an over the top ,  donald sutherland in a rather comedic role as an assasain .  tia carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too ,  thomas ian griffin is great in this as the lead character  " max "  a dea agent diane is the fbi agent ,  played by carerra ,  and john lithgow from frazier on tv ,  plays the bad guy ,  ,   " livingston "  .  the plot centers around max and diane trying to capture livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies ,  throw into the mix the assassain sutherland ,  who pretty much has all the good one liners ,  this is the perfect crime caper ,  there is the usual love story ,  ,  but played very differently than you would think by carerra and griffith .  you also have the russian mafia ,  italian mafia ,  and chineese mafia here thrown into the mix ,  ,  the film is shot in boston ,  ,  where you have some great shots  ,  and locals ,  ,  great photography and music in this film ,  this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy ,  ,  it has everything that one could ever want .  check out sutherland's toilet in a particular scene ,  ,  very unusual .  this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me . 
hollow point ,  though clumsy in places ,  manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie .   the primary entertainment value here is humor - everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of energy .   oh ,  by the way ,  advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie .  .  . 
i think hollow point is a funny film with some good moments i have never seen before in action movies .  well , both tia carrere and thomas ian griffith aren't so good in acting ,  but tia carrere is nice and good looking girl ,  isn't it ?  but donald sutherland is superb in his role so-so mad gangster . 
this film is one of the finest american b-movies of the 90s .  if you're looking for a serious film ,  look elsewhere .  however ,  if you're looking for some action ,  a lot of laughs ,  and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters ,  this is well worth watching .  everyone chews the scenery a bit ,  but that's really what the film is all about ,  and everyone is quite funny .  donald sutherland and john lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together . 
greetings again from the darkness .  much anticipated ,  twisted comedy from writer/director richard shepard is a coming out party for pierce brosnan the actor .  that bond guy is gone .  this new guy is something else entirely !  !  have read that shepard thought brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role ,  but brosnan proves to be the perfect julian noble ,   " facilitator "   .  .  .  and is anything but pretty !  do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one .  if you go ,  expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex ,  killing ,  religion ,  sports ,  business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect .  brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements .  even sitting on a hotel bed  ( with or without a sombrero )  is a joy to behold .   greg kinnear is the straight guy to brosnan's comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click .  hope davis has a small ,  but subtly effective supporting role as kinnear's wife  ( what's with her name  " bean "  ?  )  who happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room .   the visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight ,  racetrack and denver suburb .  and how often do we get the killers and xavier cugat on the same soundtrack ?  this one is definitely not for everyone ,  but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy risky film-making ,  it could be for you . 
the plot :  a crime lord is uniting 3 different mafias in an entreprise to buy an island ,  that would then serve as money-laundering facility for organized crime .  to thwart that ,  the fbi tries to bust one of the mafia lords .  the thing goes wrong ,  and by some unlikely plot twists and turns ,  we are presented with another  " cop buddies who don't like each other "  movie .  .  .  one being a female fbi agent ,  and the other a male ex-dea agent .   so far ,  so stupid .  but the strength of this movie does not lie in its story - a poor joke ,  at best .  it is funny .   ( at least the synchronized german version is )  .  the action is good ,  too ,  with a memorable scene involving a shot gun and a rocket launcher .  but the focus is squarely on the humour .  not intelligent satire ,  not quite slapstick ,  but somewhere in between ,  you get a lot of funny jokes .    however ,  this film is the opposite of political correctness .  legal drug abuse is featured prominently ,  without criticism ,  and even displaying it as cool .  that's the bit of the movie that seriously annoyed me ,  and renders it unsuitable for kids ,  in my opinion .    all in all ,  for a nice evening watching come acceptable action with some funny jokes ,  this movie is perfect .  just remember :  in this genre ,  it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / tv room .  then you'll have a good time .  8/10
the only thing serious about this movie is the humor .  well worth the rental price .  i'll bet you watch it twice .  it's obvious that sutherland enjoyed his role . 
this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time .  all of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer .  it shows us that real life and  " ficticious "  action can produce a winning combination .  also ,  as a romantic comedy ,  it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other .  name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as donald sutherland singing a song like  " they're going to find your anus on a mountain on mars .  " 
love the characters and the story line .  very funny with plenty of action .  thomas ian griffith and tia carrer give great performances .  i enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of griffith and career .  donald southerland plays a very likable ,  and surprisingly sympathetic ,  burnt out hit man .  all three actors are among my favorites and having them in this movie made for a special treat .  a nice addition to my extensive dvd collection .  i highly recommend this movie .  if you like .  .  .  mr .  and mrs .  smith ,  the replacement killers ,  l . a .  confidential ,  the long kiss goodnight ,  the abyss and ,  the whole nine yards .  .  .  you will love this movie . 
the korean war has been dubbed americas's forgotten war .  so many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50 thousand men who died there .  occasionally ,  we are treated to a play or movie which deals with that far-off ,  ghostly frozen graveyard .  here is perhaps one of the finest .  it's called  "  sergeant ryker .   "  the story is of an american soldier named sgt .  paul ryker  ( lee marvin )  who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer .  his task is to defect to the north koreans and offer his services against united nations forces .  so successful is his cover ,  he proves invaluable to the enemy and given the rank of major .  however ,  he is thereafter captured by the americans ,  put on trial as a traitor and spy .  stating he was ordered to defect ,  he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence .  he is convicted and sentenced to hang .  however ,  his conviction is doubted by capt .  young  ( bradford dillman )  ,  his prosecutor .  convincing commanding gen .  amos baily ,   ( lloyd nolan )  of his doubts ,  he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed .  the courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes peter graves ,  murray hamilton and norman fell as sgt .  max winkler .  korea was a far off place but the possibility of convicting a communist and hanging him hit very close to home in the 1950's .  due to its superior script and powerful message ,  this drama has become a courtroom classic .  excellent viewing and recommended to all .  ****
sergeant ryker is accused of being a traitor during the korean war ,  a hanging offense .  a long drawn out court-marshal ensues during which time the sgt .  must remain in a military jail .  after much investigation the defense attorney attempts to exonerate the doomed non-com with an eleventh hour ploy .  very good picture . 
engaging ,  riveting tale of captured us army turncoat who has to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman .  paul ryker dodges friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a us spy on a secret mission in korea .   in the vein of classic courtroom dramas ,   " sergeant ryker "  is an extremely well crafted mystery ,  ably guided by an outstanding cast ,  director kulik's constant momentum ,  and effective plot twists and turns .   this film was originally made as a television movie in 1964 ,  and subsequently beefed up for this revision with the presence of many  " name "  actors ,  and some action sequences .  dillman ,  reprising his role ,  is spot-on as the doubting defence attorney ,  whose attentions sometimes stray to the personal plight of ryker's supportive ,  yet somewhat distant wife ,  played with aplomb by vera miles .  rounding out the frontline is peter graves for the prosecution ,  and norman fell and murray hamilton in key supporting roles .   marvin's interpretation of the paul ryker character is a balanced depiction of a simple but dedicated man whose normally laid back demeanour is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he's placed .  marvin switches perfectly from resigned indifference ,  to passionate determination ,  giving a convincing ,  often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise small-scale drama .  it's this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it occupies a place on the best-ever lists of courtroom dramas .   however ,  despite its apparent obscurity ,   " sergeant ryker "  still remains a taut and compelling examination ,  like a book that you just can't put down .  highly recommended . 
welcome back kiefer sutherland .  it's been too long since you've appeared in a movie ,  ,  and what a movie this was ,  was it 24 no ,  ,  but very intriguing ,  especially with a pro like michael douglas in the lead as the embattled secret service agent .  kiefer's character is the one chasing michael douglas the whole movie ,  ,  kiefer's partner ,  ,  is eva longoria ,  ,  the desperate houswife .  wow she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good ,  ,  i wish though that kim bassinger had a bigger role ,  ,  but other than that ,  i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish .  this movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller ,  everybody played their part to the hilt .  nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie ,  ,  so as to keep you guessing at all times .  and i really think that kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie ,  ,  but in my opinion michael douglas had the besxt performance of the day ,  ,  thumbs up . 
my take :  makes use of its familiar plot with fine performances and a few genuine moments of excitement .    the plot is familiar .  an innocent man is framed for a plot to assassinate the president of the united states ,  the first traitor in the united states secret service .  as his fellow secret-service agents pursue him ,  he tries to prove his innocence .  of course we know his innocent ,  and the real culprit is just around the corner ,  but i was still entertained by the sentinel .  in this time where thrillers are reduced to being too ludicrous and too abundant in action sequences ,  the sentinel is a good lick-back to all those good old-fashioned political crime thriller .  the familiar plot is elevated by neat thrilling sequences and terrific performances .   michael douglas ,  the perfect man for the job ,  is long-running secret service agent pete garrison ,  who is framed for being part of a plot to assassinate the president .  former colleagues in the secret service  ( kiefer sutherland and eva longoria )  pursue harrison while he tries to find out who is behind the possible assassination and the traitor in the secret service .  this leads to a lot of chase scenes that ,  surprisingly  ( and thankfully )  ,  are never unbelievable .  the screenplay also offers a subplot involving garrison having an affair with the first lady  ( played by kim basinger )  .  this thankfully wasn't unnecessary like most subplots are to these kinds of films .   the films director is clark johnson  ( s . w . a . t .  )  who manages to make the film look good .  although many have criticized it as  " should have been a tv movie "  ,  i must disagree .  agreed ,  this is not a perfect film ,  and much of it is inspired from other action thrillers and political intrigues like in the line of fire or an episode from the tv series 24  ( which this film closely resembles when it comes to style and star sutherland )  ,  but even so ,  this film takes its plot into serious heights and doesn't abandon even its smaller details .  the performances are terrific  ( with a top-notch cast ,  its bound to be ,  even with the by-the-numbers script .   all-in-all ,  i award it ***1/2 ,  not perfect ,  but not far from it .   rating :  ***1/2 out of 5 . 
it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about . the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate .  the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this :  a plot to kill the president of the united states .  michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed . kiefer sutherland co-stars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine .  one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president , it also concerns a mole ( traitor )  in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction . 
this film has a rotting core of flexible morality ,  and yet a quirky sense of justice .  so many of the regular joes among us would love to  " stick it to the man "  .  the  " man "  in this case is represented by several different characters .  mr .  keller ,  who carla reports to at her office .  later ,  paul owes 70 large to mr .  marchand the club owner .  and then there is paul's parole officer .  there seems to be so much question about this last character's side story .  reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of ping-pong between our two protagonists ,  escalating tit-for-tat until their lives change dramatically .  they are beholden to each agent of the  " man "  .  one or both could be fired ,  killed ,  or imprisoned if they don't do as they are told .   the film has a sense of relief at the end .  carla finally gets laid .  her boss is forced out for being a jerk .  mr .  club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom .  they get the $money$ .  and .  .  .  they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer ,  because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement  ( or whatever the police found to arrest him )  .  it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight .  never mind that someone else may get paul's file later to supervise his release ;  for the moment they are free !  they might even get away with it !    woohoo .  .  .   they stuck it to the man ! 
i'll be honest , i finally checked this movie not because of the stars--though they were reasonably watchable and compelling , particularly the three leads--or even the compelling story of a breach in the presidential secret service ( something , i've been informed through the dvd extras of this show , has yet to ever happen . assuming that's true , that's remarkable !  )  .  i got it because it was directed and has a choice cameo by none other than detective meldrick lewis !  !  well , okay , clark johnson , one of my faves from  " homicide : life on the street "  and a veteran  ( mostly )  tv director .  i'd say that he does about as good as he can with a project that is watchable but pretty average , despite the possibilities .   veteran and ace secret agent pete garrison ( michael douglass ) has to find out both who is blackmailing him and who killed his friend , targeted and blew up an air force one chopper and is gunning for the prez .  ( david rasche .  anyone remember  " sledgehammer "  ?  )  .  his affair with the first lady ( kim basinger , clearly one of the hotter first ladies we've ever had , fictional or real ) is certainly not helping his standing .  he's got to both ferret out the real mole in the service and avoid the hound dog like hunting of his former best friend and fellow agent and chief ( kiefer sutherland , almost still completely in  " 24 "  mode )  .  throw in some other pivotal service agents ( martin donovan and the foxy , somewhat hard to buy as the gig eva longorria )  and shady foreign characters and you have a fairly standard political thriller that doesn't aim as high as it purports and reaches the desired , if underwhelming , results .   the summary line is about the best way to describe how this show plays out without giving spoilers .  the dvd extras to me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie , though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most  ( myself included )  interested . 
seeing as keifer sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of tv ,  it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend $15 on this .  i also think this applies to eva longoria fans .   the movie revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president .  as the investigation unfolds ,  it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated pete  ( michael douglas )  .  pleading innocence ,  pete goes on the fun ,  fugitive style ,  to search for the truth .   it's solid ,  but certainly not spectacular .  a decent cast ,  a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty ,  but you could certainly do far worse . 
this was a pretty decent movie .  this movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained .  just a typical hollywood film .  this movie will never win an oscar or anything and definitely doesn't deserve one ,  but i thought it was pretty good .  it's kind of like the show 24 but set into movie format .  if you like the whole we've got to stop the terrorist from killing the president kind of movie then you will enjoy this flick .  i personally think that storyline has been done way too much ,  but the sentinel does add a little twist with the mole in the secret service .  all in all ,  this movie won't leave your jaw to the floor or change your life ,  but who says every single movie has to be like that to be good ? 
good for an evening's entertainment - but the plot was unconvincing .  garrison's affair with the first lady was unreal and passionless ;  the president was a cardboard cut-out .  and who were the real villains anyway ?  nothing was developed or explained sufficiently .  i still don't know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved .  the villains were nameless and undeveloped ,  so you never felt involved in their plot .  michael douglas and kiefer sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story - the chase and confrontation were good .  but kim basinger and eva longoria were both unbelievable in their roles ,  basinger totally lacked character and no way could longoria have been a secret service agent .  this could have been a very good film but somehow it missed the way ,  with too many unanswered questions .  disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes .  and did they use the 'west wing' set for the white house scenes ?  - i kept expecting cj or charlie to appear ! 
the sentinel features a sort of run of the mill and clichéd suspense/mystery but is lifted with some good acting and taut pacing .  these stories have already for the most part gone through as many permutations as we can bear ,  so what we're left with is how good is the acting ,  how smart are the setups and bad guys ,  how well crafted is the main plot etc etc .  .  .  .  . so the sentinel does a solid job given it's content .  michael douglass and kiefer sutherland both maintain some good screen bravado and attitudes .  eva longoria  ( first time i've seen her on screen )  brings some satisfactory support .  the whole affair side of the story is utterly implausible knocking it down a bit ,  but it deserves slack .  worth a viewing if you like the genre . 
the sentinel i was hoping would be a good film and boy i was right . a great story first of all from a novel and i thought this was an original story but i guess it wasn't and it was a very smart story .  michael douglas in this film is very good and keither sutherland is too , but however it is very hard to shrug him off his role as jack bauer in 24 but eventually you do and he is very different in the sentinel than he is in 24 . also another person trying to shrug off their tv role but failed . eva longeria . she wasn't that good in the film and had a back seat in the entire thing . after i saw the film i had constant dreams about the sentinel and couldn't sleep . overall sentinel is a good film and i would recommend it . 
i can admit that the screenplay isn't very good ,  and that it has some slow parts ,  but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun .  first of all ,  the performances are great  ( michael douglas ,  kim basinger ,  kiefer sutherland ,  and eva longoria .  michael douglas proves he has still got it ,  and kim basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife .  kiefer sutherland and eva longoria ,  play the dynamic duo ,  both adding their incredible talent to the pot .  and second of all ,  this movie is the most fun i have had in years in a theodore .  its plain and simple ,  if you want to go to the movies ,  and have a lot of fun see ,  the sentinel . 
i thought that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie . when i finally saw it , i took a good surprise . the movie isn't great thing but it's very fun and the action scenes are very well done . this movie reminded me tv series like 24 or alias . it's very similar to that series and it reminded me too , to the wolfgang petersen's thriller in the line of fire . if you're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies , you will be disappointed . but if you go with little expectations , you will enjoy the sentinel .   rating : 7
i enjoyed this film .  i thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that's never happened before - a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot .  unfortunately ,  for michael douglas' character ,   " pete garrison ,  "  they think he's the mole but he isn't .    he's just a morally-flawed agent having an affair with the first lady !  since he's doing that ,  he's unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it's revealed there is a plot to kill the president .    " garrison "  is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he's still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president .  douglas does a fine job in this role .  i don't always care the people he plays but he's an excellent actor .  keifer sutherland  (  " david breckinridge "  )  is equally as good  ( at least in here )  as the fellow ss boss who hunts down douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth .  when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop ,  if they can ,  the plot .  the crooks are interesting ,  too ,  by the way .  also ,  i have never - and never will ,  unfortunately - see a first lady who looks as good as kim basinger  this is simply a slick action flick that entertains start-to-finish .  are there holes in it ?  of course ;  probably a number of them ,  and a reason you see so many critical comments .  however ,  it is unfairly bashed here .  it just isn't intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website .  my advice :  chill ,  just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue .  yes ,  it gets a little rambo-ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment .  .  .  .  . which is what movies are all about . 
at first glance ,  this film looks like the keifer sutherland series 24 for the big screen .  with the focus on a plot to assassinate the president of the united states ,  a race against time ,  and plenty of secret service agents ,  the agency under the spotlight in the sentinel .   but wait ,  the protagonist turns out to be michael douglas' character pete garrison instead ,  a veteran secret service agent famed for taking the bullet for reagan in 1981 .  the ss agents are specially trained to  " take the bullet "  ,  which is what makes them special - who in the right mind will put themselves in the line of a bullet and a target ?  but garrison gets implicated in the assassination plot ,  and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot .  all this because of his failure in a polygraph test ,  due to his adulterous banging of the first lady  ( kim basinger )  .  tsk .   there are shades of clint eastwood's in the line of fire .  both featured aging actors ,  and aging veteran has-been heroes with a bit of a historical reference ,  who took the bullet in their respective tours of duty .  while eastwood's movie has a more enigmatic villain in john malkovich ,  the sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain ,  preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex-kgb villains ,  and the mole within the presidential detail .  with douglas on the run from the law ,  he becomes similar to dr .  richard kimble of the fugitive ,  hunting the proverbial one-armed man while at the same time ,  relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents ,  which turned out to be quite interesting to watch - despite slick processes ,  it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents .   keifer sutherland and eva longoria ,  top tv stars of today from 24 and desperate housewives ,  get relegated into support roles as the secret service investigators who are looking into garrison's probable involvement in the assassination plot ,  and at times seem to have lept off the pages of csi with their forensics skills .  the beautiful couple had chemistry that could have resembled x-files' fox mulder and dana scully ,  but alas these two had very little to do here .  we know the reason why they're in the movie ,  and that is to get their fans into the theatres .  also ,  longoria's role seemed unable to shake off her sexy-mama gabrielle ,  and here ,  has her in fairly low cut blouses  ( sutherland actually tells her to cover up )  and tight pants  ( ogle-fest for fellow agents )  .   nonetheless ,  it's still a pretty interesting look into the lives of probably the most highly charged and tense protection detail in the world ,  and the typical threats that they face daily ,  including the following up on every nutcase's threat on the life of the most powerful man in the world .  it's a decent suspense and investigative thriller ,  with enough subplots to keep you entertained .  but one thing though ,  like most ending action sequences ,  this one has a big enough loophole for you to fly a jumbo jet through . 
it's been 19 years since gordon gekko used  " wall street "  to let us know that greed is good .  now ,  michael douglas takes the gg persona and morphs it into a secret service agent ,  pete garrison .  guess what ?  it works !  this is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing .  the detail work in showing the security precautions taken by the ss on behalf of the president and first lady was likewise intriguing .  all the leads were pretty good but ,  try as i might ,  i could not accept eva longoria as a secret service agent .  whereas jodie foster just made you suspend belief and really think she was fbi agent starling in  " silence of the lambs "  ,  you do not get the same feeling with longoria .  nevertheless ,  this is a fun film ,  escapist entertainment with the beltway as the backdrop . 
it's so rare to find a film that provides a plot that can't be figured out at every turn .  surprises throughout delighting throughout .   a couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays  " the good girl ,  hard worker "  and yet in the end she ends up being an anti-social risk taker .  that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pause .   the other thing i could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film .  i never did get who he was or what his issues were .  if anyone has any ideas ,  i'd like to hear what they might be .   the film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing .  very much worth seeing . 
there was some hesitation from my part about what this movie had to offer .  for starters ,  the casting didn't seem right .  kiefer sutherland had already done very well in  " 24 "  and the preview didn't seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience .  eva longoria appeared out of place ,  and the rest didn't seem very interesting .   when the film finally ended ,  i was not completely displeased for i had seen a decent thriller that could have been much better ,  had the responsible parties taken a little more care to watch for the narrative gaps and given a little more care to character development .  we have seen threats of this type before ,  and that made the main conflict much more challenging to the writers .  as an audience ,  we don't want to sit through the same old story again .  we want to see something different ,  be thrilled and entertained .   there is nothing wrong with the casting .  from kim basinger's delicious first lady .  she carries herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the part memorable .  michael douglas has been and done that before .  unfortunately ,  the president is much of a non entity to even care about his fate .  sutherland rehashes his  " 24 "  tough guy approach with enough power to make it big enough for the big screen ,  and eva does a passable job ,  as the newcomer .   don't expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics  (  " north by northwest "  and  " the fugitive "  come to mind )  .  leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it might be .  it's o . k . 
my observations :  vamp outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful ,  exotic and fantastic .  jeanette wore it well ,  and got even with naive nelson .  boat crashing into his balcony served him right .  costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well ,  especially by today's standards .  1942 costume designer did great job .  main song theme just lovely .   caution to negative posters :  1942 was time of ww ii ;  pearl harbor happened year before .  u . s .  just coming out of great depression ;  needed to get out and spend that hard earned money on diversion of singing ,  dance and yes ,  fantastic fantasy .  despotic dictators were trying to rule out there in rl ,  snuffing out freedoms .  thank goodness the public had these fantastic plot line movies to attend .  movie going was a privileged treat ,  in those depressing times .  when you ,  negative posters ,  become actors or even movie stars ,  then you have room to talk and criticize .  jeanette's and nelson's movies stand the test of time .   angel wings wonderful ,  on the real angel .  rl wings at costume party not so hot ,  but great on jeanette considering the sl .   beautiful singing by jeanette and nelson ,  as always .  jeanette dancing was a pure delight .   15/10
one used to say ,  concerning nathaniel hawthorne ,  that his failures were more interesting than his successes .  i believe that the same remark could suit to mcdonald-eddy's pictures .  and especially this one .    it apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie :  it's kitsch ,  the script ,  because of censorship ,  sounds inconsistent yet ,  this movie gets also some good points :  good rodgers-hart's music  (  " i married an angel "  ,   " tira tira tira la "  )  ,  good acting with e . e . horton and reginald owen .    anyway ,  if you may dislike it ,  you can't forget it .  this strange movie actually leaves a very strong ,  dreamlike ,  impression ,  and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days ,  maybe for weeks .  why ?  in the thirties and the beginning of the forties ,  movies didn't have the same mean than today :  it aimed ,  like a dream ,  to divert the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality .  of all the the dream-movies that was made ,  in that time ,  this one stands as particularly powerful .   in short ,  let's say that the better way to appreciate this movie ,  is to watch it without wondering whether it's good or bad .  to watch it ,  like you would watch a dream . 
the movie is a fantasy .  the story line is thin but serves as the structure upon which some wonderful songs are sung and sung beautifully .   ( i still cannot believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing this well .  )  some of the dialog is wonderfully clever .  the costumes made me feel as though i was watching a haute couture fashion show from 1942 .   movies are designed to serve various purposes .  this one is designed to entertain and it certainly does .  if i have one negative comment it would be that nelson eddy was a little too old to be the handsome dashing count .  some of the closeups made me uncomfortable .  but he could still sing and sing magnificently .  however ,  jeanette macdonald was just as dazzling as ever .  she makes a spectacular angel .   this genre is well before my time ,  and i an new to the jeanette macdonald/nelson eddy films and related conversation .  the music in this movie is beautiful .  as much as i love the classic rock music which fills most modern movies ,  there is no question in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable ,  more delightful ,  better constructed .  the stars in this movie are more talented than the stars i see in the movie theaters today .  and jeanette macdonald ,  without the benefit of beverly hills plastic surgeons ,  was more beautiful than the stars i see today .  i am unclear as to why so many other posters are apologetic about liking this movie and more generally this group of movies .  they say it is dated and try to explain why it is the way it is .  and those that do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what ?  i think this movie will doubtless still be entertaining people when so many other movie are long forgotten .  there is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed .  i recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent ,  great beauty and great music . 
i know a lot of people don't like this movie ,  but i just think it is adorable .  there's not much i can say ,  but the movie is a feel-good movie i guess .  the songs are beautiful ,  the costumes are beautiful ,  the voices are beautiful ,  and there are a lot of funny lines in the movie ,  especially as briggitta learns about the do's and don't's of society .  if you like musicals ,  i'd say you'd like this one ! 
jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy star in this  " modern "  musical that showcases macdonald's comic abilities .  surreal 40s musical seem to be making fun of 40s fashions even as they were in current vogue .  eye-popping costumes and sets  ( yes b&w )  add to the surreal ,  dreamlike quality of the entire film .  several good songs enliven the film ,  with the  " twinkle in your eye "  number a total highlight ,  including a fun jitterbug number between macdonald and binnie barnes .  also in the huge cast are edward everett horton ,  reginal owen ,  mona maris ,  douglas dumbrille and anne jeffreys .  also to been seen in extended bit parts are esther dale ,  almira sessions ,  grace hayle ,  gertrude hoffman ,  rafaela ottiano ,  odette myrtile ,  cecil cunningham and many others .   great fun and nice to see the wonderful macdonald in her jitterbug/vamp routines .  she could do it all . 
it appears that there's no middle ground on this movie !  most of it takes place in a dream and ,  like most dreams ,  it's often foolish and illogical .  it's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances ,  especially by our angel .   jeanette's deadpan ,  unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious ,  and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight .  at one point ,  she gets to sing a snippet from carmen ,  followed by the final trio of faust  ( holding a lapdog ,  for some strange reason )  ,  then  " aloha oe "  on the beach !    it's a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove . 
have never understood why the macdonald-eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly--not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone .  to me ,   " i married an angel "  is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo's more celebrated outings .  the sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an mgm musical ,  the script is by the reliable anita loos  (  " san francisco ,  "   " the women ,  "   " gentlemen prefer blondes ,  "  etc .  )  ,  the rodgers and hart tunes  ( albeit altered a bit by macdonald-eddy regulars bob wright and chet forrest )  are given celestial treatment by herbert stothart  ( oscar-winner for scoring  " the wizard of oz "  )  ,  and best of all ,  the  " singing sweethearts "  look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings .  try to show  " rose marie "  or  " sweethearts "  to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still ,  but this offbeat ,  fast-paced fantasy is bound to entertain . 
this was a great movie with a good cast ,  all of them hitting on all cylinders .  and when dianne keaton is at her best ,  well ,  it just doesn't get any better than that .  but tom everett scott ,  always underrated ,  was even better .  he should be a star .    my only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay .  none of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter wasn't always a good person .  and neither was her mother ,  played by keaton .  at one point she breaks a promise she made to one character not to reveal that he had been sleeping around .    one of the other commentators said the movie had a  " political agenda "  .  that is a baffling thing to say .  there was no politics at all in this movie . 
audiard made here a very interesting movie .  it begins with the description of an almost-deaf young woman ,  in its working universe as a secretary ;  she is ignored ,  frustrated ,  rejected .  .  .  hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life  :  but the guy is just coming out from jail .  their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively .  characters'description is profund ,  goes into details .  .  . both start to help each other ;  for she can read on lips ,  which reveals itself to be very useful for him .  .  . she will progressively evolve ,  far from what she was at first .   it's beautifully filmed ;  the whole is very convincing ,  even if it turns into a film noir at the end .  gesture is in particular beautifully observed in audiard's filming .  emmanuelle devos should be nominated at the best actess cesar awards for her magistral play .  action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple  " etude de moeurs "  .  it's actually surprisingly entertaining  :  8/10 . 
i thought this was one of the best movies i've seen in a very long time .  it was a great story line and showed that people are so intricate in all kinds of different ways .  have recommended it to all my friends !  !  i always enjoy a good story line and this movie had one of the best i've seen in a long time .  i could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things that natalie did to find out more about her life and loves .  it showed how we not only have lives with our families  ;  but also have parts of our lives that we don't share with them - as it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of things we don't do that we are so proud of .   i look forward to another such movie ,  and will keep my eye out . 
diane keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets .  diane keaton ,  ( natalie )  ,  " the family stone "  , '05 ,  who had an only daughter and loved her beyond words can describe .  she always called her and told her ,   " surrender dorothy "  ,  which was an expression used in the 'wizard of oz' , 1939 .  a sudden car accident occurs and natalie gets herself deeply involved with her daughter's friends and lovers .  as natalie investigates ,  the more truths she finds out about herself and her real relationship with her daughter .  great film to view and enjoy ,  especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors . 
i remember seeing this in a the salem movie theater  ( where i used to attend  " kiddie matinée " s almost every saturday )  in dayton ,  ohio when i was a young boy and have never forgotten it .  it simply amazed me and my friends .  i do wish there were some way i could see it again !  i have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail .  i only recently discovered that it was a cousteau film and that blew my mind even more .  how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding .  the fish is actually in the cat's mouth at one point ,  if i remember correctly !  if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful ! 
i very much enjoyed watching this film .  i taped it while watching so that i could review it later .  i actually enjoyed the second viewing more since i was able to absorb more of the clever dialog between natalie and adam ,  the 2 main characters .  i thought the way this story evolved was very thought provoking .  i got very intrigued with how natalie was going to interact with her daughter's friends  ,  at first it seemed that she was going to spew a lot of animosity but once she started interacting more pleasantly i had to see how this visit was going to unfold .  i wasn't disappointed  .  gradually the secrets that sara kept from her mother started to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect ,  a flawed human being like most of us who wanted her freedom from a domineering mother who thought she knew her daughter but unfortunately had to learn in a very painful manner that sometimes to really love someone you have to give them their freedom .  the viewers who stuck with this film to the end saw a very touching performance from diane keaton  ( who is always wonderful ,  even in some of her less well received films-think town and country )  .  the closing scene of diane keaton driving home was well worth waiting for ,  revealing that anyone who loves another human being has got to learn that we have to live our own lives ,  we love others but don't own them and ultimately we have to let go .  it's a hard lesson but well worth contemplating now and then . thank you cbs for this broadcast , it was worth the long wait . 
i completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie .  for instance ,  the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could  " hollywood "  just throw in a token gay character in the movie .  and besides there was two gay characters and i thought they reflected each other great .  one was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top .  and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters .  for instance when she and adam went to look at the car that sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible .  but i guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad .  but if you're more open-minded and i don't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you'll enjoy this film . 
charles mcdougall's resume includes directing episodes on 'sex and the city' ,  'desperate housewives' ,  queer as folk' ,  'big love' ,  'the office' ,  etc .  so he comes with all the credentials to make the tv film version of meg wolitzer's novel surrender ,  dorothy a success .  and for the most part he manages to keep this potentially sappy story about sudden death of a loved one and than manner in which the people in her life react afloat .   sara  ( alexa davalos )  a beautiful unmarried young woman is accompanying her best friends - gay playwright adam  ( tom everett scott )  ,  adam's current squeeze shawn  ( chris pine )  ,  and married couple maddy  ( lauren german )  and peter  ( josh hopkins )  with their infant son - to a house in the hamptons for a summer vacation .  the group seems jolly until a trip to the local ice creamery by adam and sara )  results in an auto accident which kills sara .  meanwhile sara's mother natalie swedlow  ( diane keaton )  who has an active social life but intrusively calls here daughter constantly with the mutual greeting 'surrender ,  dorothy' ,  is playing it up elsewhere :  when she receives the phone call that sara is dead she immediately comes to the hamptons where her overbearing personality and grief create friction among sara's friends .  slowly but surely natalie uncovers secrets about each of them ,  thriving on talking about sara as though doing so would bring her to life .  natalie's thirst for truth at any cost results in major changes among the group and it is only through the binding love of the departed sara that they all eventually come together .   diane keaton is at her best in these roles that walk the thread between drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together .  the screenplay has its moments for good lines ,  but it also has a lot of filler that becomes a bit heavy and morose making the actors obviously uncomfortable with the lines they are given .  yes ,  this story has been told many times - the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy is altered by disclosures - but the film moves along with a cast pace and has enough genuine entertainment to make it worth watching .  grady harp
the movie held my interest ,  mainly because dianne keaton is my favorite actress .  i disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted .  i had no trouble following it  ( maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before )  .  the movie was very sad and touching as well .  what more do you want ?  alexa davalos is a fine new talent  ( beautiful too )  ,  and tom everett scott does an excellent job with his part as well .  the relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic ,  but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not .  it was tragically sad but enlightening .  it sure beat the other shows that were on tv new years day evening
i waited for this movie to come out for a while in canada ,  and when it finally did ,  i was very excited to see it .  i really enjoyed it .  of course ,  in the beginning ,  it is a very sad movie  ( and it was new years day - making it even sadder )  - however ,  it sticks with you .  the next day i was thinking about it again ,  because although it revolves around something so emotionally draining ,  you realize after a few days that it is such a beautiful story .  how one person can be seen as the link to so many people ,  but sometimes you can be blinded so many things .  and how diane keaton's character kind of saves the rest of them by just being there .  and how they save her in the process as well .  it was such an excellent movie ,  and chris pine  ( one of my favourite actors )  provides the perfect comic relief .  it is definitely a movie that will need a box of tissues ,  but will really stay with you for a long time . 
what if a platoon of g . i . 's from the japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the tokugawa shogunate ?  great pitch right ?  the movie does exactly what it says on the tin .   thankfully the writers didn't bother to explain the ,  usually ridiculous in sci-fi movies ,  scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport .  no how's or why's .  they just did .  however the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful ,  if not a bit dated .  not as silly as one would imagine .   the rest of the movie follows the premise to a t .  but while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the g . i . s arrival to medieval japan ,  it picks up with a devastating battle sequence .  undoubtedly it's the main order of the day .  the whole concept and by extension the movie itself ,  was probably originated from this simple pitch :  what if g . i . 's equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais ?  and boy does it deliver .   the main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in 70's action/war movies .  not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length ,  it's also a terrific mish-mash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like g . i .  samurai can deliver .  i mean ,  where else would you get the chance to feature tanks ,  ninjas complete with shuriikens ,  a helicopter and samurais in the same shot ?  the g . i .  platoon led by lieutenant iba tears literally through hundreds of extras ,  gunning them down with machine guns ,  mortars ,  grenades and tanks .   this mish-mash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai-geki epic of kurosawa's kagemusha or hiroshi inagaki's samurai banners ,  while the other is in western action and war movies .  there are stylistic touches  ( like the wonderful slow-motion shots and bloody violence )  that bring sam peckinpah or enzo g .  castellari circa keoma to mind .  japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other hollywood works and vice versa ,  and g . i .  samurai effortlessly turns this east-meets-west melting pot into an exciting film .   the film-makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it .  not that tongue-in-cheek mentality is completely absent ,  it's just that it doesn't try to pander to so-bad-it's-good audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies .  the budget was probably hefty ,  as it is evident in the hundreds of extras ,  elaborate costumes  ( very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai-geki )  and special effects .  the camera-work and editing are all top notch ,  almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves .   it's not withouts its flaws either of course .  there are many  " song "  scenes ,  where all sorts of 70's japanese rock ,  disco and country songs play over montages  ( there's a bonding scene ,  a love-interest scene ,  a  " war is hell "  scene etc )  .  the songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing .  although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes ,  it flies like a bullet for the most part .  still some scenes ,  flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect .   the cast also deserves a mention ,  featuring such prominent names as sonny chiba ,  isao natsuyagi  ( goyokin ,  samurai wolf )  ,  tsunehiko watase  ( the yakuza papers )  and hiroyuki sanada ,  all of them hitting the right notes . 
 " gi samurai "  sees sonny chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken feudal japan for no particular reason ,  and much carnage ensues .  it's a rather over the top essay of sword vs .  machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting results .   the plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title ;  initial fish-out-the-water antics  (  " what is this flying metal box ?  "  etc etc )  ,   " aren't we better off here "  discussions and ultimately a huge battle .  the latter is proof that the film doesn't take itself seriously at all ,  the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles chiba's platoon ;  a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to overwhelm with its inventiveness and extravagance .  it's certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and doesn't drag despite its extended length .   chiba gives a gruff performance as iba ,  initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him .  this is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific cv .  by the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers ,  as they seem to be asking  " weren't we better off back then ? ' .  but this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of  ( almost )  non stop action . 
what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters ?  the major point is we believe in those characters and once they've met each other we want them to stay together .  it's simple and really efficient .  the background story is less important .  why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller ?  it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most french film-jerkers like to make .  not too much ambition ,  right :  sur mes lèvres is only an entertaining french film with good characterization .   for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy .  it goes quite as easy as in rear window  ( an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film )  but with a less compelling context .  where i am amazed it's to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased .  he brings very little to the story ;  when he appears alone we wonder if we've not missed a part before .  jacques audiard is not a new-comer yet .  strange and weird . 
pop quiz :  you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history .  what do you do ?  well ,  if you're a hollywood studio ,  you change the japanese g . i . s in g . i .  samurai  ( aka timeslip )  to the crew of an american aircraft carrier ,  have them debate stopping the attack on pearl harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no-one reminds you that japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this sonny chiba movie .  but unlike its hollywood counterpart the final countdown ,  this sees its premise through :  thrown back 400 years into the japanese feudal wars ,  its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs .  samurai action ,  including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other .  and yes ,  there are decapitations .   of course ,  things don't go as planned ,  and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers .  even before that ,  the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home ,  those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the hell of it .  impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through ,  the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction ,  especially when they feature english lyrics sung by japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language ,  but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner .   optimum's uk dvd is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version . 
i would firstly say that somehow i remember seeing this movie in my early childhood ,  i couldn't read the subtitles and i thought sonny chiba was sean connery .  but i did really like the concept .  if you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie .  that said ,  having just watched the restored 137 minute version on dvd i have to say i enjoyed it ,  though not as much as when i was seven  (  i remembered the ending  )  .    there are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism  ,  the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments ,  my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music  (  listen to the lyrics  )  .    for an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll .  by the ending of the movie i had decided that this was a good thing ,  when seven i though the 'relationship' guff was a bad thing .   for an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action ,  especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of shogun era warriors .  the makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and ,  lets face it ,  humorous .  i thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when i was a kid ,  and i am not ashamed to say that i still do .   i also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general don't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum ,  they've got heavy calibre machine guns ,  mortars ,  rocket launchers ,  a tank and a helicopter and they're hell bent on making feudal japan theirs .  which is what i'd like to think any vigorous imdb user would do in their boots .   in short the movies worth watching ,  it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise ,  and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like g . i .  samurai is so unique . 
i just finished watching the 139 min version  ( widescreen )  with some friends and we were blown away .  i won't bother repeating what others have said .  what the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun .  the huge battle is exhausting .  afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didn't keep us from being completely involved and entertained .   there is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific music/songs .  blues ,  country/folk and rock ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter .  it's hideous .  you have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you grounded .   there are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera .  there are many uses of silence as well as slow-motion photography that work beautifully .  i really wish i could erase the music but alas .   seek this out .  it's fun ,  it's different and it takes you to places you wouldn't expect and that's very refreshing . 
excellent episode movie ala pulp fiction .  7 days - 7 suicides .  it doesnt get more depressing than this .  movie rating :  8/10 music rating :  10/10
i just can't agree with the above comment - there's lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one ,  it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for it's effective use of silence .  what's more ,  it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way ,  not pulling any punches in what it shows ,  yet not dwelling and over-sensationalising the subject matter .  it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art-house cinema ,  and deserves a place amongst the canon of 'different' horror films like the blair witch project and the original ring  ( both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on )  .  it's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror cinema . 
der todesking is not one of my favorite jorg buttgereit film - but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and it's reasons and ramifications .  those looking for a gore-fest ,  or exploitation in the style of the nekromantik films or schramm will probably be disappointed .  der todesking is definitely an  " art-house "  style film ,  so those that need linear ,  explainable narratives need not apply .  .  .   the basic concept of der todesking is that there is an  " episode "  for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide ,  interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse .  .  .   there are some very well done and thought provoking scenes ,  including the man talking about the  " problems "  with his wife ,  and the concert massacre  ( which unfortunately lost some of it's  " power "  on me ,  because i was too busy laughing at the scorpions look-alike band on stage .  .  .  )  .  but seriously - this is a sometimes beautiful  ( the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance of the scene ,  and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge .  .  .  )  ,  sometimes confusing ,  sometimes silly  ( the she wolf of the ss rip-off is pretty amusing )  ,  sometimes harrowing  ( i found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective )  film that is more of an  " experience "  then just entertainment ,  as many of these  " art "  films are meant to be .  still ,  i didn't find der todesking to be as strong as nekromantik or schramm ,  and would probably put it on relatively even footing with nekromantik 2 in terms of my personally  " enjoyment level "  .  definitely worth a look to any buttgereit or  " art "  film fan .  if you dig this type of film - check out subconscious cruelty - in my opinion the best art-house/horror film that i've seen .  7/10 for der todesking
what's the best way to start a review of a movie like der todesking ?  let me start by saying i've just come direct from viewing this movie ,  and the images are still burned deep into my brain - and i don't think they'll be moving any time soon .   it's probably fair to say that if you're on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you haven't seen it .  if not ,  let me forewarn you that this is not a moderate-budget gem that's been lost for a few years a la  " near dark "  ,  nor is it a low budget ,  schlocky ,   " fun "  b-movie .  what it is it low-budget art ,  put forward in a simple yet poignant way .  the idea is a simple one - seven stories revolving around ,  and ending in ,  suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse .  sounds simple right ,  even boring ?  it isn't .  words can't really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through ;  it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or not .   i could go on a ramble here about the technical pros and cons of the direction ;  maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super-8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky .  i could point out that some of the sound effects are out-of-sync in a way to rival any fulci movie ,  but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into insignificance .   as far as extreme movies go ,  i've seen the hardest of them ,  and yet der todesking moved me in a way that few others have managed ,  despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that i would consider  " gratuitous "  .  in fact ,  the most disturbing scene i found was the last tale .  i won't ruin it ,  just to say that the character's emotional agony virtually drips from the screen and makes you sympathise ,  if not yearn for his end .    sure ,  it's not the best movie ever made ,  and in a lot of places is seems crude and maybe a little amateurish ,  but in spite of these flaws der todesking is an experience i would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema .  if you're someone who likes comfortable viewing or  " nice "  movies ,  or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless ,  this is not what you're looking for .    whether you enjoy it or not ,  it's one you won't forget in a hurry . 
jörg buttgereit goes a bit too far with his movies and themes at times ,  even for my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to classify .  they are artistically made ,  with also often deeper meaning to its themes .  this movie is a perfect example of his work .   it's also really hard to label this movie .  it's not really a movie with a story to it ,  in a sense of having a beginning ,  middle and end in it .  it also doesn't have a main character but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killings ,  on 7 different days .   all different stories are being told with lots of class ,  though some of them are of course more 'interesting' and realistic than the others .  they are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story .  the movie doesn't feel disjointed at all .  all different stories have a different feel to it and buttgereit tells the story without hardly using any words  ( also typical for his style )  but instead lets the images and obvious sensible emotions of the characters tell the entire story .  it helps to make this movie an effective one to watch .   again ,  the production values all aren't too high and this might be something that might scare off some people .  it however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark ,  disturbing and depressing themes .   a buttgereit movie that i 'enjoyed' watching .   7/10
 " der todesking "  is not exactly the type of film that makes you merry jörg buttgereit's second cult monument in a row ,  which is actually a lot better than the infamous  " nekromantik "  ,  exists of seven short episodes  one for each day of the week  revolving on unrelated people's suicides .  in between these already very disturbing episodes ,  buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse .  the episodes aren't all equally powerful but ,  as a wholesome ,   " der todesking "  is ranked quite high on the list of all-time most depressing art-house films .  particularly the episodes on wednesday ,  involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park ,  and the one of sunday ,  focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead ,  are extremely intense and devastating to observe .  the added value of this film ,  or any other shockumenary like it ,  is debatable and i'm not even sure whether or not buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here .  there's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these people's motivations to end their lives so dramatically .  entirely unlike i expected ,   " der todesking "  isn't exploitative or repulsively graphic !  on the contrary actually ,  i never could have hoped buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery .  the thursday episode is a perfect example of this ,  as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous german bridge while the names ,  ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen .  the production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism ,  but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema .  the subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful  but also indispensable  aspects of life .  great use of tragic music ,  too ! 
my god  !  buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies i've ever seen .  closer to peter greenaway and jean-luc godard's movies ,  this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the nekromantiks .  all the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive ,  in spite of the lack of money  ( see the  " bridge "  sketch )  .  highly highly recommended  ! 
carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids .  when she finds herself overloaded at work ,  she is able to hire paul to help her out .  paul is just out of jail ,  and his past is not entirely behind him .  to say too much more about the story ,  which has many twists ,  would be a mistake .   the most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when carla can hear and when she can't -- a sort of  " point of hear "   ( like point of view )  .  the early scenes that set this up ,  as well as the early character development of carla and paul ,  was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on ,  some of which were hard to follow and/or stretched credibility a bit .  there is also some unpleasant violence .  back to the positive side ,  the cinematography was very good .   the film is worth seeing ,  but perhaps not seeking out .  seen at the san francisco international film festival on 4/28/2002 . 
 " der todesking " -jorg buttgereit's second full-length feature film ( the first one was notorious  " nekromantik "  ) has no central character or characters , but instead thematic continuity in the act of suicide . divided into days of the week , it comprises of a series of set-pieces , each of which featuring the self-destruction of a complete stranger . yes , the production values are low and it's disturbing , but in many ways  " der todesking "  is extremely effective . it makes you think which is sometimes more important than pure entertainment . unlike the other buttgereit's works it isn't very gory , but there are some unpleasant images like castration scene in the tuesday episode , a decomposing corpse and various acts of suicide . the last ( sunday ) episode is so depressing and full of pain ! -just amazing if you want my opinion . 10 out of 10-check out this post-modernism shocker ! disturbing art in the purest form ! 
i read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about liebe des totes  ( the love of the dead )  or something similar .  this of course awoke my curiosity so i ordered nekromantik 1 & 2 and der todesking  ( the death king )  .  the nekromantik movies are ok ,  even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject necrophilia  ( even if they obviously are horror-opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind ,  they are actually quite funny .  )   todesking ,  on the other hand is ,  in my opinion ,  one of the best films ever made .  it consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death .  death as an enemy ;  death as a reliever ,  death as the very fysical decomposition of the body .  the film is a metaphor over life .  it shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are .  it reduces its viewers to the childs they  ( we )  actually are .  the fact that we cannot really understand the nature of death ,  and hence neither the process of dying ,  is the core message of the film .  this is a most realistic film .  never does buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever .  no matter what moral standards you set up ,  death is unevitable ,  and will sooner or later be not a fiction but your reality .  this applies to you ,  dear reader ,  like it applies to the viewers of the film .  some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this ,  which is fully excused ,  since they of course will live forever .  .  .   this is no exploitation movie .  why ?  because death does not exploit us humans .  it harvests us .  we grow for seven days ,  then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre-birth ,  that is death .  buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales .  whether you choose to regard it as  " optimistic "  or  " pessimistic "  is up to you .  at first glance it may seem very dark .  consider though ,  that in order for something to live ,  something else must die .   " who wants to live forever ?  "   i believe that when buttgereit shows a body ,  that are being consumed by maggots ,  he shows not only decomposition ,  but generation of new life .  is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil ,  than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre ?   when you realize this ,  you see der todesking it its right context .   sieben tage hat die woche ,  siebenmal letzte stunden .  seven are the days of week  ( weak ,  mortal  !  )  ,  seven times the last hour .   dont fear the reaper ,  buttgereit tells us ,  because the reaper takes only what is ripe .  and apples that are not plucked for food will rot !   have a good life ,  fellow imdb'ers  !    ( and watch this film ,  that compares only to ingemar bergmans  " the seventh seal "  in terms of depth and universality ) 
the author of  " nekromantik "  ,  jörg buttgereit's second feature film ,   " der todesking "  is a powerful masterpiece .  centered around a chain letter originating from a group called  " the brotherhood of the 7th day "  ,  the movie shows 7 episodes ,  each consisting of one day during one week ,  where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making it's rounds .  do not touch this one if you like hollywood movies or musicals ,  enjoy happy or even remotely  " normal "  movies or expect a movie to be good only ,  if it is focused on stage acting .   the nihilistic ,  avant-garde approach of der todesking well explains ,  why buttgereit's movies in general were banned in germany ,  their native country of origin ,  during the 80's and most of the 90's .  der todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing on-screen ,  but the meaningless apathy or depression most people's lives consist of in general .  buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living ,  only reasons to stop ,  and in choosing how and when you die ,  you can also be the king of death ,  der todesking .   buttgereit's movies are generally difficult to categorize and der todesking is no exception .  featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies ,   " art film "  would probably be the closest description every time .  der todesking features an original method to shoot ,  create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene .  during one scene ,  the camera slowly ,  continuously pans in 360 degree circle ,  while a person lives in a small one-room apartment for a day .  during another ,  buttgereit uses sound and film corruption to depict the collapsing mental state of a man ,  while he dwells in his desperation .  during a third ,  seemingly pleasant scene names ,  ages and occupations of actual people to have committed suicide are shown on-screen ,  supposedly warranting the ban in germany for this particular movie .   episode movies  ( and especially this one ,  as the scenes are only vaguely connected )  generally suffer from incoherence ,  and der todesking is no exception .  while all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and it's consequences or subsequences in all it's variations ,  there are very powerful episodes ,  yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material ,  partly draining the overall power of the movie - still ,  the the jaw-dropping ,  immensely powerful intermissions depicting a decomposing body manage to keep the movie together and cleanse it from it's more vague moments back to the status of greatness .  the general atmosphere is baffling ,  awe-inspiring ,  highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting - so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival i took part of .   this is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and i strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come .  not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans ,  this is a small ,  different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience .  whether it be confusion ,  amazement or even hate ,  you aren't likely to be left cold by this ,  in my opinion the best ,  achievement of this small indie crew .   the main theme of the movie ,   " die fahrt ins reich der menschentrümmer part i-iii "  was released in a limited 666-piece 8 "  vinyl edition ,  which is now much sought after .  you still can get the classical masterpiece by getting  " the nekromantik "  soundtrack cd ,  which i highly recommend .  the lo-fi synthesizer music in the movie is dark and quirky ,  almost illbient-like ,  makes an essential part of the movie's atmosphere ,  and is something you would very ,  very rarely hear otherwise .  much recommended ! 
i was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute .  it is brilliantly shot ,  with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed .  the plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike .  she hires an assistant at work ,  with her true intention being to find love .  he's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her .  in return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off .  the film transcends into a dark film noir ,  with a couple of truly excellent scenes ,  and an even better finale .  the real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's disability .  the use of sound keeps the tension consistent ,  and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping ,  that's for sure .  throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you've got the makings of a great film .  it's the sort of film hollywood really wants to make ,  but just can't . 
 " like the first touch of pleasure and guilt ,  like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear ,  like a climax of contrary emotions "  said one of the movie buffs after viewing love at the top ,  the misinterpreted title version of stylish director michel deville's le mouton enrage .    vincent canby in new york times ,  however ,  just after the 1974 premiere of the movie stated :   " love at the top which opened yesterday at the 68th street playhouse ,  is a 1973 french comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteen-fifties english comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessingand possessed byambition .  "  yet ,  the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that love at the top is not concerned with the english class system .  .  .  ( january 27 ,  1975 )   having left the evaluations up to single individuals ,  of course ,  the test of time has done its just job .  what may be said with certainty after more than 30 years is that we can hardly find such movies like le mouton enrage where decadence appears innocent ,  where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic ,  where feelings occur so manipulative .    for romy schneider's fans ,  it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see ,  not only because she gives a unique performance  ( as she did in all of her roles )  at the heyday of her career  ( 9 years before her sudden death )  but because she is particularly attractive here .  it is not trio infernal where the ,  so to say ,  'forced escape' from and the mockery of romy's sweet image haunted for years by saccharine sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation ,  but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role .  she plays roberte ,  a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story's lead ,  playboy nicolas mallet  ( jean louis trintignant )  .  it is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons .  this movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of romy and she is given some of her very best scenes .  romy's sex appeal is unforgettable here .   another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception .  immoral as it may seem ,  the director makes a perfect use of contrast :  conventions vs pleasures ,  innocence vs decadence ,  genuine lust vs instrumental affair .  nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest ,  may find attractive or disgusting ;  yet ,  his are the features the viewers must treat seriously ,  more to say ,  they are the ones we all must accept .  that is why ,  one is led to a peculiar ,  gently wild ,  erotically unique world of the main character .  although he sleeps with lots of women ,  there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for nicola :  roberte groult  ( romy schneider )  and marie-paul  ( jane birkin )  .  he manipulates them ,  makes love to them ,  cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money ;  yet ,  he perceives them differently .  yet ,  despite all of this 'adult maturity , ' he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toy-car on the table - a sort of 'detailed insight into male mind .  .  . ' in a comedy-like way ,  of course .   finally ,  there are very good performances ,  which makes le mouton enrage slightly underrated .  not only the aforementioned romy schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role ,  but young jane birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young ,  inexperienced streetwalker marie paul ,  jean louis trintignant makes it possible to see nicola in the right way .  this artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by camille saint-saëns ,  the tune that will ring in your ears for long .  therefore ,  apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors ,  slow action  ( sometimes )  ,  possible clichés  ( noticed by some viewers )  ,  the merits should be found significant .    le mouton enrage ,  in sum ,  is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life .  it is worth seeing as a moment in romy's career ,  a prelude to strong eroticism ,  a chain of contrary emotions ,  of love and hatred ,  appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm .  .  .  but aren't we ,  humans ,  'viewers , ' movie buffs built upon such contrasts ? 
this is a comedy of morals ,  so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs ,  but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything .   this film ,  marvelously written and directed ,  is a gem that shines perfectly ,  with beautiful acting by all .  jean-louis trintignant is exquisite as usual ,  and romy schneider is a pearl ,  perfect and glowing ,  that is not to be missed .  a truly wonderful film  !  ! 
nicolas mallet is a failure .  a teller in a bank ,  everyone walks all over him .  then his friend ,  a writer who's books no one likes ,  has a plan to change his life .  our hero tells his boss he is quitting .  he intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women .  and he manages to do just that .   if it were not for the amount of death  ( murder/suicide/natural causes )  in the film ,  this would be a farce .  there are numerous jabs at marriage ,  politics ,  journalism and .  .  . life .   jean-louis trintignant is a likable amoral rogue .  romy schneider is at her most appealing .  definitely worth a look . 
love at the top--the utterly wrongheaded american title for the superb french film  " le mouton enrage "   ( which means ,  i think ,  the rabid sheep ) -- is such an original movie ,  the fact that it dates back to 1974 seems all the more astounding .  this film was far ahead of its time ;  even by today's highest standards ,  it accomplishes things that seem rich and new .  filmed by the hugely underrated director michel deville ,  it rather defies description in the way it combines social critique ,  comedy ,  mystery ,  love ,  sex and satire into one wholly original mix--leaving for the end a major but subtle surprise to render all that has gone before suddenly sad and more understandable .  the cast is splendid ,  ditto the writing and theme .  but it's deville's delicious tone ,  keeping you constantly off-balance but enrapt ,  that pushes this  " lost "  film to a very high level indeed .   ( the written interview with the director on the  " special features "  section of the dvd is definitely worth reading if you have the time .  ) 
 " kalifornia "  is a good hollywoodish odyssey of suspense and terror which tells of two couples who drive cross-country to california to share the cost of gas :  a pair of losers  ( lewis & pitt )  and two wannabee artists ,  a photographer and a writer  ( duchovny & forbes )  .  pitt  " nails "  his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller .  a good watch for those into psycho-killer flix . 
so-so thriller starring brad pitt and juliette lewis ,  who join david duchovny and michelle forbes on a road trip out west .  the latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book ;  pitt's a serial killer on the lam  ( unbeknownst to dave )  and juliette is his poor ,  not-all-there companion .  this is a good cast and the story moves along ,  but pitt isn't belivably scary as a serial killer ,  although it is one of his better earlier roles .  the best thing is here is michelle forbes ,  who always manages to shine ,  whether in her roles on `homicide :  life on the street' or in the brief series `wonderland . '  vote :  6
 " kalifornia " is a great film that makes us look at ourselves . the film has a great cast , brad pitt ( johnny suede , a river runs through it , and the legends of the fall ) as early grayce , david duchovny ( the x files ) as brian kessler , michelle forbes ( star trek : the next generation , homicide : life on the street , and escape from l . a .  ) as carrie loughlin , brian's girlfriend , and juliette lewis ( natural born killers , cape fear , and what's eating gilbert grape ) as adele corners , early's girlfriend .   brian kessler is a writer who is a liberal , is getting ready to write a book about serial killers . brian and his girlfriend , carrie decide they want to move to california , so brian places an ad at the college for some who wants to go to california , to share expenses on the trip .   early grayce is an ex con and sociopath on parole , who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town , is in debt , owes his landlord money . early's parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job . early goes to the college and sees the ad , he later tells adele , his girlfriend about leaving to go to california . early and adele meet brian and carrie at the bus stop and leave town . brian and carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed his landlord . for a little while brian and carrie thought of early and adele different but got to know them and become sort of friends , carrie and adele become real good friends .   their journey is a very learning one . though brain and carrie not knowing early is a killer till later on in the movie . the question brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question . early grayce is a sociopath who doesn't see the error of his ways , goes down hill later on and pays the price .   this film is a great movie , i give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up . i love the songs in the movie , especially at the end of the film , the song " look up to the sky " by the indians . 
david duchovny and michelle forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to california ,  but can't really afford to ,  so they 'ride share "  with another young couple  ( brad pitt and juliette lewis )  to save on expenses .  the idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way ,  sites where serial killers did their thing ,  since brian  ( duchovny )  is a writer and carrie  ( forbes )  is his photographer .  what they don't know is that pitt  ( earley )  and lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever he says .  i don't care for pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles .  the scary thing is that he does them so well ;  i've actually known people like him before ,  no ,  not killers ,  but with pretty much the same mindset .  anyway ,  as the road trip goes along ,  carrie guesses that the others are about out of money ,  but earley seems to always come up with the cash somehow .  .  .  . never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though .  lewis does her role well ,  one that she excels at ,  a not-too-bright waif that has a good heart but doesn't understand that she doesn't have to put up with being beaten up by earley when she does something he doesn't like .  as things begin to get more unacceptable carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station ,  and unfortunately it's at that point where she's inside that she sees a news bulletin that tells her exactly who they've been ride-sharing with ,  after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip .  this is not the greatest flick in the world ,  but it's not bad .  .  . i watched what was supposed to be the 'unrated' version but i wonder how much was cut out of the rated version ,  because this seemed fairly tame to me ,  really .  .  . not that this makes it family fare or anything ,  unless it's maybe the manson family .  7 out of 10 . 
i have to start off by apologizing because i thought the first 75-80% of this film was hilarious .  it's mostly because of brad pitt's performance .  spot on .   the acting by all involved was quite good but brad stole the movie .  the atmosphere was perfect in all respects .  i'm not a giant pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever .   brutal , honest , gritty .  all good words to describe this movie .   i was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind early's violence isn't explained .  it is explained but they thankfully don't have to go into graphic detail to get their point across .   overall i gave this a 9 because every scene bar 1 or 2 was effective .  i think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie .  underrated . 
this movie is great !  brad pitt will never be able to out act the performance he gave in this movie .  duchovny was top notch ,  as was forbes and lewis .  the 4 main characters embark on a scenic road tour of historic murder sites ,  in one of the coolest cars ever made ,  1960's model lincoln continental .  early grace is a simpleton with a taste for dry toothbrushes and carnage .  he likes his women to not curse or smoke ,  and wear pwt dresses .  duchovny and forbes are a pair of artists from the city ,  while early and lewis are trailer parkers from the rural outskirts .  even though the majority tone in the film is dark ,  there are plenty of funny scenes to be had .  the writing ,  directing ,  and acting are brilliant .  if you like road movies ,  murder ,  humor ,  and narration ,  watch this film .  everyone delivers ,  and you will want more when the credits roll .  one of my all time favorites .   " hey .  .  . shave that dog n teach it to hunt !  " 
i can't say too much about kalifornia as sadly i have yet to actually see the whole thing  ( i've only managed to see it in bits and pieces on fuse .  )  but what i have seen is absolutely awesome !  i am a fan of brad pitt but i admit not all his earlier movies are well good .  but this role ,  i just ,  his acting is great ,  his character early seems so normal well okay creepy ,  dark weird but you know normal for a hillbilly of that type i guess .  and juliette lewis's performance although i can see how some may be annoyed by it i think it's amazing .  sadly i have yet to see the end ,  but from reading other reviews on here it sounds good ,  but disappointing .  i have to admit that i wish david duchovany's  ( sorry if the spelling on that is incorrect )  was a bit flat but for him it was okay .  his wife's character was better ,  and i thought her performance while not the best in the movie was pretty good ,  a portrait of the avant-gard/older sister type .  particularly the scene where early and brian go to play pool ,  and adele and carrie are having their one on one time together .  i've watched that scene at least twice now and i still think the acting in it is just wonderful .  one because of the emotion that adele portrays after talking about being raped by the three guys and how she feels about early and carrie's reaction to it .  everything about that i think is just so perfect .  i mean ,  maybe it's because i can relate a bit ,  i'm not sure .    as for brad pitt who plays the serial killer that we actually get to see for once ;  i thought he was great .  some movies with pitt that i've seen were just average or not worth seeing .  i don't think i've ever seen a terrible pitt movie or if i have it's not because of his acting it's other factors .  this movie was not one of them .  he turned out a great performance in kalifornia .  i swear i'm not just some random i do like him for his acting not just because he's good looking ,  i mean his character in this movie isn't exactly handsome or cute by any means !  pitt is dark ,  brooding and downright scary at times .  yet he's also cheerful ,  funny ,  nice ,  and even loving towards adele .  granted there are some spots that made me want to reach through the tv and strangle him but that's probably just me  ( and the character pitt played in the movie .  )  but it also shows how good pitt's acting was in this movie it made me forget that he was playing a character ,  that is what good acting is supposed to do .    at any rate i wish i could say more ,  but that's all i can really say without having seen the ending ,  i have seen most of the movie through what i've caught on fuse and as i'm writing this i'm taping it on dvr so hopefully i can write a more complete review later .  i just wanted to share my thoughts on a movie that i thought was something really cool and something that seems to have gotten overlooked  ( it shouldn't have !  ) 
a surprisingly effective thriller ,  this .   david duchovny and michelle 'ensign ro' forbes are a successful ,  professional couple ,  he a writer ,  she a photographer .  forbes is desperate to move to california and ,  in an act of compromise ,  mulder agrees to the move on the condition that ,  along the way ,  they visit sites of historical interest concerning famous serial killers .  his idea :  he writes the words ,  she takes the pictures ,  with the end result a bestselling coffee table book that will set them up for life .  to help finance the trip ,  they decide to car share and advertise the fact .  as their bad luck would have it brad pitt sees the advert and ,  shortly after killing his landlord ,  he and his girlfriend ,  juliette lewis ,  meet the writer couple and begin their cross country trek .  inevitably ,  mischief ensues .   pitt is outstanding as the genuinely chill inspiring early grayce and is capably backed up by lewis playing her customary white trash character that seems to be her default setting .  duchovny and forbes make for a convincing double act too and ,  as events spiral out of control ,  you as the viewer are sucked into their plight and can feel the tension ratcheting .   intelligent ,  sinister and beautifully shot ,  this deserves recognition beyond its current status .  a top movie . 
this was one scary movie .   brad pitt deserved an oscar for this .   a traveling novelist  ( played by david duchovny of the x-files fame )  and his girlfriend pick up two hitch-hikers ( juliette lewis and brad pitt )  on their way to california .    on their way they stop at infamous serial killer murder scenes to photography the scenes for an upcoming book duchovny's character is working on ,  little do they know that the most disturbed serial killer in the history of the country is sitting right next to them in the same car . 
**** = a masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten  ***1/2 = a classic in time ;  simply a must see  *** = a solid ,  worth-while ,  very entertaining piece  **1/2 = a good movie ,  but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws  ** = may still be considered good in areas ,  but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable  ( e . g .  ,  genre )   *1/2 = mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile moments  bomb = not of a viewable quality  - kalifornia = ***  - unrated  ( for strong violent material ,  considerable sexuality ,  and language )   i rented this film expecting an in-your-face summer-blockbuster-quality celebration of brad pitt's face ,  but was happily surprised and disappointed .  this really is more of a drama ,  and very grim at that .  .  .  i remember some emotionally intense duchovny voice-overs .   pitt plays out his possibly un-sexiest film ever with startling talent .  who started out as a hopeless yet harmless  " white trash "  husband became realized as a violent ,  disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind .  during some of the latter stages in the film ,  i found it hard to keep watching him - he was unpredictable and scary .  this proves very good writing and acting .   the whole movie is filled with bizarre ,  sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once ,  and i don't mean action scenes .  i mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted i actually winced and gasped at what i was seeing .  it was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death .  again ,  i am very impressed with the screenwriter ( s )  ;  whoever they are did the impossible :  mixed oil and water .   i also very much enjoyed juliette lewis's performance .  it is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy .  some of her moments in this film brought me to tears .  i mean that .  the emotions this girl can arouse in your head are incredible ,  and i clearly remember getting blurry-eyed on a few occasions .   i almost feel like i'm cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving  " kalifornia "  a *** rating .  but the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it .  i do believe that everyone should see this movie though .  i truly do . 
i had seen this film many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me .  alas ,  i have hardened to many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by 'kalifornia' upon watching again recently .  i am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago .   there are two things which really give this movie its power .  the first is its cast .  we have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young brad pitt as early grace .  knowing pitt ,  as we all do ,  as one of the most enduring heart-throbs hollywood has ever had ,  it is refreshing to see him play such a vile ,  unattractive character .  pitt pulls the show off without resorting to white-trash cliché or parody ,  and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the movie .   juliette lewis is equally impressive as grace's tragic girlfriend ,  playing the character like a ten year old girl with a forty year old's life experience .  lewis manages to evoke pity  ( for her character's station in life )  as well as contempt  ( for her naivety )  ,  but she underpins her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young .  personally ,  i think it's a tragedy that neither pitt nor lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here .   david duchovony and michelle forbes are both perfectly cast as the yuppy couple who unwittingly end up travelling across the us with pitt and lewis .  duchovony is aptly geeky and naive ,  and forbes seems emphatically cynical and shut-off ,  but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters' changes as they are equally intrigued ,  repulsed and strangely attracted to pitt .   the fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside ,  this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing .  at the time 'kalifornia' was released ,  hollywood was releasing a slew of nice-character-turns-out-to-be-psychotic movies  ( 'single white female' ,  'pacific heights' ,  'the hand that rocks the cradle' ,  'deceived' ,  'sleeping with the enemy' etc )  .  most of these movies followed the same formula ,  the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy .  'kalifornia' doesn't really stray too far from this territory ,  but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow-boil thriller ,  and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn .   when the penny does drop ,  and pitt is let loose to play the maniacal bad guy ,  the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes don't quite live up to rest of the movie .  that said ,  the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold .  the fight is over ,  but the scars will always be there .   much of the narration  ( provided by a somewhat whiny ,  pre x-files duchovony )  is a tad contrived .  of course ,  it's meant to be from the book the duchovony's journalist character has written ,  so one could argue that the self-conscious narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists write .   the film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90% of the thrillers of the past twenty years .  highly recommended ,  but not for the weak of stomach or mind .  this film is disturbing on more than one level .  but then ,  it's meant to be . 
in 1990 brad pitt and juiliette lewis did a tv too young to die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in kalifornia .  i have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film .   kalifornia finds aspiring writer david duchovny and his girl friend ,  art photographer michelle forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to duchovny's obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers .  in fact he's got a most unusual odyssey planned ,  he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers .  but he and forbes are flat broke .   fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of brad pitt and juliette lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip .  it turns out pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own ,  delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amorality .   kalifornia is not the type of film i usually go for ,  but in fact the acting ability and charisma of brad pitt make it work to a large degree .  pitt is the walking definition of an inbred gothic refugee from deliverance .  but better than he is is juliette lewis who once again is playing these low self esteem types which she seems to do well .  watch her scene with forbes as she does her hair and lewis describes her sad and pathetic life .  lewis's dialog and forbes's reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country .   for those who like their slasher flicks ,  they don't come better than kalifornia . 
if this is supposed to be a portrayal of the american serial killer ,  it comes across as decidedly average .   a journalist [duchovny] travels across country to california to document america's most famous murderers ,  unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions [pitt] is a serial killer himself .   rather predictable throughout ,  this has its moments of action and pitt and lewis portray their roles well ,  but i'd not bother to see it again . 
kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals .  a journey on the darkest road ever .  the road of no return .  the plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in california .  the man  ( david duchovny in his best role up to now )  wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in america and his girl - who is a photographer - is going to take the pictures .  so they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them on the way .  to share the journey expenses they decide to find another couple and they put an ad .  but the couple that answers it is not just any couple .  it is one of the strangest couples ever .  the girl is a naive ,  frail creature that dreams a lot and loves cactuses .  the man is exactly the opposite .  a cruel ruthless murderer .  we learn that early in the film and we follow him along the journey to kalifornia  ( not with c as usual ,  but with k ,  presumably symbolizing the word killer )  ,  along his journey of betrayal ,  murder and finally defeat .  all the leads ,  duchovny ,  pitt ,  lewis and forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star .  the photography is amazing ,  with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie ,  and the music suits the dark character of the film .  on the whole this is a really good movie .  don't miss it .  you'll think again before taking some stranger in your car to share the gas with ! 
i bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night .  i do like juliette lewis although i'm indifferent to brad pitt .  after this viewing i have to admit he's a perfectly fine actor - his character was entirely believable ,  and i didn't think  " brad pitt "  at all .   unfortunately i can't say the same for david duchovny .  i'm an x-files fan and i had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie ,  as i'd thought it was made a few years later .  i like duchovny but found his character a little two-dimensional here ,  except where he's doing voice-overs .  that part was strong ,  seemed in character ,  good intonation ,  etc .  otherwise i kept thinking  " agent mulder "  ,  which is a pity .   michelle forbes was a treat .  why haven't i noticed her before ?   ( i'll be looking up to see what other roles she's done and seeing those asap )  i am slightly concerned about stereotyping re lewis ,  this film ,  and  " natural born killers "   ( a firm favourite )  .  interesting though to see a contrast of characters - in nbk she's a willing accomplice ,  whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge early's dark side until it's thrust in her face .   i enjoyed this film almost unreservedly .  apart from duchovny's character not seeming fully-formed  ( and perhaps being  " washed out "  somewhat by pitt's )  ,  it was perfect .  i was also pleased with the ending - glad that the innocent heroes did not die ,  yet they had to suffer first .  it was realistic ,  tense ,  disturbing .   if you like nbk you may well like this movie ,  and vice-versa . 
surely one the french films of the decade so far ,  a taut ,  atmospheric thriller making full use of the lead characters hearing impediment to use sound in a way rarely explored in cinema .  emannuelle devos gives a truly stunning  ,  multi-faceted performance ,  at times devious and manipulative ,  at other times open and vulnerable .  another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from france . 
kalifornia is the story of a writer and his girlfriend photographer who are looking for someone to help pay gas money and take turns at the wheel for a cross country road trip to famous murder sights .  ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend answer the post .  kalifornia is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer .  great performances all around by the leads with pitt in particular being exceptional .  check it out !  ! 
kalifornia came out in 1993 ,  just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006 .  this is a nice psycho-thriller that should appeal to all david duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work ,  like with most of his episodes of the x-files ,  playing god ,  and red shoe diaries .   people who were put off by the heavy southern accent from brad pitt and juliette lewis' characters obviously have never spent much time in the south .  for every  " brian and carrie "  in the south ,  there is an  " adele and early "  and in 2006 ,  that's the real horror of this flick .   aside from that ,  i think the film was written with a cult film intention - like with carrie's photography ,  it's not suitable for mass consumption .  but if you have a copy of this in your personal library ,  i think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies . 
i had seen 'kalifornia' before  ( must be about 10 years ago )  and i still remember to be very impressed by it .  that's why i wanted to see it again and all i can say is that it still hasn't lost its power ,  even though i'm used to a lot more when it comes to movies than that i was ten years ago .   'kalifornia' tells the tale of the writer brian kessler and his girlfriend carrie laughlin ,  a photographer ,  who want to move to california .  but instead of stepping on a plain and flying right to the state where they say it never rains ,  they choose to make a trip by car .  he wants to write a book about america's most famous serial killers and she will make the matching pictures .  but because their car uses an enormous amount of petrol ,  they decide to take another couple with them ,  so they can spread the costs of the trip .  only one couple has answered the add ,  so they will automatically be the lucky ones .  but they haven't met each other yet and when seeing the other couple for the first time ,  when their trip has already started ,  carrie is shocked .  without wanting to be prejudiced ,  she can only conclude that early grayce and adele corners are poor white trailer park trash .  she definitely doesn't want them in her car ,  but brian doesn't really mind to take them with them and decides to stop and pick them up anyway .  at first the couple doesn't seem to be that bad after all ,  but gradually early grayce changes from a trashy hillbilly into a remorseless murderer .  .  .   not only is the story very impressive ,  so is the acting from our four leads .  brad pitt is incredible as early grayce .  his performance in this movie may well be his best ever .  the same for juliette lewis .  she plays the childish and naive girlfriend that doesn't want to hear a bad word about her early and does that really very well .  but david duchovny and michelle forbes are a surprise as well .  they both did a very good job and i really wonder why we never heard anything from forbes again since this movie ,  because she really proves to have a lot of talent .   overall this is a very good and impressive psychological thriller with a very powerful story ,  but because of the graphic violence ,  i can imagine that it may not be to everybody's taste  ( although i don't really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way )  .  personally i really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me  ( it's a part of the story that's too important to be left out )  .  i reward this movie with an 8/10 . 
i just got done watching  " kalifornia "  on showtime for the fourth time since i first saw it back in july of 2001 .  you would think that with the recent wave of serial killer films ,  that  " kalifornia "  would be amongst some of the earlier films worthy of mention but hasn't .  perhaps if this film had been released sometime between like 1996-1999 ,  maybe it might have been more successful .  in my opinion ,   " kalifornia "  is much different from most serial killer films released during the late 1990s .  it has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today's serial killer films like  " seven "  or  " the bone collector "  .  many serial killer films have shown a killer but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough of them to actually learn anything about them .   " kalifornia "  is a film that actually tries to break through that barrier and actually understand the criminal mind .  it tries to answer questions like  " why do they do the things they do ?  is it because of something that happened in their past ?  does it make them feel superior or powerful ?  or do they do it because they like the thrill of the kill ?  "  these are some of the things that  " kalifornia "  tries to answer but also leaves room for us to try and figure things out for ourselves .  brad pitt makes an everlasting impression as early grayce .  when we first meet early in the beginning of the film ,  we see that he is obviously one disturbed individual .  when we first see him ,  it's late at night .  early is possibly drunk .  we then see him pick up a rock ,  throw it off a bridge ,  and it later lands on the windshield of a passing car .  pitt is fierce in this film .  it is always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people .  it's funny that this would later lead him play a true loon like in  " 12 monkeys "  and that he would be on the other end of the spectrum in david fincher's  " seven "  . 
it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem .  everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction :  what a great movie !  !   i've never much cared for brad pitt  ( though his turns in 12 monkeys and fight club show improvement )  but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving ,  dark and right on target .   everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings .  the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening .   the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book ,  is that compared to what came before it ,  the ending is a bit too long and overblown .  but that's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic .   if you check this film out ,  try to get the letterboxed unrated director's cut for the best viewing option .   rating : 9
 " kalifornia "  is one of my all-time favourite movies ,  and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90`s .  the film has a very stylish surface to it ,  but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others .  one of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances ,  brad pitt is startlingly great as a trailer-trash psycho named early .  pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly .  juliette lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend ,  her innocence is almost heart-breaking .   " kalifornia "  has a very simple plot to it ,  that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour ,  but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder ,  as pitt unleashes his psychotic personality .  there are alot of shocking scenes ,  and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days .   " kalifonia "  is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be ,  and not only for it`s violence and gore . 
in the same vein as natural born killers ,  another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that i also loved ,  kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence ,  but i like to think that it turns that around in the final act .  kind of like how the basketball diaries glamorizes drugs at first ,  but shows the bad side by the end of the movie ,  which is far worse than the good side is good .  david duchovny plays brian kessler ,  an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend ,  who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for ,  i don't know where ,  places where nudity passes for art .  maybe it really does and i just don't understand it .  at any rate ,  brian and carrie  ( duchovny and michelle forbes ,  who fits the role flawlessly )  ,  make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites .  brian ,  the writer ,  will write the book ,  carrie can take the pictures .   being artistic types ,  brian and carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip ,  so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses ,  and are contacted by early grace and adele corners  ( brad pitt and juliette lewis )  .  early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer ,  sees the ad on a bulletin board ,  and decides to leave the state for a while ,  violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord's murder so he won't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation .  two birds with one stone ,  you know .   the movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes ,  the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash ,  without resorting to clichés or even ending up with caricatures of either type .  brian and carrie are artsy liberals ,  but while carrie catches on to early and adele ,  brian is fascinated with early's status as an outlaw ,  as seen in the scene where brian shoots early's gun .  never having fired a gun before ,  he's as fascinated as a little kid .  while adele and carrie are back at a hotel and adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that early  " broke her "  of smoking and that she's not allowed to drink  ( early doesn't think women should )  ,  early and brian are out at the local bar .  brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him ,  and early first gives advice to brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy .   " hit him ,  bri ,  it's comin' .  "  this is one of my favorite scenes in the movie ,  partly because it's so funny what early gleefully says as the guy's friends drag him away ,  bloodied and battered ,  but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel ,  we learn so much all at once about the two couples ,  their differences ,  and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them .  and besides that ,  because brian benefited from early's actions and carrie is appalled by what she hears from adele ,  it also illustrates the different way that carrie and brian react to early and adele .   clearly ,  by now ,  you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller ,  where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues .  on one hand it seems a little too convenient that brian and carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer ,  but on the other hand it's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross-country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes .  while studying the actions of past murderers ,  brian and carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying ,  and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past .   i am constantly amazed at brad pitt's versatility as an actor .  consider ,  for example ,  his roles in movies like kalifornia ,  12 monkeys ,  fight club ,  and ocean's 11 and 12 .  pitt is like tom hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character ,  and is completely believable .  incidentally ,  i tried in vain to be early grace for halloween this year ,  but just couldn't get the hair and beard right .  i even got the hat right ,  which initially i thought would be the hardest part .   it's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder ,  but i think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience's understanding of its subject matter .  a film that didn't glorify violence ,  at least initially ,  could never be as effective as kalifornia ,  but the movie structures it perfectly .  the glorification is all embodied in brian's and carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened ,  but their realization ,  and ours ,  is embodied in the real thing ,  which they encounter with early and adele .  the movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real . 
it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem .  everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction :  what a great movie !  !   i've never much cared for brad pitt  ( though his turns in 12 monkeys and fight club show improvement )  but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving ,  dark and right on target .   everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings .  the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening .   the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book ,  is that compared to what came before it ,  the ending is a bit too long and overblown .  but that's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic .   if you check this film out ,  try to get the letterboxed unrated director's cut for the best viewing option .   rating : 9
it's a road movie ,  with a killer on-board .  brian kessler  ( david duchovny )  ,  a sophisticated ,  urbane writer ,  wants to conduct field research on american serial killers .  but ,  neither he ,  nor his girlfriend ,  carrie  ( michelle forbes )  ,  has the money for a cross-country tour of murder sites ,  so they advertise for someone to share travel expenses .  who they end up with is a young couple ,  early grayce  ( brad pitt )  and his girlfriend ,  adele  ( juliette lewis )  ,  two better examples of  " poor white trash "  you will never find in all of cinema .   indeed ,  early and adele are what make this film so entertaining ,  as they babble ,  cackle ,  confide ,  muse ,  speculate ,  drool ,  and otherwise behave in ways i haven't seen since reruns of  " the beverly hillbillies "  .  early's idea of california :   " people think faster out there ,  on account of all that warm weather ;  cold weather makes people stupid "  .  that's enough to convince adele :   " i guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here "  .  to which early responds proudly :   " it sure does "  .  early continues to instruct adele about california :   " you never have to buy no fruit ,  on account it's all on the trees  .  .  .  and they ain't got no speed limits ,  and i hear your first month's rent is free ,  state law "  .   but poor early has some ,  well ,  mental problems ,  which become ever more obvious to brian and carrie as the four travelers proceed west across the u . s .  as they enter the desert southwest ,  with its beautifully stark landscape ,   " kalifornia "  starts to look more and more like  " the hitcher "   ( 1986 )  ,  and early starts to act more and more like john ryder ,  everyone's maniacal hitchhiker ,  whose terror seemed so unstoppable .   in  " kalifornia "  ,  the acting is uneven .  duchovny's performance is flat .  brad pitt is surprisingly effective ,  despite his overacting at times .  michelle forbes is great as the avant-garde ,  photographic artist .  but my choice for best performance goes to juliette lewis .  with her nasal voice and heavy-duty southern accent ,  she is stunning ,  as the naive ,  highly animated ,  child-like adele .   toward the end ,  the film takes on a twilight zone feel to it ,  as our travelers enter a nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated old house full of test mannequins .  the plot dissolves rather messily into unnecessary and preposterous violence ,  an ending that was somewhat disappointing .   overall ,  however ,   " kalifornia "  is an entertaining film ,  thanks to a clever concept ,  great scenery ,  especially in the second half ,  good cinematography ,  great dialogue ,  and that wonderful performance by juliette lewis . 
in a way ,  this film reminded me of  " jumping jack flash "  .  remember whoopi goldberg at the shredding machine ?  whoopi zonked out tranquilizers ?  whoopi as blind lemon and imitating mick jagger ?  great moments captured on film for sure but the movie still kind of sucks ,  right ?  that's how i feel about  " rich in love "  .  a man hears his wife sing for the first time .  post-coital teenagers talk about the nature of love .  albert finney eats ice cream out of bucket and ,  in another scene ,  has a lovely waking moment regarding his absent wife .  alfre woodard adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe .  but there's only the whisper of a plot here and you can't wait for it to get moving .  only when ex-go-gos' charlotte caffey's the graces revs up a great pop song does the picture wake up .  .  . and then it's over !   this picture is the equivalent of a lazy summer's day in the deep american south . 
vincent cassel plays the part of paul ,  an ex-con assigned to an office job where he meets carla ,  a secretary who is quite deaf' ,  when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not  ( played by emmanuelle devos )  .  together they help each other to develop as people .   what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters  not fitting into obvious stereotypes .  paul appears uneasy in the office environment ,  is it that he's just not cut out for work ?  this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines .   the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally ,  even if we think it is harmless or justified .   finally ,  it is a film full of great moments' both touching and humorous .  one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby .  she continues to cuddle it  but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort . 
this is a racist movie ,  but worthy of study and enjoyment .  first time through it the natural inclination is to focus on erbe & dad .  they have a relaxed ,  peaceful thing going ,  what with her still at home about to graduate from high school ,  and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something .  second time through you realize how horribly the sister's husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar .  he takes it ,  it's the thing to do these days ,  and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather .  in that same scene the sister's blues song is a real tear-jerker if you're the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music .  her performance feels like the climax of the story ;  a blues story with the good guys being  " people of color "  in their element in backwoods ,  sc .  meanwhile ,  all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies .  that's cool ,  long as you recognize it as fiction . 
i have enjoyed criminal intent series of law and order for a long time .  kathryn erbe ,  det .  alexandra eames ,  the female detective is rather hard and seems a bit bitter in the criminal intent series .  see her other side in this movie .   this movie shows the marvelous soft side of this talented actresses and if you are a criminal intent fan this movie is a revelry in her acting and you get a pretty darn good yarn of family hardships in the south .   i did not like albert finneys role in this movie because he did such a convincing acting job of the older southern fellow that is hard headed and intolerant and unaccepting of change .  he reminds me of so many men from my youth and the portrayal is divine ,  but you will likely find him hard to like in this movie .   katryn erbe is easy to like in this movie and why i recommend it as a 10 star for criminal intent ,  law and order fans . 
i liked this a lot .  in fact ,  if i see it again ( and i plan to )  i just may love it .  i'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch .  it starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it .  you just get into it .   i really liked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole .  the characters have a strong element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take .    i am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this-there are obscure tv movies that have more comments then rich in love .   one thing that i will say is i missed the ending which is driving me crazy and i have to watch it again to see that .  this is a movie that may not be for everybody but that i feel is strongly underrated ( even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is haven't seen this )  and it doesn't even seem to have much of a message board but i liked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery ,  atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably take a look at this .  especially note worthy is that it takes place in south carolina so for those  ( like me )  who love the south ,  and movies that take place there ,  this is a gem .  i'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known flick . 
 " rich in love "  is a slice-of-life film which takes the viewer into the goings on of a somewhat quirky charleston ,  sc family .  highly romanticized ,  beautifully shot ,  well written and acted ,   " ril "  washes over you like a summer breeze as its plotless meandering breathes life into the characters such that at film's end you'll feel like an old friend of the family .   a wonderfully crafted character-driven film from the director of  " driving miss daisy "  ,   " ril "  is a somewhat obscure little  " sleeper "  which will appeal most to mature audiences . 
steely ,  powerful gangster supreme frankie diomede  ( the always terrific lee van cleef in fine rugged form )  has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a traitorous partner sans detection .  fawning goofball small-time hood and wiseguy wannabe tony breda  ( an amiable portrayal by tony lo bianco )  gets busted as well .  frank and tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars .  tony helps frank break out of the joint and assists him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the ruthless louis annunziata  ( smoothly played by jean rochefort )  .  director michele lupo ,  working from an absorbing script by sergio donati and luciano vincenzoni ,  relates the neat story at a constant brisk pace ,  sustains a suitably gritty ,  but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout ,  and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip-snorting brio  ( a rough'n'tumble jailhouse shower brawl and a protracted mondo destructo car chase rate as the definite thrilling highlights )  .  van cleef and lo bianco display a nice ,  loose and engaging on-screen chemistry ;  the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching .  the ravishing edwige fenech alas isn't given much to do as tony's whiny girlfriend orchidea ,  but at least gets to bare her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much-appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene .  riz ortolani's groovy ,  pulsating ,  syncopated funk/jazz score certainly hits the soulfully swingin' spot .  the polished cinematography by joe d'amato and aldo tonti is likewise impressive .  a really nifty and entertaining little winner . 
i scooped up this title by accident with the grindhouse vol .  1 collection of pure euro-trash movies .  but this movie has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there .  stupednous it is not .  .  .  satisfying it is !  watching this movie i couldn't help to wonder .  .  .  how come sergio martino didn't make this flick ?  this has his signature all over it and punctuated by edwedge fenech  ( alas not as well known as she should be but she did get a nice cameo in hostel ii )  .  double-crosses and triple-crosses underly and cement this film from beginning to end with lee van cleef oozing coolness under pressure from the 1st second .  did this guy have to go to italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let this guy slip through ?  besides lee's more recognizable films ,  film-goers should try this on for size and see how if sergio leone would've lowered his epic scale down on once upon a time in america to half the running time  ( and 1/4 of the budget )  this is what it would've turned out to be like .  so refreshing ,  it should be taken in during the day at home and make it for an couch matinée
frankie dio  ( lee vancleef )  is a high-ranking mobster who turns himself in to the police or illegal gambling  ( for reasons that seem unclear to me )  .  tony  ( tony lo bianco )  is a low-level thug who frequents a pool hall and spends his free time envying frankie .  by being in the right place at the right time ,  tony gets arrested with frankie and is sent to jail .  .  .  where they form a bond that may not quite be friendship ,  but it will do for now .   this film came to me under the title of  " frank and tony "  ,  which is disappointing because i see an alternate name is  " mean frank and crazy tony "  ,  which would have helped sell the film more effectively .  i presume that's an homage to  " dirty mary ,  crazy larry "  but what do i know ?  i watched it shortly after another italian crime film ,   " violent professionals "  ,  and i must say the two complement each other very well .   italians have always lagged behind americans in their budgets and production values ,  which is a real shame with this film .  it is considered a  " grindhouse "  film ,  which unfairly demotes it to a b-movie  ( or worse )  .  with a cleaner sound and picture ,  this could have been a hollywood hit ,  i suspect .  i found the story very interesting ,  the characters  ( and actors )  better than average and unlike  " violent professionals "  the plot is fairly clear -- not too many secondary characters .   if you like mafia movies or crime films you should give this one a try .  a film about the mob that's actually from italy  ( how much more authentic do you want ?  )  is as much as you can ask .  sure ,  it's not  " the godfather "  ,  but it's not supposed to be .  this isn't a drama ,  it's a light comedy ,  heavy action buddy film .  .  .  like  " die hard with a vengeance "  from the point of view of the bad guys .  well ,  okay ,  not really .   if nothing else ,  this film made me want to check out other films from the director and the principle cast .  films besides  " escape from new york "   ( where vancleef plays  " hauk "  )  and the usual cult movies .  what's more fun than discovering a lost classic ? 
although i'm grateful this obscure gem of 70's italian exploitation cinema features in the recently released  " grindhouse experience "  box set ,  and although it's also available on disc under the misleading and stupid alternate title  " escape from death row "  ,  i honestly think it deserves a proper and luxurious dvd edition ,  completely in its originally spoken languages with subtitle options  ( the dubbing is truly horrible )  ,  restored picture quality and a truckload of special bonus features !  heck ,  i don't even need the restored picture quality and bonus features if only we could watch the film in its original language .   " mean frank and crazy tony "  is a cheerfully fast-paced mafia/crime flick with a lot of violence ,  comedy  ( which ,  admittedly ,  doesn't always work )  ,  feminine beauty and two witty main characters .  tony lo bianco is terrific as the small thug pretending to be the city's biggest don .  when the real crime lord frankie dio  ( lee van cleef )  arrives in town ,  he sees an opportunity to climb up the ladder by offering his services .  frankie initially ignores the little crook ,  but they do eventually form an unlikely team when frankie's entire criminal empire turns against him and a new french criminal mastermind even assassinates frankie's innocent brother .  tony helps frankie to escape from prison and together they head for marseille to extract frankie's revenge .  the script of this sadly neglected crime gem funnily alters gritty action & suspense with light-headed bits of comedy ,  like the grotesque car chase through the narrow french mountain roads for example .  the build up towards the typical mafia execution sequences  ( guided by an excellent riz ortolani score )  are extremely tense and the actual killings are sadistic and merciless ,  which is probably why the film is considered to be somewhat of a grindhouse classic .  the film lacks a strong female lead ,  as the lovely and amazingly voluptuous beauty edwige fenech sadly just appears in a couple of scenes ,  and then still in the background .  on of the men behind the camera ,  responsible for the superb cinematography ,  was no less then joe d'amato .  great film ,  highly recommended to fans of italian exploitation ,  and i hope to watch it again soon in its original version . 
i had never heard of leos carax until his merde segment in last years tokyo ,  and his was easily the stand-out the film's three stories .  it wasn't my favorite of the shorts ,  but it was the most unique ,  and the most iconic .   " the lovers on the bridge "  was the first of his full length features i've seen ,  a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic .  though he's classified as a neo-nouvelle vogue ,  his films owe as much to silent cinema as the 60's experimental narratives .  his movies are closer to jean vigo in  " l'atlante "  ,  jean cocteau ,  and guy maddin ,  than godard and truffaut .   in boy meets girl carax's 1984 debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states .  he combines the exaggerated worlds of maddin ,  but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like cocteau ,  but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible ,  emotional ,  and engaging like vigo's movies .   the story of boy meets girl is simple ,  and similar to carax's two following films which comprise this  " young lovers "  trilogy .  a boy named alex played by denis lavant  ( who plays a character named alex in carax's next two movies )  ,  has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend .  in the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder .  he walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex ,  and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate .  he steals records for her and leaves them at his friend's apartment ,  but avoids contacting either of them directly .  he wanders around and finds his way to a party ,  where he meets a suicidal young woman ,  and the film becomes part  " breathless "  and part  " limelight "  .   later he is advised by an old man with sign language to  " speak up for yourself .  .  . young people today it's like they forgot how to talk .  "  the old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film ,  and how an actor timid off stage became a confident  " lion "  when in front of the camera .  heres where the movie tips its hand ,  but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene ,  since it overlaps the style of the film  ( silent and expressionist )  ,  with the content  ( a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to )  .  though alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end ,  he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which aren't easy to nail down from moment to moment ,  aside from a desire to fall in love .   there is a scene in the film where alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies ,  all crying in a chorus that fills that room ,  until he turns on a tape of a children's show making them fall silent .  unexpectedly due a glitch the tv ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses .  even as carax is self-reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell  ( the room full of whining infants )  ,  he's mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses .  even the rich old ,  bell of the ball has a brother she misses .  in another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silence .   though indebted to films before talkies ,  carax is a master of music ,  knowing when to pipe in the dead kennedy's  " holiday in cambodia "  ,  or an early david bowie song ,  the sounds of a man playing piano ,  or of a girl softly humming .   in boy meets girl ,  when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt ,  when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin 360 degrees as if attached to a carousel ,  when alex enters a party an feels out of place ,  its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance ;  like the famous author who can't speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain ,  or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut .  this film is the missing link between jean piere jenuet ,  michel gondry ,  and wes anderson ,  whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy ,  all have a parallel with different visuals ,  musical ,  and emotional cues in these carax movies .   every line of dialog ,  every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level ,  some i lack words to articulate .  there are many tales of a boy meeting a girl ,  but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment .  the other movies you want to watch can wait .  see this first .  if i were to make films ,  i would want them to be like this ,  in fact i wish all films were like this ,  where the ephemeral becomes larger than life ,  and life itself becomes a dream . 
put yourself into carla's shoes .  she is an overworked ,  unappreciated administrative drudge who is invisible .  you know her :  she's trained three of her last three bosses ,  knows where all of the bodies are buried and might even look back at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth .  always having time for another thankless task and does it better than most despite a serious disability ,  she has the desk on the way to the restroom that becomes the repository of half-finished cups of coffee begging to be spilled .  what ?  you don't want to hear it ?  well ,  she can't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place .  prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired .   carla  ( emmanuelle devos )  needs a change in her life .  work is leading nowhere ;  friends are relying on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed .  she won't take a vacation - a contract is going critical - so the only alternative is to hire an assistant .  carla submits requirements that convey her real needs :  a 'well-groomed' man .  this brings an applicant for approval that reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes .    paul  ( vincent cassell )  does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates carla's interest in his non-job-related qualities .  she sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds ,  their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of co-dependence .    paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside of prison walls and finds himself in another sort of prison :  one of the office variety and another of indentured servitude to pay off an old debt .  his skills as a thief help carla win a political battle in the office .  but paul sees a grander opportunity with carla's skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intrigue .   this is a brutal film noir unrated and probably suitable for older teens .  carla grows more powerful ,  professionally as well as personally ,  as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us .  she grows as a woman discovering her sensual side while she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a man's world .   the two main characters are meant for each other ,  in a strange way .  without paul ,  carla will remain in her role of a doormat .  she has our sympathy ,  hopes and best wishes even if she doesn't make the best decisions along the way .    you will hear the world through carla's ears ,  from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid ,  muffled sounds ,  all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who's talking .  with one major sense disabled ,  we see carla's heightened intuitive power to compensate .  and we can all use that sense to hear not only what people say ,  but also what they really mean . 
if ,  unlike some of the commenters here ,  you are not staging a class war and don't mind seeing the lives of other people who are fairly successful ,  extroverted ,  bohemian  ( gasp )  and not being terribly english at a party and getting into all sorts of trouble as a result this is not a bad film ,  closer to euro cinema rather than an imitation of the usual slick american crap .  .  .  i believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making ,  i'd defend this ,  the film isn't any worse as a result ,  and it puts the spotlight on the cast ,  some of whom are really good  ( kate hardie- think that's her name ,  as the sarcastic drunk is spot-on )  the one exception being david baddiel ,  who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff !  !  it's light ,  and we don't go for this kind of anatomising-of-relationship crap in this country ,  but if you don't have any real friends to go to a party with than you could do worse than to sit in and watch this . 
wwe armageddon ,  december 17 ,  2006 -- live from richmond coliseum ,  richmond ,  va   kane vs .  mvp in an inferno match :  so this is the fourth ever inferno match in the wwe and it is kane vs .  mvp  ( wonder why was it the first match on the card )  .  i only viewed the ending parts where kane sets mvp's ass on fire as they're on the apron and then mvp is running around the arena while yelling  eventually the refs put out the fire with a fire extinguisher as mvp sprawls around the entrance ramp .  funny and visually quite entertaining ending .  7/10  wwe tag team championship :  this was originally supposed to be william regal & dave taylor vs .  brian kendrick & paul london  ( c )  in a regular tag team match .  however ,  gm teddy long comes to the ring and announces that it's going to be a fatal 4-way tag team ladder match .  mnm and the hardys are thrown in and it's all chaos .  one word to describe this eye-opener  wow .  man ,  i really can't remember how many sick spots there were in this match and words can't really do it justice .  there was one particularly notable spot where the hardys set up a ladder in a see-saw position and jeff jumped off the top rope while matt held mnm for the kill ,  and then wham !  nitro blew away while mercury apparently botched it and was bleeding like hell with lacerations over his face .  he had to be taken away and nitro continued the match alone .  another spot was when jeff powerbombed london while flipping off the ladder .  there were other high-flying breathtaking spots too many to remember .  london finally unbuckles the belts to win this rave show-stealer .  8 . 5/10  the boogeyman vs .  the miz :  the two men get thrown in and around the ring until boogeyman explodes a sit-out powerbomb for the victory and then and drools worms over the miz's mouth as usual .  5 . 5/10 for this three-minute incognito .   united states championship :  chris benoit  ( c )  faces off chavo guerrero in yet another typical guerrero match .  some good spots included a superplex off the top rope by chavo and an unusually long chain of german suplexes by benoit .  vicki guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to nail benoit but benoit scares her off and takes a long time deciding whether to put her in a sharpshooter or not .  this allows chavo to go for a roll-up but benoit rolls it up once more and chavo is locked in the sharpshooter .  game over .  nice hard-fought battle albeit slow at times .  7/10  wwe cruiserweight championship :  gregory helms  ( c )  vs .  jimmy wang yang for this one ,  in a fairly moderate-paced match .  the match had some good high-flying spots  most notably helms' moves off the top rope  but the crowd didn't seem to be into it after witnessing the ladder match ,  and yang needs to get more airborne .  helms won the match after blowing yang away with a facebuster on the knee .  7 . 5/10  the undertaker vs .  mr .  kennedy in a last ride match :  after a series of matches between these two ,  this time it is a last ride match ,  the second ever of its kind and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse .  pretty good indeed for what these two could offer .  kennedy manhandled a good deal of taker and even broke free of a chokeslam to throw taker off the armageddon set about 15 feet below ;  and thank god for kennedy ,  otherwise it would've been brutal .  kennedy almost got the win until taker got back up inside the hearse  ( i liked the camera view inside the hearse )  .  taker then missed a steel pipe hurl on kennedy and broke the hearse's window instead ,  but then later busted kennedy open with a chair ,  and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and tombstone on the hearse's roof .  kennedy was unconscious and taker drove him out of the arena to win .  i actually found myself really interested into these guys' willingness to take/give real sick shots .  7 . 5/10  santa comes into the ring ,  i go  " what the hell ?  "  like many of the kids in the crowd ,  and then the word  " lingerie contest "  gets in my ear .  break time .   batista & john cena vs .  finlay & king booker :  talk about charisma vs .  technicality .  this match was actually a quite good main event with the momentum rationally shifting from one team to the other and retaining good suspense .  even finlay got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time  ( i kind of doubted his strength against the champs )  ,  and him and booker mainly didn't succeed in trying to cheat  except at one point where booker rammed his scepter into cena's throat .  batista hits the bomb on booker for the win ,  didn't get to see the f-u ;  cena performed the 5 knuckle shuffle anyhow and i think he also did the stfu .  this was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder 7 . 5/10 .   being an on-and-off wwe fan ,  i have to agree that armageddon was laced up with numerous eye-catchers throughout ,  and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show ;  the last ride match featured some fairly nerve-wrenching spots ,  and the main event also did very well for its category .  all other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the boogeyman vs .  the miz bout and the ever-useless lingerie contest .  overall armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay-per-view and despite some big setbacks earlier in the ppv chronology ,  armageddon wishes this year's goodbye respectably .  ppv rating :  8/10 . 
armageddon ppv  the last ppv of 2006  smackdown brand .   match results ahead********  we are starting the show with the inferno match .  kane v .  mvp .  this was an okay match .  nothing about wrestling here .  this was about the visuals .  overall ,  this was not bad .  there were a few close spots here with kane getting too close to the fire ,  but in the end ,  kane won with ramming mvp into the fire back first .   nice opener .  let's continue .   teddy long announces a new match for the tag team titles :  london and kendrick will defend against :  regal and taylor ,  the hardyz ,  and mnm in a ladder match !  !  !  !  let's get moving !   match two :  fatal four way ladder match .  this was total carnage .  judging by three out of the four teams here ,  you would expect chaos .  the spots were amazing .  a total spot-fest .  one point jeff went for poetry in motion and london moved and jeff hit the ladder !  shortly afterword ,  jeff is set on the top rope with two ladders nearby as mnm were going to kill jeff ,  matt makes the save and jeff hits the  " see-saw "  shot to joey mercury !  mercury is hurt .  his eye is shut quickly and is busted open hard way .  mercury is taken out of the match and nitro is still there .  he is going to fight alone for the titles !  regal and taylor then grab london and suplex him face-first into the ladder !  jeff climbs the ladder and nitro in a killer spot ,  dropkicks through the ladder to nail jeff !  awesome !  in the end ,  london and kendrick retain the tag team titles .  what a match !  !  !   this was insane .  i can't figure out why wwe did not announce this till now .  the buyrate would increase huge .  i'm sure the replay value will be good though .   mercury has suffered a shattered nose and lacerations to the eye .  he is at the hospital now .  get well kid .   no way anything else here will top that .   next up :  the miz v .  boogeyman .  ( ugh )  this was a nothing match .  will the boogeyman ever wrestle ?  the miz sucks too .  after a insane crowd ,  this kills them dead .  dud .   chris benoit v .  chavo .  this was a strong match .  i enjoyed it .  chavo hit a killer superplex at one point !  benoit hit eight german suplexes too !  benoit wins with the sharpshooter .  good stuff .   helms v .  yang-cruiserweight title championship match .  this was a good match .  unfortunately ,  the stupid fans did not care for this .  why ?  helms and yang are very talented and wrestled well .  i agree with jbl .  he ranted to the crowd .  jbl is 100% correct .  learn to appreciate this or get out .    mr .  kennedy v .  the undertaker-last ride match .  not too much here .  this was a slug fest ,  with a few exceptions .  kennedy at one point tossed taker off the top of the stage to the floor .  the spot was fine .  reaction was disappointing .  the end spot was taker tomb-stoned kennedy on the hearse and won the match .  unreal .  kennedy needed this win .  they both worker hard .  still ,  kennedy needed this win .  undertaker should have lost .  creative screwed up again .   a stupid diva thing is next .  i like women .  not this .  at least torrie was not here .  that's refreshing .  judging from the crowd ,  layla should have won .  the wwe wanted ashley .  consider this your bathroom break .  next .   main event :  cena & batista v .  finlay & booker t .  this was also a nothing match .  the focus was cena v .  finlay and batista v .  booker .  batista and booker can't work well together .  finlay tries to make cena look good .  the finish was botched .  finlay hit batista's knee with a chair shot and batista no-sold the shot and finished the match .  lame .  not main event caliber at all .   overall ,  armageddon would have scored less ,  but the ladder match was the main event here .  that was enough money's worth right there .  a few others were solid .    the last word :  a good ppv with the ladder match being the savior .  smackdown is not a bad show just is not compelling enough .  smackdown needs to stop letting cena tag along .  let smackdown stand on their own two legs .  this show proves that smackdown can . 
wwe's last ppv of 2006 ,  proved to be a hit with the fans ,  but for one reason only ,  the ladder match which was only scheduled to be paul london and brian kendrick against william regal and dave taylor .  but with the recent crap ppv being december to dismember ,  wwe knew that it had to do something to get the fans talking again ,  this proved useful when it introduced mnm and the hardy boyz to the mix and announced that the match was going to be a ladder match .   the match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches i have ever seen ,  but joey mercury's face was a total mess .  johnny nitro didn't even check on his partner ,  they just carried on like nothing happened ,  and taylor and regal did nothing during the match except hit people with a few ladder shots .  in the end london and kendrick retained the titles .   elsewhere on the show kane defeated mvp in a decent inferno match when he set mvp's stupid costume on fire .  chris benoit downed chavo guerrero in a decent match ,  gregory helms defeated jimmy wang yang to retain the wwe cruiserweight title in a solid effort .   but the main event was a total mess ,  king booker teamed with finlay to take on john cena and batista .  the action was shoddy and no one cared who batista picked for his partner .   overall results :  kane defeated mvp in an inferno match .   paul london and brian kendrick retained the wwe tag team titles against the hardy boyz ,  mnm and david taylor and william regal in a ladder match .   chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero to retain the us title in a decent match .   gregory helms defeated jimmy wang yang to retain the cruiserweight championship .   the boogeyman beat the miz in a terrible match .   the undertaker defeated mr kennedy in a last ride match .   john cena and batista defeated king booker and finlay in an abysmal match .   overall grade - b
wwe has produced some of the worst pay-per-views in its history over the past few months .  cyber sunday ,  survivor series and december to dismember were appalling to say the least and so it was relying on its b brand show ,  smackdown !  to attempt to end the year on a high note .  armageddon had two major gimmick matches in the last ride and inferno matches ,  three championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring batista and john cena against king booker and finlay .  however ,  it was an amendment to one of those championship matches that brought us not only the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when teddy long gave us fans an early christmas present .  t-lo changed the wwe tag team championship match from champions ,  london and kendrick against to regal and taylor to a four team ladder match including mnm and the hardy boyz .   i am not going to dwell on this match too much as nothing i can say would be able to do it justice .  this has to be seen to be believed .  there were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings .  the one move i have to talk about however was the one that took joey mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest .  jeff hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with matt hardy holding both members of mnm over the opposite end of it to take the full force .  unfortunately for mercury he didn't get his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye .  this was vicious .  his face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended mercury's night early .  we found out later he suffered a broken nose and cuts under his left eye .  be warned .  this is not for the faint of heart .  the ending to this roller-coaster of a match came after paul london managed to grab both championship belts for the victory .  i have been watching wrestling for almost 15 years and it doesn't get any better than this match .  unbelievable .   the night opened with only the 4th ever inferno match .  kane took on mvp in a good match but it was all about the visual and not really about the action .  there were a few close calls with the flames for both competitors but in the end it was kane who forced mvp onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring .  mvp ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was a sick part of me that laughed watching this .  may i suggest to michael hayes that mvp comes out next week on smackdown !  to johnny cash's ring of fire .   the other gimmick match of the night ,  and the second match of a triple main event was an all out war last ride match between mr kennedy and the undertaker .  this was a stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series undertaker and kennedy have had yet .  the used poles ,  chairs and one scene had the undertaker thrown 15 feet from the armageddon set onto what was suppose to be the concrete floor .  unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing but a crash mat and crowd didn't pop for this .  the ending came after a chokeslam by the dead man to kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a match-winning tombstone .   in other notable happening from the card .  chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero by submission in another stiff match .  this was a very good bout with benoit hitting 8 german suplexes on chavo at one time .  benoit was also considering whether to put vikki guerrero in the sharpshooter or not .  luckily he came to his senses and let her go .  this led to chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submission .   another cracking match on the card was the cruiserweight championship contest between the longest reigning champion in wwe ,  gregory helms and jimmy wang yang .  featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spots ,  some of which took place outside the ring ,  this was a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got .  jbl put it best when he berated the fans in richmond ,  virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started a boring chant .  helms picked up the duke after a jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knees to smackdowns !  resident redneck .   the boogeyman pinned the miz in a worthless match .  i hate the boogeyman with a passion .  only worth listening too for jbl's ranting about miz .  jbl is comedy gold .   the last match of the night was main event number 3 .  world heavyweight champion ,  batista and wwe champion ,  john cena teamed up to take on finlay and the champion of champions ,  king booker .  there was no way the match could top the tag team championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the less .  the match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have i said that about wwe matches this year already .  it was king booker who was pinned at the end of the match after a big batistabomb .   so 2006 is over for the wwe in regards to it's pay-per-view schedule .  it started the year on a terrible note with new year's revolution but ended on a high one with armageddon .  this ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time .  my hat is off to all eight competitors who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of a match . 
tis is a farly typical tom and jerry short-a situation is designed ,  conflict arises and mayhem ensues .  the characters behave in appropriate ways ,  the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos .  the best  ( and funniest )  part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected-all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes .  a word of warning-it is most unwise to allow tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine !  highly recommended . 
without being one of my favorites ,  this is good for being a change of pace .  .  .  even if only for a few minutes .   it all starts with a big fight between tom ,  jerry and spike  ( who is renamed  " butch "  here )  .  they're all beating each other ,  but suddenly spike makes a heroic and admirable decision :  he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends .  so ,  all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends .  .  .  which isn't going to last for long .   meanwhile ,  the three become affectionate ,  patient and kind to each other .  they even save each other when one of them is in danger of life .  the relationship goes nothing but excellent ,  until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy .  the three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalries .   but still .  .  .  to see tom ,  jerry and spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience ,  even if only for a while .   oh ,  by the way ,  as a curious fact ,  two songs from  " the wizard of oz "  are played here in instrumental versions :   " we're off to see the wizard "  and  " somewhere over the rainbow "  . 
tom the cat ,  jerry the mouse ,  and spike the dog  ( here called butch ,  his third name ,  his second being 'killer' )  decide to sign a peace treaty to all love each other .  it's weird and a bit unnatural seeing them all buddy buddy like this and their friend's seem to think so too .  but by the end thanks to a disagreement over a steak ,  everything is back to normal and all is how it should be .  this short is the second one of three on the new spotlight dvd to be edited and i have no clue why this one was .  this cartoon can be found on disc one of the spotlight collection dvd of  " tom & jerry "    my grade :  b
this film seems to be well remembered as the time tom & jerry signed a peace treaty .  things are idyllic for a time but ,  predictably ,  it goes sour .  probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight involving a pipe ,  a frying pan ,  and a baseball bat that the two plus butch the dog engage in at the beginning and end of the short .  i enjoyed one a bunch and you should try to catch it on cartoon network . 
butch the peacemaker ?  evidently .  after the violent beginning with spike ,  tom and jerry all swinging away at each other ,  butch calls a halt and wants to know why .  it's a good question .    " cats can get along with dogs ,  can't they ?  "  he asks tom ,  who nods his head in agreement .   " mice can get along with cats ,  right ?  "  jerry nods  " no ,  "  and then sees that isn't the right answer .   they go inside and butch draws up a  " peace treaty "   ( complete with professional artwork !  )  .  most of the rest ,  and the bulk of the cartoon ,  is the three of them being extremely nice to one another what a refreshing change-of-pace .  i found it fun to watch .  i can a million of these cartoons in which every beats each other over the head .   anyway ,  you knew the peace wasn't going to last .  a big piece of steak spells the death of the  " peace treaty "  but en route it was nice change and still had some of usual tom & jerry clever humor . 
as in amelie ,  recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship slant ,  centered on a female finding her one true love .  in this case ,  desperation leads to a convict ,  which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype .  clever and surprising story in many ways ,  except that the female is there to support the male .   for those of us that don't speak french ,  the subtitles are a little quick ,  but not unreasonable .   the soundtrack ,  as seems to be increasingly the case with european films ,  is great and in perfect sync with the film's variations .  nothing seems forced .  visually ,  it reminds me of various urban horror movies .  there's a wes craven in chicago feel to it . 
if you are a fan ,  then you will probably enjoy this .  if you don't know who misty mundae ,  darian caine ,  ruby larocca ,  or seduction cinema are ,  this is not the movie to start out with .  it's very cute ,  silly ,  the girls are hot ,  and it's fun to watch .  there's no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45 minute film ,  but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot's not a total bore .  misty mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids ,  so she's not as hot in this as she has been in others .  but her panties in this are quite cute  ( you'll just have to see the movie for that to not sound really weird )  .  if you do like this one ,  you will probably enjoy  " that 70's girl "  ,   " vampire vixens "  ,  or  " erotic survivor "   ( which is a bit more sexually graphic )  .  if you prefer watching misty or esmerelda in less sexual ,  more horror/exploitation-based  ( but lower budget )  movies ,  check out the factory 2000 website . 
metro-goldwyn-mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market .  this market is essentially dominated by the looney tunes and the merry melodies shorts ,  coming from warner bros .  but mgm is also able of releasing hidden gems ,  like  " to spring "  ,  an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year .   in the environment depicted here ,  spring isn't caused by natural cycles ,  but is fabricated .  and by who ?  by little male elves who live below ground .  each spring ,  when the snow begins to melt ,  they start working .  they begin by felling rainbow rock columns ,  then reducing them to rubble and using this rubble to turn it into color fluids ,  which will be moved up to the ground and bearing grass ,  flowers .  .  .  in other words ,  spring !  the first half of the cartoon depicts spring's fabrication ,  but the second part is a little bit different .  old man winter comes back and he tries to extend winter by destroying the elves' work .  so from this point ,  we assist to a battle between the elves and old man winter .   the music heard here is deliciously wonderful .  the melodic parts stick in the head like an ink spot on a paper sheet .  the second part melodies are thrilling and they perfectly fit with the action .  this is just fantastico ,  giorgio !  the animation sequences are also a delight .  the colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown into a massive ,  epic environment .  the concept itself is brilliant .  the elves are attracting characters ,  so is old man winter ,  who effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season .   there's also a strong message included here .  the battle seems lost for the elves at the end ,  until a single late arriving elf jump into the action and it leads to the elves' victory over winter .  so the point is :  only one single person can make the difference .   in conclusion ,   " to spring "  is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era .  what is even more remarkable is that this cartoon's director made his debut here .  and who is  " to spring " 's director ?  it's a certain william hanna .  .  . 
this cartoon is short on plot ,  but is a visually stunning piece of work .  there will be very ,  very minor spoilers :    this short has a  " story "  that's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year ,  yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw .  both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs .  that's pretty much the plot ,  such as it is .  but this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation .  the visuals are exceptional .  back in 1936 ,  such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here .   my favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes .  at more than one point ,  there are a series of pipes aligned in a row ,  from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ .   the visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed .  these types of shorts were things which hugh harman and rudolf ising are noted for ,  but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from mgm ,  because this cartoon probably went over budget and mgm finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than harman and ising were .   this is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing .  it's available on the dvd attack of the '30s characters .  recommended ,  particularly if you like good animation . 
i am sad to say that i disagree with other people on this columbo episode .  death lends a hand is frankly kind of a boring columbo to me .  after a few times ,  i get bored and changed the channel .  i still love robert culp and patricia crowley and ray milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others .  first ,  robert culp plays an investigator for ray milland's character .  he hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by patricia crowley to see if she is having an affair .  in return ,  culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career .  out of anger ,  culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere .  i don't know .  maybe i just didn't care for this one at all .  of course ,  columbo gets him in the end .  it's just the question of how . 
 " death lends a hand "  is one of the pivotal early episodes of  " columbo "  that helped define the show for the next thirty years .  it marks the first of robert culp's four appearances  ( three as a murderer )  ,  playing much the same role in each show .   in this case culp plays brimmer ,  the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate ,  mr kennicut ,  is having an affair .  although she is ,  brimmer decides not to tell kennicut ,  in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in return for snippets of information about her husband's business associates .  she reacts badly to this suggestion ,  an argument ensues which rapidly turns violent as brimmer whacks her across the face .  because he is wearing a large ring ,  the blow knocks her to the ground and kills her .   there are some really priceless moments in this episode .  one of my favourite scenes is where columbo pretends to be into palm-reading ,  although this is in fact a ruse to discover the shape and size of brimmer's ring without admitting that he knows the killer wore a ring .  columbo being columbo ,  he only reveals what he really knows when the time is exactly right to turn the screws a little .  so initially he goofily plays the part of a rather simple-minded man who gets excited by the  " lifeline going over the mound of the moon "  ,  or some equally ridiculous palm-reading mumbo-jumbo .   another great scene is when brimmer tries to offer columbo a job for his firm ,  effectively bribing him to stop poking his nose around .  again ,  columbo doesn't reveal that he knows what's going on ,  he pretends to be honoured and excited by this job offer .   and there's another where columbo says to kennicut ,  in front of brimmer ,  that he wishes the murderer could hear their conversation .  he wants to hint to brimmer that he is onto him ,  without directly accusing him ,  so he rather cruelly  ( but understandable in the circumstances )  decides to play mindgames on brimmer in order to spook him into panicking and doing something stupid .  which of course he does !  all the while ,  the grieving kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation .  it's only near the end that columbo explains all to kennicut  ( not shown on screen )  .   i won't reveal how columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights ,  but let's just say there's a potato involved .  .  .    a really really good episode ,  possibly the very best of the first series .  if you liked this then you'll like  " double exposure "  too ,  also featuring robert culp . 
this is one of the first and best columbos ,  starring robert culp and ray milland .  robert culp appeared on another columbo ,  as did several other villains ,  including patrick mcgoohan ,  william shatner ,  and jack cassidy .  ray milland also made a later appearance .   in this one ,  ray milland is convinced his beautiful wife ,  played by patricia crowley ,  is having an affair ,  so he hires culp to investigate .  culp has a blackmailing business on the side ,  so he gives milland a fake report and threatens crowley with the real one if she doesn't pay up .  they get into a huge fight in culp's home ,  and she winds up murdered .  enter columbo .   culp does everything he can to get columbo off the case ,  including offering him a job ,  but columbo is on to him from the beginning .   excellent episode . 
this was the first regular filmed columbo movie episode but yet it aired as the second ,  after steven spielberg's  " columbo :  murder by the book "  .  it's also at the same time among one of the better ones !   bernard l .  kowalski was one great creative director !  no wonder that they later asked him to direct three more columbo movies .  the movie has some real creative and innovative shot sequences and the movie as a whole is also clearly made with style ,  passion and eye for detail .  every shot connects and is a reason why this movie is better and also better looking just any other average made for tv movie .  it's definitely one of the better directed columbo movies .   it's a quit original columbo entry for a couple of reasons .  the murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act .  so the killer this time doesn't have any time to plan out the 'perfect murder' in advance and his to clean up any of the traces afterward and has to dispose the body .  the killer in this movie is not only being handled as the man who committed the crime but more as the man who helps out lieutenant columbo to solve the murder .  it makes the character a more interesting and layered one as well and also helps to make the way columbo solves the whole crime seem way more interesting as well because of that .  of course columbo starts to suspect him pretty early on and as always he comes to solution by making himself vulnerable and look more stupid than he of course truly is and by gaining the killer's trust .  this is obviously no spoiler since this is the way every columbo movie gets set-up .  i liked the story of the movie and how it progressed .   it also helps the movie that it has such a fine cast .  at the time of this movie peter falk had really made the columbo character his own and the character at this was already fully developed .  robert culp is truly great as the short tempered brimmer .  funny thing is that he would later star in three different columbo movies again and one  " mrs .  columbo "  episode ,  only in totally different roles .  he even played the murderer in a couple of those movies as well again .  he by the way was not the only actor that did this in other later columbo movies .  also the great ray milland makes an appearance in this movie ,  as the husband of the victim .   all in all ,  a real great early columbo movie and among the better ones out of the long running series of movies .   9/10
the second official episode of the  " columbo "  series  (  " murder by the book ,  "  filmed later ,  hit the airwaves first )  .  robert culp ,  who would match wits with peter falk's detective in several future installments ,  is terrific as the short-tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency who murders a client's wife when she refuses to cave-in to his blackmail schemes .  the two stars are well-matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series . 
this was the second entry in the regular columbo series ,  and it holds up well today .  as i am able to look at it closely now on dvd and see how it is constructed ,  i am very impressed with the direction of bernard l .  kowalski  ( who directed the fine macho callahan as well as countless tv episodes ) --watch how the post-murder actions of the killer are shown on a split-screen effect on his two eyeglasses ,  watch how the murder itself is shown in montage fashion ,  watch the point-of-view shot from the perspective of the corpse .  also ,  the wild but impressive avant-garde musical score from noted jazzman gil melle was incredible and helped so much to create atmosphere .  and the supporting performance of brett halsey as the golf pro was wonderful--such subtlety and complexity in a role that nine out of ten times would be a one-dimensional cutout .  the  " formula "  had not yet been set when this episode was filmed ,  so there are still some surprises in columbo's methods .  of course ,  falk ,  robert culp ,  and ray milland are the highest-quality actors and it's a pleasure to see them work--all men are familiar from many other roles yet lose themselves in their characters here .  in all ,  this entry in the columbo series--and many of the others--are as well-crafted as a very good feature film . 
a very high-standard columbo story which was actually the first filmed episode of the long-running series but was originally transmitted second  ( after  " murder by the book "  )  .   robert culp makes his first of three appearances as the guest murderer in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency ,  who blackmails the wife  ( patricia crowley )  of a rich ,  highly influential businessman  ( played very sympathetically by ray milland )  after he falsifies a report ,  in her favour ,  after it is discovered she was having an affair .  the wife later rebels against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a fit of rage .  .  .  .   a very satisfying episode in many respects ,  particularly as the plot is so strongly set-up and subsequently developed and also because of the rare columbo ingredient that the crime is an unpremeditated killing .  the whole thing is further enhanced when the widowed husband uses the murderer to assist columbo in his investigations :  a feature that facilitates numerous good quality scenes ,  particularly in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and columbo's crucially deceptive qualities are wonderfully in evidence .   directed with flair by bernard l .  kowalski and acted to an appropriately high level ,  this really set the tone for whole series  ( since  " murder by the book "  was let down by a poor ending )  .  the script by columbo creators richard levinson and william link is precise ,  well-structured and well-thought-out and is underpinned by a steady ,  productive pace and meaningful sequences which really exhibit the unpredictability of the story .  ultimately ,  the finale fittingly epitomises that columbo has always been one step ahead of the murderer .   overall ,  this is a very fine piece of detective work for columbo ,  and strongly suggests that the production team had worked positively and constructively to render a polished columbo story . 
what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters .  this might require a bit of patience ,  especially since neither is  " attractive "  in the typical hollywood definition of such .  however ,  once the  " heist "  kicks in ,  the film rushes forward quickly ,  perhaps at times too quickly .  but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you don't look too closely it is all quite believable .  the kind of film that you know hollywood would have botched up . 
perfect cast for a few-person drama .  simon is dead but somehow resurrects from outside .  what he had seen there is displayed in form of blank spots orchestrated to a magnificent score by german avant-garde composer werner henze .  simon is haunted by his death ,  comforted by support of death people he'd seen on the other side .  his girlfriend tries to hold him to life but failing to ,  decides to follow him after his finally occurring death .  very touchy and moving ,  deeply psychological ,  but a bit slow and somewhere even boring . 
alain resnais films are uncanny in the way that they aren't really edited for continuity ,  but instead the shot seems to finish right where a memory has edited .  love unto death is at times a quiet existential drama and a roundly creative magical realist movie ,  and either way treats the audience to a whole new aspect of the eros/thanatos relationship .  .  .  or perhaps creates a new relationship ,  that of agape/thanatos .   the beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror movie .  a woman desperately runs around the house while a man lays dying in his bed--did she kill him ,  or what happened ?  soon that tension is dissolved as a doctor arrives and pronounces him dead ,  but from there a newer ,  stranger drama begins :  the man wakes up ,  and after being dead the woman and man fall in love to actually quite tragic consequences .  meanwhile ,  their friends ,  who are both priests ,  watch on and submit their own debate into the nature of love ,  faith ,  and devotion .   resnais always seems to have some device to make these sorts of narratives work ,  and what's so amazing about his films is that those devices always work .  in this case ,  resnais intercuts the scenes with shots of snow falling to an arousing orchestral score ,  which fades off and bleeds into the subsequent shots that continue the story .  trapped in this elegiac aside periodically ,  the film develops a rhythm not too unlike an epic poem ,  and i got strange flashbacks to dante's divine comedy from this one ,  despite the lack of direct reference within the movie .  resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker but this extends past just the cinepoem structure to something that forces a degree of introspection in the viewer ,  which has the possibility to bring to surface some odd recollections .  memory-narrative ,  resnais creates .   --polarisdib
master cinéaste alain resnais likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family . in this film too we see resnais' family members like pierre arditi ,  sabine azema ,  andré dussolier and fanny ardant dealing with serious themes like death , religion , suicide , love and their overall implications on our daily lives . the formal nature of relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends ,  they address each other using a formal you . in 1984 , while making l'amour à mort , resnais dealt with time , memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence  : is love stronger than death  ?  it was 16 years ago in 1968 that resnais made a somewhat similar film je t'aime je t'aime which was also about love and memories . message of this film is loud and clear  : true and deep love can even put science to shame as dead lovers regain their lost lives leaving doctors to care for their reputation . l'amour à mort is like a game which is not at all didactic . it is a film in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images . this is one of the reasons why this film can easily be grasped . 
i used to love watching this .  i had no idea it was part of a larger series .  i must have been 6 or so at the time it was on tv .  i just thought it was funny and for some reason i had a deep fascination for something that was clear that was in the president's pile of bathtub toys .  my parents had taped this off of tv when it originally aired on nbc .  the tape even had the old sanka coffee commercial along with a few others .  i'm planning on returning home sometime soon and will try to record the tape onto my computer so that those who want a copy can do so .  if anyone of you would like to contact me ,  i think you can do that through the imdb site feel free .  i will keep you updated and let you know when i have the show in a digital format . 
i was pretty young when this came out in the us ,  but i recorded it from tv and watched it over and over again until i had the whole thing memorized .  to this day i still catch myself quoting it .  the show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters ,  from frank sinatra ,  to sylvester stallone ,  to mr .  t .  the voices were great ,  and sounded just like the characters they were portraying .  the puppets were also well done ,  although a little creepy .  i was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by rob grant and doug naylor of red dwarf ,  a show that i also enjoy very much .  like another person had written in a comment earlier ,  i too was robbed of this great show by a  " friend "  who borrowed it and never returned it .  i sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a dvd release ,  but i don't think enough people have heard of it .  oh well ,  maybe i'll try e-bay .  .  . 
it was in 1988 ,  when i saw  " the ronnie and nancy show "  for the first time  ( on austrian television )  .  at that time ,  i was already a very big fan of spitting image  ( since when it won the bronze rose of the montreux film festival in 1986 )  .  of course i recorded every show on tape and watched it again and again - especially  " the ronnie and nancy show "  .  i remember that scene when ronnie stood in front of a painting of abraham lincoln  ( thinking it was a mirror )  and said to himself  " i need a shave "  .  or most amusing of all ,  when he played ball with his dog - but vice-versa !   it's such a shame ,  that spitting image seems to fall into oblivion ;  it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent made tv-shows ever .  compared to other satirical broadcasts it was definitely the best of all .    well ,  almost 20 years have passed since then ,  and i wish i could see the show again .  is it possible to purchase it from someone .  .  .  somewhere ? 
a long time ago ,  i watched this movie from the middle on cable .  i then had a crush on mary moronov .  i saw her again in eating raoul .  i was convinced that she's the hottest woman on screen .   i maybe biased about this movie .  9 out of 10 .   this's the only movie i own on original tape . 
one of the unsung gems of the 1980's ,  scenes .  .  .  features razor-sharp satire and outstanding performances from arnetia walker  ( how did she not get a ton of roles after this ?  ) and wallace shawn .  it's a delicious send-up of class warfare and the people in those classes .  the writing is hilarious and the characters ,  while not subtle ,  are nuanced .  and ,  sorry ,  but the asian gangs  ( if you can call one japanese guy extorting one of the other characters a  " gang "  )  were not put in for  " sociological value "  as another review implies they should been .  the value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the sparklingly wicked way it does it .  i found it creative ,  funny ,  and idiosyncratic . 
often laugh out loud funny play on sex ,  family ,  and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it's seen since the days of granny and jed clampett .  plot centers on two chauffers who've bet on which one of them can bed his employer  ( both single or soon to be single ladies ,  quite sexy -- bisset and woronov )  first .  if manuel wins ,  his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses ,  he must play bottom man to his friend !    lots of raunchy dialogue ,  fairly sick physical humour ,  etc .  but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface .  bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy ,  teenaged niece on a year long  " missionary trip "  to africa .   hilarious fun . 
deaf secretary carla  ( emmanuelle devos )  is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues .   when they suggest she needs an assistant it seems like the final insult ,  but ,  when the first applicant is ex-con paul  ( vincent cassel )  she seizes the chance to change her life .   carla covers his mistakes and he ,  anxious to go straight ,  reluctantly helps her to take revenge on her colleagues .   when paul asks carla to return the favor ,  she finds herself drawn into the criminal underworld ,  ruled by ruthless lone shark marchand  ( olivier gourmet )  .   recognizing her ability to lip-read as a weapon no one will have bargained for ,  the two set out to see justice done .   french filmmaker jacques audiard's third feature  " read my lips "  is a genre-defying piece ,  switching from dark social comedy to visceral full-throttle thriller . 
saw this movie on its release and have treasured it since .  what a wonderful group of actors  ( i always find the casting one of the most interesting aspects of a film )  .  really enjoyed seeing dramatic actress jacqueline bisset in this role and wallace shawn is always a hoot .  the script is smart ,  sly and tongue-in-cheek ,  poking fun at almost everything  " beverley hills "  .  loved paul bartel's  " doctor "  and ray sharkey's manservant .  this was raunchy and crude ,  but thank god !  unless you're a prude ,  i heartily recommend this movie .  fyi for anyone who likes to play six degrees of kevin bacon ,  mary woronov & paul bartel were in  " rock & roll high school "  .  mary woronov and robert beltran were in  " night of the comet "  together .  they were all three in  " eating raoul "  . 
this movie is outrageous ,  funny ,  ribald ,  sophisticated & hits the bullseye where 99 % of hollywood movies don't even make the target .  paul bartel should be recognized as one of the great directors of this or any era .  he's the american renoir & bunuel _ combined !  !  !  glad i have the videodisc . 
this movie has great style ,  fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman .  it falters at the end as the story twists get a little bit extreme .  .  but all in all ,  i would recommend this movie just because it has that good old russian feel to it .  .  big ,  impressive ,  powerful ,  bleak and brutal and at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty .   plot :  a guy who can make a blade shoot out of his hand at will  ( not a spoiler since they show it in the trailer )  when he is really mad at you tries to have a girlfriend .  .  he discovers that after you kill one person with your sword hand ,  it's kind of hard to keep a stable relationship .  .  .  .   sword boy is on the planet for a reason .  .  he just doesn't know what it is .  .  yet .   lots of dark street fights with guys unexpectedly getting filleted creatively .   russain w eng subtitles .  .  slick worth a watch .  . 
 " read my lips  ( sur mes lèvres )  "   ( which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title )  is a nifty ,  twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope .   the two leads are magnetic ,  emmanuelle devos  ( who i've never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies )  and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel  ( who has brought a sexy and/or threatening look and voice to some us movies )  .   the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he's the neophyte .  the second half is on his turf as an ex-con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu .   writer/director jacques audiard very cleverly uses the woman's isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions ,  turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does  ( so it's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk )  ,  using visuals as sensory reactors as well .   none of the characters act as anticipated  ( she is not like that pliable victim from  " in the company of men ,  "  not in individual interactions ,  not in scenes ,  and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line  ( well ,  until the last shot ,  but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment )  as we move from a hectic modern office ,  to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake-outs .    there is a side story that's thematically redundant and unnecessary ,  but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths .   this is one of my favorites of the year !     ( originally written 7/28/2002 ) 
for everyone who expects a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise .  it is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie .  it focuses mainly on emotions and it's a bit like a greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow .   that's because sasha ,  like each superhero ,  takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn't appreciate it .  sasha becomes an outlaw .  while on the run ,  he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him .   as you can see ,  the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics .  it reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by ram gopal varma .  everything happens very slowly .  however ,  when there's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what's going on ,  it's all over .  but the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action .  what is more important here is the outcome of sasha's actions ,  which are mostly very drastic .  the score is very scarce ,  which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film .  so basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it .   is the film worth it ?  that is a question really difficult to answer .  i don't think that this experience enriched me so very much ,  but somehow i keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again .  mostly due to the atmosphere ,  which is really dense ,  but not suffocating because all the time sasha and katya have hope .  after all they're young people ,  who have all their lives to live .  so no matter how hard it gets there's always a slight joyous tune when they are together . 
a woman borough a boy to this world and was alone .  they both were alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one package - he was capable of withdrawing sword from his arm .  there was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this  " gift "  - the wound of the deadliest weapon inside of his body .  first he kills his constantly drunk stepfather who hurts his mom every time .  then he grows up and decides to find his real father .  just as simple as all the time for a superhero - he reaches the justice .  .  .  . but the society decides this justice is not necessary and dangerous which is indeed right 'cause it is not like in hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone - sasha  ( he is the main hero acted by artem tkachenko )  kills if the person who in his opinion deserves to die but gets blames from authorities and runs .  in such a runaway from authorities and mafia he meets a girl  ( acted by chulpan hamatova )  and falls in love with her .  everything else is to be watched .  .  . not told .  be aware that this film is more about feelings and emotions but not about actions .  this film is full of pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life . 
i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift ,  who was made into a monster by society .  suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got .  but it was a happy surprise .  my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic  ( the fact that the male lead isn't bad to look at surely helped )  ,  and there was enough plot development ,  action and even humor  ( the fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the movie to now each other's name had the whole movietheatre laughing )  to keep you entertained and invested in the story .  so in short :  not what i expected ,  but a very good surprise indeed .  i'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd . 
there is a lot of crap coming out of hollywood lately .   a friend ,  sends me movies now and again ,  as a surprise ,  it's awesome .   i turned it on and couldn't stop watching ,  it is a drama ,  but with a odd twist .  imagine if romeo ,  as in shakepeare ,  had a super power .  it is sad and poetic at the same time .  hollywood should take notice of the new russian cinema ,  they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi .  it takes a simple basic premise and tells a story ,  without a spectacle .  this is a lot like an asian film with a dark russian twist .  granted it's not perfect ,  but nothing ever is .  you know what the power is but it is never explained ,  nor totally realized until the end .  it becomes secondary to the emotion of the story .  i don't want to see a remake ,  it is too cool as is ,  the hollywood system would ,  as usual ,  mess it up .  acting is top notch all around .  directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there .  kudos to all involved , and i will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic .  a+++++  if you can find i ,  watch it . 
despite the title ,  the sword bearer ,  and the dvd cover  ( action/herioc poses of the sword bearer )  this is not a super hero film .    ( minor spoilers )  it follows the tale of sasha ,  the sword bearer ,  who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm .  cool you say ,  but no ,  this is real life .  if you had this power as a child could you control it when ,  say ,  faced by a mad man ,  or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her .  and if you don't control it ,  how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12 .   this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him .  wandering aimlessly after another killing  ( much like a bout de soufflé )  .  he then meet katya ,  and the pair fall instantly in love ,  providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways .  however ,  his past is still chasing him ,  in the form of two police officers .   that is essentially the story ,  and there is virtually no action on screen ,  though a lot if suggested .   i really like this movie .  unlike many hollywood 'super hero' films ,  we get very little back story ,  there is no bad guy  ( unless you count the sword bearer himself )  abut there is a lot of heart and good character development .   worth checking out if you can find it . 
what happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers ?  the premise may sound familiar .  the watchmen ?  unbreakable ?  however ,  the russian sci-fi action flick ,  the sword bearer ,  is far from the standard stock .   the story revolves around a man named sasha who as a boy was shunned from society ,  his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess .  when he wishes or his anger allows ,  a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin .  very wolverinish ?  maybe .  .  .  but that's not the interesting part of this film .  shunned all his life and driven by anger  ( and a temper he does have )  our  " hero "  returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to .  the only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flame's new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground .  this is where the vengeance and anger comes into play .  this is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail .  he meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about .   the film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences .  this is art house at it's core ,  beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci-fi action .  it's this odd mash that interests me so much in this film .  the directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of sasha and not a straight action film .  don't worry though ,  the action is there and plenty of it .  however ,  much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath .  this is not to say that action is not shown .  these scenes are here and are fantastic  ( especially the ending where we see sasha's full powers unleashed in desperation )  .  the director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character's emotional struggle at hand .  this is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre . 
 " mechenosets "  is one of the most beautiful romantic movies i've ever seen .  the name of the film can be translated in english as  " the sword-bearer "  .  the main hero  ( sasha )  was born with one exceptional ability :  he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand .  at first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings .  but it is not about mechenosets .  he hardly can be even called the anti-hero .  i think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good ,  justice and love .  in his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him  ( except his mother )  .  every his step is stained with blood ;  he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him .  and suddenly he meets her .  she doesn't need the idle talks and explanations .  she loves him for what he is .  she doesn't care what he did .  the fact that he's next to her is more important than anything else .  but soon she finds out his secret :  he kills two people  ( her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard )  to protect her before her very eyes .  even after that she couldn't escape her feelings .  they try to run but it's hart to hide .  finally they have a serious car accident .  he is caged ;  she is in a mental hospital .  they don't know anything about each other ,  but she believes that he'll save her .  he surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her .  they run again but they aren't invulnerable .  she is wounded ,  she needs a rest ,  but police almost catch them .  he doesn't know what to do ,  they drive into a corner ,  and then his sword begins to cut down trees ,  helicopter around them ,  but there is no need for it ,  because she is already dead in his arms ,  and he is the lonely person in the whole world again . 
i watched it subtitled as it was in russian ,  but really enjoyed it .  the main character sasha was born cursed ,  with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body .  he lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger caused him to do deadly things .    when sasha finally found love in a young woman named katya everyone tried to take her away from him ending in a deadly battle .  there was a fair amount of gore ,  but not too much for the weak stomached .   not for people who like the regular old hollywood movie ,  but for those who enjoy independent films .  kinda got the feeling of an asian fantasy film . 
i recently  ( may 2008 )  discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a dvd .  although i've seen a great deal of high quality movies since then  ( late 70's  ( i was 10 in 1978 )  )  ,  this three-episode ,  low budget thing still stands strong .   what's fun is that i now watched it with my 10 year old daughter ,  and she experiences just the same as i remember from back then :  the creepy music  ( she had to hold my hand ,  even though she's been raised with watching lotr and resident evil )  ,  the ever changing theories of who the culprit actually is ,  and also complaining about the theatrical voices from an era before norway discovered the difference between stage acting and movie acting .   this is the one and only good science fiction movie  ( or series )  ever made in norway .  and it's still worth watching . 
i remember this show from swedish television .  i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief .   i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed .   although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50 : s and the political climate of the 70 : s .  when i think of it ,  this was a real sci-fi ,  a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are .  the term sci-fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space-ships in them . 
this academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre .  told completely without dialogue ,  it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish ,  lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school ,  leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open .  after a while ,  a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around ,  comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl .  the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited .  as the cat comes very near to the bowl ,  the fish jumps out .  the cat catches the fish ,  drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy ,  not knowing what has happened ,  gets back .  this was amazingly filmed with real animals ;  how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable .  i only wish this film were available now for people to see ;  i only saw it once ,  in 1959 when it was originally released ,  but it has remained unforgettable . 
it's beyond my comprehension that so much rubbish from norway has been remastered for dvd release ,  and still gems like this don't get a shot at recapturing their past glory .  i give this a 7 ,  not because it is very good ,  but because it is one of the few scifi films made for norwegian television .  this film is nothing less than a film-historic gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first alien film .  and ,  my word ,  blindpassasjer was first !  did ridley scott or anyone in the crew see the mini-series ?  however unlikely ,  the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar .  okay ,  the budget is _much_ lower in the norwegian film ,  but given that ,  it's a really well-done piece of work from the desolate age of norwegian movie-making ,  which incidentally lasted until the 90s . 
ok .  i admit .  i'm one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved dvd player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series .  star trek  ( next generation )  was my first space date ,  and since then i've switched partners regularly .  i've seen'em all ,  it seems ,  and my favorites are «lexx» ,  «farscape» and the new «battlestar galactica» ,  in other words :  the newest ,  state of the art space operas .  but ,  i also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones ,  the cheap ones ,  like the magnificent four seasoned bbc show «blakes7» .  here ,  the budgets are smaller than hobbits ,  the special effects seem to be made on a commodore 64 ,  but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor ,  the acting dead serious and at times even high class ?   but why do they always speak english in the space future ?  because this is not the future ,  it's fantasy for kids .  still ,  it can be irritating at times .  me ,  being a norwegian ,  have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series ,  like science fiction ,  for scandinavian viewers .  i never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened .  but it did ,  actually ,  once ,  and even in my own homeland ,  norway .  i was two years old when the so called fjernsynsteatret  ( tv theater section )  of our national public service channel nrk produced this three episode version of blindpassasjer  ( the stowaway )  .   when i first heard of it ,  i was not surprised of the fact that until this day ,  the show has only been screened once in norway ,  making it impossible for me to actually see it .  it went on swedish ,  danish and finnish television also ,  in it's time ,  but that was a long time ago .  there have been no video or dvd release of it ,  not a surprise either ,  and when it was screened on an art house cinema ,  this happened in bergen ,  a city far far away from oslo  ( where i live )  .  and then there's another fact about «blindpassasjer» that didn't surprise me ,  that it was written by the two norwegian authors tor åge bringsværd and jon bing  ( bing&bringsværd )  .  this duo basically introduced the scifi genre to norwegians in the seventies ;  they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose .  in my opinion ,  bringsværd is the most interesting of the two writers ,  and has written several great and entertaining novels ,  masterpieces even ,  some of them hilarious ,  such as «bazar» and «syvsoverskens dystre frokost» .  no other than this guy ,  also an acclaimed dramatist ,  could construct the script of «blindpassasjer» .   when i finally got to watch it ,  it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on vcr in the 80's ,  eventually managed to transform it to dvd and give it to me .  he was a nice bloke .  so i sat down and watched it ,  with swedish subtitles ,  bad sound and some scrapes and errors ;  but the thing came through and i was surprised that i eventually came to love it .   the exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in blakes7 ,  and the credit goes to caprino studios  ( who made the famous flåklypa grand prix )  ,  and the interior of the marco polo  ( the space ship )  works better than i'd expected .  the acting is typically theatrical ,  but it works better than when they play ibsen ,  to put it mildly ,  and bjørn floberg carries his role solidly ,  as does trini lund .  the legendary actress henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre ,  but this is an ensemble play ,  and i'm happy to say that ola b .  johannesen carries his mustache with nobility ,  and marit østbye is a really hot space chic of my standards .   but is it really that good ?  well ,  one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending ,  the pretentious criticism of «modern society» ,  but yes ,  it's ,  well ,  not really really really fantastic ,  but charming ,  cool ,  nostalgic and pleasant .  one and a half hour of classic norwegian scifi . 
  this movie is full of references .  like  " mad max ii "  ,   " the wild one "  and many others .  the ladybug´s face it´s a clear reference  ( or tribute )  to peter lorre .  this movie is a masterpiece .  we´ll talk much more about in the future . 
to quote flik ,  that was my reaction exactly :  wow .  .  . you're perfect !  this is the best movie !  i think i can even say it's become my favorite movie ever ,  even .  wow .  i tell you what ,  wow . 
this movie is by far the cutest i have seen in a long time !  wonderful animation and adorable characters  ( even the bad guys were cute !  )  made this one a total winner in my book ,  and also in the books of those i saw it with .  i still want to see it again ,  but haven't had time .  better than toy story ,  which was good too ,  but not this good  . 
i thought this was a quiet good movie .  it was fun to watch it .  what i liked best where the 'outtakes' at the end of the movie .  they were great . 
i have to admit right off the top ,  i'm not a big fan of  " family "  films these days .  most of them ,  imho ,  are sentimental crap .  but this one ,  like toy story ,  the previous film from pixar ,  is a lot of fun .  the two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland ( especially compared to the two leads in antz ,  but otherwise this film is better )  ,  but the rest of the film more than made up for it .  the animation looked great ,  the humor ,  though broad ,  was consistently good ( i especially liked hopper's line  " if i hadn't promised mother on her deathbed that i wouldn't kill you ,  i would kill you !  "  )  ,  and the actors doing the voices ,  except the two leads ,  were all terrific ( denis leary doing an animated movie ;  what a concept )  .  and like everyone else ,  i loved the outtakes !  i hope the video has the new ones . 
this movie blew me away .  if you can see only one of the animated bug movies this year see this one instead of antz .  the plot ,  characters ,  and jokes are better in a bugs life .  also when you go stay in your seat until the end of the credits .  it's the best part of the movie .  rating 9
i was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film .  if you sit close to the screen ,  you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures .  the detail ,  colors ,  and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than toy story .  how they were able to pull off the shading ,  i will never know .  i do hope that pixar will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished .  based on this film ,  i think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film . 
sur mes lèvres or read my lips is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of 'outsiders' ,  people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to 'fit in' .  director jacques audiard with and co-writer tonino benacquista have created a tense ,  tight ,  completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights .   carla  ( emmanuelle devos )  is a plain jane ,  mostly deaf ,  thirty something unnoticed secretary for a company whose life is one of social and sexual isolation and whose view of the future is rather bleak .  enter paul  ( vincent cassel )  a recent released ex-con parolee who responds to an ad to be carla's assistant .  there is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting :  carla had hoped for a well-groomed ,  genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and paul is a coarse ,  unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk .  their concepts change rather quickly when paul salvages carla's job by filling her request to steal a letter that would cost her her job and paul discovers carla's lip reading ability which he sees as a way to spy on the criminals from his past who threaten his life for money owed .  so this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain paul's safety and freedom .  the relationship is full of twists and edge of the seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters fulfilling roles in their lives that fill the chinks in their walls of isolation in surprising ways .   devos and cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong .  once again alexandre desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer mathieu vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the hitchcockian sense of suspense .  director audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story :  he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments .  this is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the french film noir genre .  recommended .  grady harp
all of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of disney studios' last productions ,  here comes something that should heal your wounds .  .  .  once and for all ,  a bug's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake  " hand-made-old-disneys-like "  drawings  ( see the lion king ,  pocahontas ,  and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that bambi's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever )  .   a bug's life  ( 1001 pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks  !  )  succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say  " hey ,  this thing is computer generated  !  "  .  no weak parts ,  a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets ,  an astonishing 3d bird  ( close to perfection in its imitation of reality )  .  .  .  and that's only to mention the technical aspects .   the scenario ,  my friends ,  the real backbone of a motion picture ,  has some thickness  !  curiously ,  and obviously thanks to lasseter's team ,  there is practically no musical sequence in a bug's life .  which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate ,  but most others dislike  ( same thing for the parents or the anime fans ,  like me )  .  this movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring steve martin and chevy chase  :  the 3 amigos  ;  it had basically the same background story  ( a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen  ( who finally turn to be actors )  to protect them ,  etc .  .  .  )  .  simple ,  but efficient ,  and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects .   since microcosmos ,  many movies tell tales of insects ,  their lives ,  fears and hopes ,  but i do think that a bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all .  the humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved .  .  .  and the whole audience was captivated by flik's  ( aka tilt in france )  adventures .   a big thank you for lasseter's team ,  especially for the last 30 seconds .  .  .  it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs/actors forget their lines or hit the camera .  .  .   and finally ,  especially for those of you who have seen the french version ,  other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie .  a bug's life is a really good piece of entertainment ,  and i think it will soon become part of my collection of videos  ( a privilege granted to extremely few movies ,  and that's not a problem of storage room  :  )  .  go and see it ,  that's an order . 
disney  ( and the wonderful folks at pixar of course )  offer a nice ,  humourous story combined with the best of computer animation .  i admit that maybe the 'faces' of the bugs were a little more static than in 'antz' and they only had four legs  ( in 'antz' six .  .  .  )  .  but backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking .  but let this be a lesson :  it was not the computer who made it such a success  :  it was the man behind the machine ,  who added the nice little twists ,  which i missed in 'antz' .  some highlights were of course the 'bloopers' at the end  ( so keep watching at the end ,  it's worth it !  )  ,  which were highly amusing and original .  the line 'filmed entirely on location' was intended for the more attentive viewer . 
for starters ,  it's a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around that are bound to make laugh  ( check out the two russian bugs )  .   a bug's life has a classical disney storyline ,  but that's one of the good things about the movie .  family values are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution in order to stand up against the grasshoppers in the end .  and it also has a couple of great voice-overs by dave foley ,  julia-louise dreyfus ,  kevin spacey  ( of course )  ,  .  .  .  but actually ,  the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation .  it's just wonderful .  all the details ,  great colors ,  every ant looks different ,  beautiful backgrounds .  .  .  and the guys and girls at pixar made it all look so realistic .  all in all ,  a very nice piece of work .  this is the best animation by disney since aladdin . 
the animation was fab and the film funny .  the two circus bugs ,  tuck/roll were very funny .  if you waited till the credits at the end ,  you saw a very funny sequence of film ,  where they showed the bugs pretending to do things wrong like in other movies ,  that was clever as it made the characters more human and beliveable . 
a must see by all - if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one .  easily one of the best animation/cartoons released in a long-time .  it took the the movies antz to a whole new level .  do not mistake the two as being the same movie - although in principle the movies plot is similiar .  just go and enjoy . 
i liked antz ,  but loved  " a bug's life "  .  the animation that was put into this paid off .  i will definitely be getting this on dvd .  by the way ,  disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape .   ( i heard talk of squishing all of the characters into the screen on the standard video format )  .  most will have to agree that the ending credits were the funniest !  i only saw one of the two sets ,  but i can't wat to see the other one ! 
now this is what a family movie should be !  there are few films of recent years that have been targeted at families or children that really are worthy of their viewing public ;  but this is one of them .  my whole family came away from the film ,  awed ,  entertained ,  dazzled ,  and happy .  we're still quoting little anecdotes from it here and there .  the children loved it and so did we  ( hubbie and i are 36 and 32 ,  respectively )  !   apart from its beautiful and striking animation ,  the characters  ( small as they may be ,  and imaginary as they are )  are very well developed .  there isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with .  the personalities bringing these little creatures to life are well casted voice talents ,  combined with the skill and artistry of some of disney's best animators .  this is a film worthy of walt disney ,  himself .  i think mr .  disney would heartily approve of this new film .  .  .  flick ,  dot and their fellow band of tiny heroes may become as popular as mickey and minnie in our time .   this is one the family leaves the theatre wanting to see again .  .  and buy to own on video or dvd .  i'm eager to see it again .  .  to pick up what i might have missed the first time .   ( never have i seen my children so quickly and vividly identify with and embrace characters before .  .  .  my daughter is still talking about little  " dot "  .  )   this film is funny ,  heartwarming ,  clever and great fun for the whole family ! 
bugs life is a good film .  but to me ,  it doesn't really compare to movies like toy story and stuff .  don't get me wrong ,  i liked this movie ,  but it wasn't as good as toy story .  the film has the visuals ,  the laughs ,  and others that toy story had .  but the film didn't feel quite as .  .  .  i don't know ,  but i thought it was still a pretty good film .    a bugs life .  .  .  i don't want to say this ,  is a film that i don't remember .  i saw it years ago .  of course ,  i haven't seen toy story in years ,  but i still remember it .  i shouldn't have reviewed this film ,  but i am .  i am giving it a thumbs up ,  though it's not exactly the best work pixar has done .   a bug's life : ***/****
pixar has had massive success over the years with the full-length cgi animated movies they have made .   " a bug's life "  was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far ,  preceded by the company's feature-length debut ,  the groundbreaking  " toy story "  ,  which was the first ever feature-length cgi movie .  i remember when this follow-up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990's ,  but i never actually saw it until november 2006 .  i watched it twice that month ,  and over three years later ,  i have seen it a third time .  it has never impressed me as much as probably any other pixar film i've ever seen ,  but after three viewings ,  i still think it's better than some of the films i've seen from dreamworks animation .   ant island is the home of a colony of ants .  these ants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year .  one member of this colony is flik ,  an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his inventions ,  even though he doesn't mean to .  one year ,  when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering ,  flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it !  the grasshopper leader ,  hopper ,  decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season ,  but they will have to double their offering !  flik suggests to the colony's royal council that he goes and finds  " warrior bugs "  to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back .  princess atta ,  the future queen ,  lets him go on this mission just so he won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering .  the inventor finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors ,  but after he takes them back to ant island and introduces them ,  he learns that they are actually not warriors ,  but circus bugs !   the main reason why this second pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters .  to me ,  none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have ,  and generally seem a bit bland .  fortunately ,  however ,  it's not like  " shark tale "  ,  a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character .   " a bug's life "  does have a likable enough main character ,  one which viewers can root for .  the story also seems somewhat bland at times ,  but for the most part ,  it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining ,  and sometimes has some good suspense ,  especially later on .  the humour ,  like certain other aspects of the film ,  isn't as good as it could have been ,  but there are definitely funny moments ,  some of them involving francis ,  a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female .  you can always expect great animation from pixar ,  and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception .  with all this movie has to offer ,  it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to pixar standards ,  but it is reasonable family entertainment . 
a bug's life is a very good animated feature .  this movie is for younger children ,  but it is also a great movie for people my age .  the story is about an ant named flik .  he brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers .  he gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess .  this movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a pixar movie .  the animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's .  the story is good ,  but a little more detail would be suffice .  the voice acting is good as with most animation movies .  the music is nice to listen to .  nothing special ,  but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories .  overall ,  this movie struck me as awestruck .  this is a good movie for all families .  i rate this movie 10/10 . 
carla works for a property developer's where she excels in being unattractive ,  unappreciated and desperate .  she is also deaf .   her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company .  help arrives in the form of paul ,  a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment .   an implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week .  when carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits paul's criminality by having him steal the contract back .  the colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery ,  but when he confronts her ,  paul's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price .    paul is given a 'going over' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt .  he formulates a plan which utilises carla's unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers .  it's now carla's turn to enter a frightening new world .   the fourth feature from director jacques audiard ,  'read my lips' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners .  the leads are excellent ;  effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect .  carla's first meeting with paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was ,  until very recently ,  a jailbird .  emmanuelle devos ,  who plays carla ,  has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame .  vincent cassel plays paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed .   like many french films ,  'read my lips' appears ,  at first ,  to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything .  the only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of paul's parole officer ;  a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac .   it was the french 'new wave' of the 60's that first introduced the concept of 'genre' to film making and i've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it ;  so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre ,  or better still ,  defy it . 
many of the american people would say .  .  . what ?  ?  ?  to my opening comment .  yes i know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the master akira kurosawa ,  but if you analyze this movie ,  my comment is right .  we have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village .  the great difference is the way that the story takes .  our samurais ,  a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs ,  heroes .  please watch again this incredible movie  ( the seven samurai ,  obviously )  and find another movies who has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the masterpiece of akira kurosawa .  a tip is the 13th warrior with antonio banderas ,  michael crichton copied the story to wrote his best seller's ,  but he didn't found the third foot of the cat . 
when watching a bug's life for the first time in a long while ,  i couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's happy feet .  as far as the main storyline goes ,  they are very similar ,  an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special .  it just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion .  a lot of people disagree with me when i say that i really like pixar's sophomore effort .  sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of toy story ,  nor is the animation out of this world .  however ,  the story is top-notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with .  with plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot ,  i could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics .   there is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here .  between our lead flick needing to keep his self-esteem up to save his colony ,  the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future ,  and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks ,  everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story .  even the villain hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons .  he is not doing it to be mean ,  but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1 .  he needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth .  it is very much a circle of life ,  but not one that can't evolve with the ages .   when thinking about the animation ,  it is actually quite good .  compared to antz ,  the rival film of the time ,  this is much more realistic and less cartoony .  the water is rendered nicely ,  as is the foliage .  you don't have to look much further than the ants' eyes to see how much detail went into the production .  the reflections and moistness ,  despite the smooth exterior ,  shows the realism .  all the bugs are finely crafted too .  the flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on ,  whether for a small role or a more expanded one .  it is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments .  while ant island is nice ,  it is just the outdoors .  bug city contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs .  it is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything .  from the ice cube trays as circus stands ,  the animal crackers box as circus wagoncomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideand crazy compilation of boxes to create a times square of billboards and facades ,  everything is done right .   as far as much of the humor ,  you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices .  no one could do a male ladybug better than dennis leary with his acerbic wit .  i dare you to think of someone better .  our leads are great too with dave foley as flick and julia louis-dreyfus as princess atta ,  as well as the always-fantastic kevin spacey as hopper .  spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie ,  but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits .  yes ,  a bug's life was the originator of animated outtakes from pixar ,  a tradition that has continued on .  with many tongue-in-cheek bug jokes laced throughout ,  you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast .  full of  " those guy actors ,  "  it is people like richard kind ,  brad garrett ,  and the late joe ranft as heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs .   overall ,  it may be the simplest story brought to screen by pixar ,  one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years ,  but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience .  there are joyous moments ,  sad times ,  and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun .  complete with a couple of my favorite pixar characters ,  tuck and roll ,  there isn't too much bad that i can think of saying about it . 
lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson's early bean performances ,  and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work ,  something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages ,  in a way that just makes you feel good .  a bug's life has that same charm ,  it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects ,  because even though they talk ,  they still act just like real bugs .  it's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them ,  to imagine bugs the way a young mind does .   honey ,  i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger ,  and to me ,  a bug's life is like a more realistic version of that movie ,  if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story-telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities .  i try not to compare it to something like toy story  ( which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made )  ,  because the story of a bug's life is not quite as good as toy story's ,  but then again ,  almost nothing is .  the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun .    the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society ,  mostly geared around building a harvest of food ,  most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers ,  vastly superior in strength and general meanness ,  and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter .  we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers ,  who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food ,  the consequences will be dire .  and incidentally ,  the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tse-tung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the  " great leap forward "   the fun and excitement begins when flik ,  the main character ,  sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers .  you see ,  he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger ,  so he feels it's his responsibility ,  but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers .  great for the audience ,  not so great for the safety of the clan .    the movie was released back in the late 90s ,  when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos ,  like armageddon and deep impact ,  independence day and the arrival ,  a bug's life and antz ,  etc .  comparisons between a bug's life and antz are inevitable ,  although it seems clear to me that a bug's life is by far the superior film ,  and not only because it doesn't star woody allen stuttering and whining through the lead role .  this is great family fun ! 
when i bought my toy story tape when it came out to video after being released in theaters i saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of toy story .  as soon as i saw that i knew this was gonna be a good feature !  i was right !  a bug's life like toy story is great story ,  great characters and great animation .  my favorite characters are dim the rhino beetle voiced by brad garrett and hemlich the caterpillar voiced by the late pixar storyman joe ranft .  my favorite scene is when slim the walking stick  ( david hyde pierce )  lifts up hemlich trying to distract the bird and hemlich's like you hoo mr .  early bird .  how about a nice tasting worm on a stick and slim's like i'm going to snap !  i'm going to snap !  i just died laughing at that scene .  being a big fan of insects i think a bug's life is my favorite pixar even though i know a lot of people consider it the worst pixar film ever !  i don't know how you could hate a pixar film !  i think they're all pretty good films !  good job pixar ! 
the movie was totally awesome and cool .  the graphics was superb and it was amazing ,  especially ,  flik was superb and awesome in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent .  the circus bugs are colorful and they are superb in the movie .  the grasshoppers were also superb and cool in the movie .  hopper was a pure and perfect villain .  even ,  dot was cute .  when ,  the bird comes to eat the bugs ,  that scene was superb and good .  even ,  the last scene was awesome and cool .  even ,  flik's inventions was good .  building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the grasshoppers .  when ,  the ants are building the artificial bird ,  that scene was good and nice i should really appreciate the creators of  " a bug's life "  . 
such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar's a bug's life ;  we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film ,  but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation .  for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when it's in the right hands that is  a bug's life is a warm reminder .  we walk out of the film with an equally-warm feeling ,  and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high-calibre film productions .   it is only pixar's second animated feature .  the sub-group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995 ,  with their landmark movie toy story .  it was a movie which defied convention ,  re-invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence .  now ,  they return with their sophomore effort which ,  to be honest ,  draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film .   after all ,  it's a film about ants .  well ,  all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug's life ,  but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film ,  as humans are the focal point in dramas ,  romances and so on .  how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie ,  let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film ?  surely they jest .  however ,  we forget that in toy story ,  a bunch of toy-box items were able to become the grandest ,  most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted .  the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat ,  and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you'll probably ever encounter .   not only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there isn't an unpleasant character in sight ;  even the villains are riveting characters  but they're colourful ,  they're eclectic ,  and they're idiosyncratic .  and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term ,  only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug's life from the beginning .  we shall start with our main character ,  and our hero .  his name is flik  ( david foley )  ,  and his character is rather generic to say the least .  out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush ,  beautiful ant island ,  he is the one considered the 'black sheep' of the clan ,  as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season's harvest with his antics .   the problem arises in the fact that the ants' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper  ( kevin spacey )  ,  who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants ;  when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone ,  they go insane ,  for lack of a better term .  hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack's hands ;  however ,  it's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil .  the cogs and clockwork in flik's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame ,  and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony's rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers .   if you think about it ,  a bug's life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line's of akira kurosawa's classic seven samurai ,  or the american remake the magnificent seven ,  in which a village of hapless but good-hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone village-dweller goes in search for help in the big city ,  finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil .  in a bug's life ,  the help comes in the form of a down-and-out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar-room brawl .   much amusement comes out of these scenes ,  and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs .  among them are an erudite stick insect  ( david hyde pierce )  ,  a side-splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi-femme fatale ladybug who's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug  ( dennis hopper )  .  it's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on-screen ,  as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on-screen ,  as is the entire movie collectively .   as i've said ,  much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another ,  which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines ,  wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie .  what makes a bug's life even better is that the film isn't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be ,  although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kid-friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we'd like .  however ,  it's easy to ignore this fault ,  and it's incredulously easy to enjoy this film .   although a bug's life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor ,  this is still a superb movie ,  and the start of something promising here .  pixar have proved that they're not just a one-hit wonder ,  but instead a much-gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood .  they raise the bar endlessly ,  and when someone always manages to top their standards ,  it's only always by themselves .  what more is there to say about a bug's life other than :  see it ;  it's not quite the best which we've seen from the folks at emeryville ,  california ,  but this beats out the lot of its year  and i'll be damned if this isn't the best animated feature of 1998 .   8 . 5/10
you will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation ,  and the novelty probably won't wear off on the first ,  second or third viewing ,  but you ? ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing ,  that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way ,  which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium .   disney continues to firmly hold the title of  " greatest animation in the world "  ,  with  " a bug ? s life "  standing as one of their greatest achievements .  one of the innovative attachments being the delightful  " out-takes "  added to the end of the film .  the dvd has two sets of these out-takes where as i ? m told the vhs cassette has one alternating version per tape .  the dvd also features  " gerry ? s game "  which is a delightful little pixar short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters .   this is by far the superior insect-film in comparison to dreamworks ?   " antz "  ,  which in all fairness is pretty good ,  but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters .  if you look at the star voices of both films ,   " antz "  is largely cast with big name  " movie "  stars with a few familiar  " tv "  star voices ,  where  " a bug ? s life "  is just the opposite ,  loaded with  " tv "  stars with kevin spacey as the only stand out exception .  but the difference in quality is distinct and obvious .   dreamworks can ? t be blamed or surprised though ,  when you go head to head with disney ,  you have your work cut out for you .  this is the kind of film that almost makes me wish i had children to share it with .  don ? t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids ,  though . 
critically ,  people say that antz is better .  antz is a good film ,  but i enjoyed bug's life a bit more .  i can't remember a pixar animation ,  other than the two toy story films ,  that i was laughing so hard .  the animation is clean ,  the story is original and doesn't preach .  the voice overs are what make this movie .  dave foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot .  hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful kevin spacey ,  as is haydn panettiere as dot  .  there is also sterling support from dennis leary ,  david hyde pierce and madeline kahn ,  and i could go on and on .  the script is fantastic ,  so funny and sometimes even touching .  it lacks the social messages of antz ,  but what we have is rock-solid entertainment .  9/10 .  bethany cox
a bugs life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too .  the story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food  (  a mirror of the magnifiscent seven )  .  there is some wonderfull computer animation and the voices are great too .  you will love it !  !  8 out of 10
i watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it .  i loved it .  a very good ,  tight plot ,  an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly ,  fat ,  deaf girl and the ex-con ,  and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried .    a much ,  much better film than the same director's de battre mon coeur s'est arreté ,  which was boring and unbelievable .   the only thing that didn't quite work was that the supposedly ugly ,  fat girl was neither ugly nor fat :  solid ,  certainly ,  and far from conventionally beautiful ,  but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it .  superb .  i wish she was in more films ,  and better ones than she generally is .  i've seen a bit of gilles' wife and a bit of the moustache ,  and they both looked like rubbish ,  and i've seen all of de battre mon coeur s'est arreté ,  and that certainly is rubbish .  she seems to have a few coming up ,  so i'll keep my fingers crossed . 
this is a funny film .  it has all the usual disney components  ( music ,  great range of characters ,  story ,  appeal )  ,  entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say  " antz "  and  " price of egypt "  .   the characters work really well ,  and have a strong appeal ,  and the humour is aimed at a wide level which overcomes generational barriers .  the movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format ,  which adds to the cinema experience .   call me crazy ,  but i have seen the film three times ,  and i intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend .  many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed .  i work in a multiplex ,  and i can honestly say that no-one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction .   see it ,  and don't be put off because it is animated .  you are sure to enjoy this movie ,  and make sure you stay for the end credits !  the bloopers and out-takes at the end are the funniest part of the film ,  which is packed with laughs throughout . 
there is great detail in a bug's life .  everything is covered .  the film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping .  the film isn't too terribly orignal ,  it's basically a modern take on kurosawa's seven samurai ,  only with bugs .  i enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad .  it seems that disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut-outs .  the grasshoppers are menacing and hopper ,  the lead bad guy ,  was a brillant creation .  check this one out . 
 " a bug's life "  is like a favorite candy bar -- it's chock-full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty .   the story couldn't have been better ;  it's clever ,  has  " heart "   ( emotion )  ,  and every character has a nice  " arc "   ( a growth or change )  .  by comparison ,  the only characters in  " toy story "  to have an  " arc "  are buzz ,  who learns to love being a toy ,  and woody ,  who overcomes his resentment of buzz .  there are tons of laughs and cute moments in  " a bug's life "  .  all of the actors turn in great voice work ,  and the animation ,  both the motion and detail ,  is superb .   this serious movie buff doesn't throw around  " 10 " s lightly ,  but this movie certainly deserves the  " 10 "  i gave it . 
 ( originally a response to a movie reviewer who said a bug's life was too much ,  too fast--he was  " dazed and exhausted "  by the visuals ,  and seemed to ignore the story completely )   okay ,  first off ,  i'm 26 years old ,  have a job ,  go to school ,  and have a fiance' .  so maybe i'm nuts and just really good at hiding it .  .  . but not only did i not come away from a bug's life exhausted or dazed ,  it wasn't until i saw it the second time that i could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time i went to see this movie ,  i got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that i forgot that i was supposed to be sitting there being  " wowed "  by each frame visually .  how can you not empathize with flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life ?   " heck "  indeed ,  i found myself identifying with that little ant  ( not to mention some of the other bugs )  in a lot more ways than one .  .  . and that ,  in itself ,  says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy .  of course ,  it's beautiful  ( every blade of grass ,  the tree ,  the rain .  .  .  )  .  of course ,  what they can do with technology is amazing  ( you can read their lips !  try it !  )  .  but this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech ,  not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color .  no ,  a bug's life would be static if it were all that and no story .  but ,  i'm glad to say ,  it's not !  a bug's life has real heart .  yes ,  there's a lot going on ,  storyline-wise as well as visually ,  but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them !  just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think !  besides that ,  i think that the pixar crew made this for themselves ,  even before their kids .  .  . and it shows ,  in the amount of heart in has .  this movie is moving ,  touching ,  funny ,  intriguing ,  and generally engrossing .  the character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing ,  there's a major amount of character growth ,  and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general .  it doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene ,  every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there ,  and there are no gratuitous shots .  not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety ,  to me ,  folks ;  it means not  " dumbing down "  your movie and assuming the audience is stupid ,  which it mostly is not .  all i can think is ,  if you can see a bug's life and not feel anything at all ,  then you must have never made a big mistake ,  hurt your friends ,  had a crush ,  fallen in love ,  been frustrated that no one would listen to you ,  lied to someone you care about ,  felt like a social misfit ,  gotten excited over a new idea ,  come up with a great idea ,  had what you thought was a great idea backfire ,  been awkward one moment and confident the next ,  felt the pressure of responsibility ,  stood up for yourself and your loved ones ,  stood alone against the crowd ,  felt like a failure ,  felt like a big success ,  felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others .  .  . well ,  you get the point .  final words :  a+ rating from me ;  please ,  if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre  ( pan and scan video is not going to work for this movie )  ;  if you loved toy story you'll most likely love this  ( pixar knows how to make movies with heart )  ;  if you do love it see it multiple times or you still won't know what you're missing  ( the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable )  ;  and whenever you're feeling really low ,  just pretend it's a seed ,  okay ? 
a good film with strong performances  ( especially the two leads )  .  the film is about two american girls who are caught with 6 kilo's heroin on an airport in thailand .  they're both thrown in prison and one of them signs a confession .  bill pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get them out .  all they have to do is find a nick parks who put the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls .  so far for the story which isn't that original  ( it has many resemblances with the better return to paradise )  .   the acting and newton thomas sigel's beautiful photography make this film worth to watch .  a 7 out of 10 . 
this is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots .  the philippines substitute for thailand and nobody actually goes to hong kong .  the stock shot of a cathay pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfectly .  this film proves that you need neither mega budgets nor a headliner star to produce an excellent movie .  it contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into .  solid workmanship from people who know all the aspects of movie making and who understand the compromises between art and box office .  an excellent piece of work ! 
after high-school graduation ,  best friends alice and darlene ,  decide to take a trip to thailand .  whilst they are there ,  they meet a charming australian guy named nick .  after spending some time with nick ,  he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to hong kong with him .  they agree .  at the airport though ,  they are get busted for smuggling drugs and then get convicted for 33 years in a thai prison for something they say they haven't done .  not really knowing what to do they end contacting yankee hank ,  an american lawyer who lives in thailand with his wife .  word has it that if you have the money he can help you .  things start of well ,  but they still can't get out .   the movie is really good because it doesn't let on what's going to happen and it's interesting all the time .  i couldn't believe the ending though .  it was one of those endings where you don't know the 100% truth ,  but you still kind of know what really happened with nick and the drug smuggling because of the 'owning up' etc .    claire danes and kate beckinsale both give quite good performances here .  beckinsales performance was a little weak though .  both danes and beckinsales characters friendship is good but could of seemed stronger .  paul walker even has a small uncredited role here .   ;  )   anyway ,  i thought brokedown palace was a good movie and i give it a 7/10 . 
good exciting movie ,  although it looks to me that it's not been recorded on location in thailand ,  it still looks realistic .  nice story about some girls having 'fun' in one of the most beautiful countries on the world .  in real the thai people are very kind . 
*possible spoilers* although done before  ( and better )  in 'midnight express' and 'return to paradise' ,  brokedown palace still strikes a chord with me .   here we have the tale of two young girls who travel through thailand ,  and get arrested on charges of trafficking drugs .  was it clare danes' alice ?  was it kate beckinsale's darlene ?  was it the handsome stranger whom they met on their journey ?  none of that really matters ,  for this is a tale of friendship and trust and the limits they can be stretched to .  throw in bill pullman as an unenthusiastic lawyer and jacqueline kim as his thai bride  ( and better lawyer than he is )  and we have a nice little story that holds the audience's attention .   brokedown palace is nothing extraordinary ,  or notorious for any reason - it is not an original concept ,  it doesn't show sensationalised violence that leads to the wannabe-avant-garde crowd talking about it's  " gritty realism "  or  " hard hitting truths "  - it is merely a good story with some fine performances .  bill pullman is weakest with his lazy drawl and gravelly way of talking - i was quite bored with the character .   kate beckinsale ,  while decent ,  is nothing spectacular .  she acts well ,  but it's not exactly a memorable performance .   jacqueline kim however ,  is in fine form ,  crafting a likable and defined character where ,  really ,  there is not much to work with .   but make no mistake - this is clare danes' movie .  i've long been a fan of her work ,  and this is no change .  she captivates in every scene she appears ,  and were it not for her ,  the film would probably stoop into boring fare .  i particularly applaud her performance in the scene between her and darlene's father .   the film also has a brilliant soundtrack .   7 out of 10
i think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie !  or damn australian ?  i still don't know ,  but what i know is that i really liked this movie but that couldn't be my favorite movie !   great story with great actors but with a terrible end .  .  .  to make you cry and say 'oh ,  she's so good' .  .  .  still ,  who made it ?  what really happened ?  who's that guy ?  no answer to these questions .  .  .   mysterious movie with a good mark overall .  .  .  i give it a 8/10 ,  going on the 8 . 5 ! 
i loved the movie ,  but like everyone said ,  there were some bits that weren't developed enough .  i thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison ;  sure ,  they were supposed to be innocent american girls but still .  .  . i felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have .  for example ,  in the montage where they're sight-seeing ,  the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward-looking .   then ,  there are some parts that were very ambiguous .  i think it's pretty much understood that danes' character didn't do it ,  but i can see how that could be confusing .  also ,  why did the camera dwell on manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk ?  i thought it was suggesting something ,  but it turned out to be nothing .   apart from that ,  the movie was great .  i cried when claire danes took the blame ;  she's a great actress .   also ,  i wanted to see that bitchy thai inmate get her ass kicked .  talk about lack of closure .  .  . 
this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters .  i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover  ( let alone reviews )  and was intrigued for two solid hours .  two lost ships from two different worlds collide .  the sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact .  toward the end i couldn't decide which i wanted more :  our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion .  rml could've done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plenty .  i'm nitpicking though .  after a series of netflix ,  blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making . 
brokedown palace is the story of two best friends ,  alice and darlene ,  who go on a spontaneous trip to thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage .  in this way ,  the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film ,  such as  " return to paradise "  ,  but instead ,  the movie chose to focus little on the girls' situation and more on their friendship .   claire danes and kate beckinsale both turn in excellent performances ,  and the movie is much more about the interplay between them - the suspicion ,  the jealousy ,  the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship .  this movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life  ( which is a bit glossed over )  ,  and focuses more on these friendship issues .   there were some plot holes here ,  and some parts that just didn't seem believable or realistic .  we didn't feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have .  and we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls ,  with bill pullman playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold .  in short ,  this should ,  by all rights ,  have been a much darker movie than it was .   but overall ,  i enjoyed it .  the acting was good ,  the soundtrack was perfect ,  and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting .  worth seeing . 
well ,  what can i say having just watched this fantastic film ,  when my nerves are still jangling !  jacques audiard the director must be making quite a name for himself in france ,  and rightly so .  vince cassel is no tom cruise and emmanuelle devos is no penelope cruz either ,  but these two are fantastic actors ,  and this is a taut and compelling thriller which starts off slowly with some clever character building and then starts to put tension on tension to a wonderful climax .  others have written about the plot ,  so i will not say more than everyone in this film plays their role to perfection ,  the director ,  the actors ,  right down to the cameraman ,  and everything seems so real ,  no stupid gun play ,  the fighting when it happens is so credible ,  the expressions ,  the emotions ,  it is almost as you are there as a spectator .  do yourself a favour ,  get the dvd ,  a bottle of wine ,  turn the lights low ,  take the phone off the hook and immerse yourself in this hitchcockian thriller  :  ) 
two adventurous teenagers ,  best friends ,  take a trip to thailand for one last experience before separating and going off to college .  it seems like a fun time of touring an exotic land ,  until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them into taking a trip to hong kong and puts drugs in their luggage .  they get nabbed by the local police and find that justice in asia is very different from justice in the u . s .   this is the main story line for  " brokedown palace "  and it was a good one .  the film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world nations .  actually ,  the portrayal was rather mild ,  as the prison conditions are often far worse than depicted .  it serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is ,  it is pristine by comparison to much of the rest of the world .   unfortunately ,  there were too many contrived situations in the film that hampered the story .  the whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy .  to think that friends would be able to smuggle money for a bribe into the prison in a padded bra ,  and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking everything brought in from visitors ,  assumes that either the guards or the viewers are utter blockheads .   the story also fails to bring closure to the nagging question of how the drugs got in alice's  ( claire danes )  backpack .  did she actually agree to transport the drugs ?  we are left to guess .  it was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls' innocence throughout the film ,  but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or both of the girls might be guilty .  except for this considerable flaw ,  the ending was excellent and the results unexpected .   the acting by claire danes and kate beckinsale was very solid and well done .  danes ,  who has been oversold and over hyped ,  actually arrived as an actor in this film .  though her portrayal was frequently immature  ( as was her character )  ,  she improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more dire .  beckinsale ,  in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief career and shines as the goody-two-shoes who suddenly finds herself in prison .  her's was the best performance in the film .   bill pullman was miscast as the lawyer .  his wry and diffident style is an asset in films like  " while you were sleeping "  ,  but as a lawyer in a third world country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice ,  he had the wrong personality .   the tourist's look at thailand was interesting ,  but it didn't make me want to go there .   overall ,  an entertaining film made implausible in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes .  i gave it a 7/10 . 
i have been waiting for such an original picture such as this for quite some time now .  brokedown palace has that `hard to believe' aspect ,  however with the ingenious directing ,  and screenplay ,  palace scores big .     i've really never enjoyed watching claire danes in any of her movies ,  but i'll tell you what ,  she really changed my mind with this one .  kate beckinsale joins danes on a vacation to thailand where they meet up with a young man who convinces them to take a trip to hong kong with him .  however ,  he neglected to inform them that they would be carrying an obscene amount of narcotics for him .  well ,  ultimately they get caught ,  and end up in a thailand prison .  i know ,  i know ,  how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs ?  well if you can get by that one tiny miscue ,  you will find a very well written ,  and acted out story .  lately i have found myself getting drawn into the storylines of the movies i watch ,  and developing a personal feeling for the characters that i watch .  this movie is no different .  by the end of the movie i found myself caring more for her than any of the other characters in the film .     bill pullman plays hank green ,  an attorney who lives in thailand and specializes in international relations .  as always pullman delivers with an excellent performance and ties the movie together beautifully .     there are a few twists and turns that will ,  by the end of the movie ,  have you in tears .  this is one of those movies that you have most likely passed by when searching for that movie to watch at home .  it is my opinion that the next time out at the video store ,  do not pass by this one again . 
i saw this movie in the theater ,  and was thoroughly impressed by it .  then again ,  that was when claire danes was a good actress ,  not the foolish ,  arrogant ,  hollywood-ized bitch she is today .  anyway ,  this film really struck me as one of the more raw ,  realistic ,  beautiful friendship films .  how far would you really go for your best friend ?  i was moved to tears at the end ,  and still tear up when i watch it now  ( i own it )  .  i remember as soon as i left the theater ,  i called my best friend and sobbed to her how much i loved her .  this is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend .  however be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you'd do something like that for her .  .  .  . 
i watched this movie 11 years ago in company with my best female friend .  i got my judgment teeth pulled out so i didn't feel very good .   i ended up liking it big time .  it's a hard watch if you take in account that it deals with friendship ,  unwanted betrayal ,  power ,  money ,  drug traffic ,  and the extreme hard situation that deals with living in a foreign jail .   the acting is on it's prime level .  two of the women that i lust the most star and that's a good thing .  claire danes is as cute and charming as always while kate beckinsale is extremely hot and delivers a fine performance .  bill pullman is also great and demonstrates his histrionic qualities .   there are many plot twists to dig from and make it an interesting visual experience .  plus it shows the difficult times at thailand .   this is an underrated movie .  not many films like this one have come up in recent history .  it should make you reflex about many things .  .  . 
while i do not think this was a perfect 10 ,  i do agree it was way above a 6 which is what it's rated here .  no ,  brokedown palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before .  that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done again if it is done well and i think this movie had some strong moments .  the acting of claire danes ,  as already mentioned many times ,  was flawless as was kate beckinsell and i think bill pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances ( pullman's wife ,  the crooked cop ,  skip or trip or whatever his name is )  .  the cinematography was also beautifully filmed ,  there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some negatives ( three major ones that i found )  as well .   here is what i didn't like about it-the friendship between the girls-in fact ,  the girls' own individual personalities-were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic .  it would not have been improbable to lose interest before then ,  because ,  despite the positives ,  more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested ,  were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much jumping around without the character and scene development i think would have been appropriate for this type of film .  that ,  however ,  is not my major problem .  and warning-spoiler alert .   the ending as mentioned dozens of times already ,  was awful .  it was awful in two respects .  firstly ,  even though it would have been predictable and very hollywood ,  i wanted a happy ending !  yes ,  it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this ,  there is a sense that justice will be served and i did sit through it to see that .  i was genuinely shocked at the ending and it was performed with excellence by all involved but i feel both girls should have got out or ,  barring that ,  at least the cop should have got what was coming to him .  i mean nothing happens to the bad guys ,  they all get away with it .  very disturbing .   also ,  i do not understand the ambiguity of the ending .  i understand endings that are inspired to make one think ,  but this was not a mystery or  " clue "  type movie we were watching ,  and i would have liked to know something about what actually happened , who was guilty etc ,  with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since i somehow doubt there will be a sequel ,  i did not want to be kept guessing .   still ,  there was a lot to like about this movie ,  and the acting is definitely at the top of the list , i would rate this a 7 . 5 and say it is definitely worth a look . 
i caught this movie by accident on cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it's entirety and i'm glad i did .  i was immediately drawn by the storyline and cared about the girls involved .  naive high school graduates ,  best friends since childhood ,  take a high school trip and are taken in by a con man named nick who get them into serious trouble .  they are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring .  taken in to custody the girls learn to cope with their incarceration while trying to find a way out of their trouble .  everything that they try to help themselves falls short when the thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the trust of their american lawyer  " yankee hank "  .  hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by alice ( claire dane )  .  however ,  the thai native wife of hank smells a rat in the case and does some further foot work of investigation and finds out the girls really were victimized .  the end of the movie when alice does a selfless act to save darlene  ( beckinsale )  had me in tears .  i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it . 
i like films that don't provide the typical  " happy ending ,  "  and that's my main reason for my liking of this movie .  alice marano  ( danes )  and her best friend darlene  ( beckinsale )  are arrested in thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the thai authorities .  the film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether  ( or which )  of the girls was involved ,  and bill pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer .  jacqueline kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind ,  magnanimous wife ,  yon ,  who is also an attorney .  i wish the girls had been abused more in the prison ,  as another commenter has suggested ,  as i've heard that thai prisons can be quite brutal .  where this film grabs me ,  however ,  is its ending .  alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that darlene can be pardoned ,  and we  ( the viewers )  realize that they are both innocent .  any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me ,  and this well-acted drama is certainly deserving . 
in the film  " brokedown palace ,  "  directed by jonathan kaplan ,  two best friends ,  alice  ( claire danes )  and darlene  ( kate beckinsale )  decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to hawaii ,  but hear that bangkok ,  thailand ,  is much more fun .  they switched plans and decided to go to thailand without telling their parents the change of plans .  while they were in thailand ,  alice and darlene met a really handsome guy named nick parks  ( daniel lapaine )  .  he tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to hong kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in hong kong .  they accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs .  they were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison .    i think kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever .  also ,  a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face .  those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever .  things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made .  sometimes life is not fair ,  that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made .   this movie has a great setting ;  it was filmed mostly in bangkok thailand .  this film also has great music ;  a few of my favorite songs are 'silence' by delerium ,  'damaged' by plumb ,  'deliver me' by sarah bightman and 'party's just begun' by nelly furtado .  i went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film .  these girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly ,  a mistake that anyone could make ,  therefore this film is good for any audience .  it makes no difference young or old -- we all are human and subject to mistakes .  even though ,  i did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of --who really smuggled the drugs ?  -- i would definitely give this film two thumbs up . 
we all have friends .  some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with ,  people that you can say are like your brother or sister .  alice  (  danes  ) and darlene  (  beckinsale  )  are like that .  you can see that from the beginning .  they graduated together ,  they go to parties together and they decide to go to bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to hawaii .  they also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster .  the rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope .  it also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone .   brokedown palace is a very good film ,  it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that i want to talk about .  but first i want to say what is good about the film .  and for starters the acting is top notch ,  and you can look no further than the two leads .  danes and beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have .  alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges ,  but she seems more fun than darlene .  but sometimes that fun can get her into trouble .  darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes ,  it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of alice's .  bill pullman is adequate as the american lawyer living in thailand .  the film is photographed very well also .  the inside of the prison while not the same as shawshank or natural born killers or return to paradice ,  but it does show the necessary  (  but underdone )  hopelessness of the situation that they are in .  johnathin kaplan's direction is quite good as well .  we see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day .  brokedown palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive .  the other thing that i had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film .  it heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection .  the song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison .  you can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life .  and it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do .  we have it easy compared to some country's and believe it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject .  some of the music is done by a group called delirium  (  i think  )  but it is sara mclaughlin (  wrong spelling ,  but how do you spell her last name ?   )  that does the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and it adds so much to the film .   what i didn't enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girls exhibit .  i won't say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself you'll know what i am talking about .  also i didn't really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad .  it looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that invlove men doing time in a foreign country ,  the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic .  but i didn't get that here .   overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question ,   "  how far would you go for a friend ?   "  that is a tough question and maybe one that none of us could honestly answer until put into the same situation .  let's just hope that it never comes down to that . 
it's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily just like almost every other american movie ,  and then be surprised when that doesn't happen .  i like a happy ending as much as the next guy ,  but sometimes it's better to portray things in a more realistic manner ,  and i thought brokedown palace did this very well .   the ending ,  with one friend basically sacrificing herself for the other ,  thus redeeming her earlier poor behavior which got them into the situation in the first place ,  was very moving .  i almost rather would have done without the last line ,  which proved that she didn't actually do the deed she confessed to ,  because that would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls ,  and less about the crime .  whether she did it or not wasn't that important .   the story itself bordered on the cliché ,  but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances .  very realistic ,  very captivating .   7 out of 10 . 
i love claire danes ,  and kate beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role .  the movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some monastery ,  working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial-arts-like discipline .  the acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed-to-be thailand is eye-catching ,  but claire daines steals the entire movie ,  and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end ,  in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world .  the flaws are minute and i recommend the film ,  which seems buried sadly forever to rare tv showings .  i for one want the film for my collection- a collection of only  " 10 "  rated films .  watch it ,  you will be very touched . 
 " what would you do ?  "  is a question that will stick in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional brokedown palace .  you will also be left wondering if alice  ( danes )  was telling the truth or not - a issue that is left unresolved ,  and rightly so .  this is a particularly well acted and beautifully shot film .  although it is slow at times ,  its pace is reflective of the story line - but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat ;  wanting to know what happens next .  the ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the lead characters ,  which are brilliantly played by kate beckinsale and claire danes .  bill pullman's performance is commendable ,  too . 
this movie is cold ,  bare truth .  often we think  " oh no ,  that won't happen to me .  "  but it can .  drug smuggling is big money and often people are unknowingly  ( or tricked )  into doing things for smugglers .  the story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them ,  only wanted a exotic holiday - which turned into a nightmare .  people need to know that these sort of events aren't improbable or exaggerated - this is a major problem in today's society .   i would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie .  it is very emotional and raw .  well worth watching and certainly stays in your memory . 
alice ( claire danes )  and darlene ( kate beckinsale )  have been best friends since forever and after they graduate they decide to take a trip to thailand .  due to a incident ,  they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him hong kong for the weekend .  but at the airport ,  alice and darlene are mistaken for drug smuggling heroine and they are sent to prison .  now it's time for ultimate survival and true friendship .  this was a pretty good movie ,  i've seen it a couple of times and after a while you notice that they are a few holes in the plot but the movie still keeps you entertained .  claire danes did a great job as usual ,  she is a great actress .  i would give brokedown palace 8/10
brokedown palace is truly a one of a kind .  it's an amazing story ,  showing two girl's plight for freedom against the thailand justice system .  they soon find themselves placing faith into a system they know nothing about .   alice morano  ( claire danes )  and darlene davis  ( kate beckinsale )  ,  are two best friends ,  strait out of high school .  they suddenly change their vacation plans from hawaii to thailand ,  and are immediately captivated by a young man ,  nick parks .  he flirts with them both ,  and suggests that the three of them go to hong kong for the weekend .   when the two arrive at the airport ,  they are immediately searched for drugs .  someone tipped off customs ,  and in an instant ,  their life is changed forever .  in the mix of the confusion of settling into their new life ,  they learn about a highly respected lawyer ,  named hank green  ( bill pullman )  .   an american who knows the thai justice system ,  he fights for the girl to be free .  but they soon find out ,  when they leave or go is all up to them .   if you're looking for a great movie that'll stay with you for years - brokedown palace is definitely the way to go . 
i saw this movie a million years  ( 5 years to be exact )  ago for the first the time .  in the light of recent events with the australian woman schapelle corby being imprisoned in indonesia for so called smuggling pot ,  i decided to watch this movie again .  i excepted to cry my heart out ,  'cause i'm sucker for hot girls in need  ( just read my review of 'the stalking of laurie show' )  .  some moist escaped my eyes ,  but it were hardly buckets filled with tears .  why ?  not because the two heroines weren't utterly adoring and helpless ,  not because the movie wasn't heartbreaking at the sight of these two kids in the prime of their live locked up in almost inhuman conditions .  why then ?  why did i not cry ?  i wanted to cry !  when i rent a movie like this ,  i except to be moved ,  to sob like there's no tomorrow ,  to feel miserable and like it .  this movie was simply too short to do this .  it was just like the script was reduced to the main plot elements ,  and while doing this the psychological aspect was thrown aside .  clare danes and kate beckinsale did an excellent job portraying the emotions of the two friends ,  but this movie just screamed for more footage of these girls in their depressing  ( and oppressing )  surroundings .  the mental journey is missing here for some reason .  you only get to see the key moments of it  ( which are very touching ,  i admit )  ,  probably because of bad editing .  sometimes i felt these girls were walking around in a postcard .  the relationship with the family members could also have used a bit more attention .  what's up with the relationships between the girls and the parents  ( especially between alice and her dad )  ?  you catch a glimpse of it ,  but the film doesn't quite offer the whole picture ,  sadly enough .   nonetheless this was a great movie ,  and at the end i even had to bite my lip a bit .  but i guess this has more to do with the acting skills  ( and the looks )  of the actresses  ( and the music )  then with the merit of the director .  to be honest ,  i hardly knew who kate beckinsale was before i watched this movie  ( again )  .  now ,  i am a fan !  great movie ,  as long as you don't expect it to be classic cinema . 
i saw this movie by luck ,  just because i was going through a phase where i had a new found admiration for bill pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank god i did !  this movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites !  the story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they'll learn the true meaning of freedom .   alice and darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story .  the struggle they go through as they are arrested in thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense .  the acting is amazing ,  the images extraordinary ,  the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful .  i actually can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time i watch it .  i know some people haven't appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but i swear ,  this one ,  you have to see !  !  !  i promise it will stick with you ! 
a super ,  unusual film from audiard ,  read my lips is a pulpy ,  lonely- hearts thriller .  it's perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of vincent cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from emanuelle devos .  devos is a recurring feature of audiard in the same way that karin viard pops up for jean-pierre jeunet :  unconventionally beautiful  ( she's referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film )  ,  versatile and capable of a subordinate profile .   this is almost the definition of her role as carla ,  a put-upon office dogsbody ,  taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness .  yet she finds an ami d'exploitation ,  if you like in cassel's ex-con paul .  each exploits the other's unconventional talents  ( theft and lip reading )  to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement .  devos/audiard manage carla's deafness and its attendant ,  warped inner world with discreet ,  stylish flair .   in this film  ( 2001 )  audiard is already clearly in control of his handling on tension ,  action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit - a prophet - of nine years later .  7/10
i saw this film at a store in the cheap section .  i actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago .  i thought  " what the hey' and bought it ,  basically because the plot sounded interesting and claire danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes  ( this was also before i became a huge kate beckinsale fan )  .   so it's about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in bangkok ,  get busted for narcotics  ( which they are innocent of )  and then are sent to a thailand prison .  the film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence .   both claire danes and kate beckinsale give great performances ,  and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally ,  and raises some nice moral discussion questions .   i think this is a solid good film ,  but there could have been some improvements .  it could have been longer .  .  . it would've helped to solidify these characters and more insight into the politics of thailand's justice system would've helped .   nevertheless ,  other than that ,  it's a good film with some great performances .   p . s .  for all you pop-culture junkies be on the lookout for a two-minute role by paul walker .  i didn't even notice him the first time i saw the film . 
gentleman jim is another case of print the legend ,  with errol flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath .  it's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in flynn's the charge of the light brigade - this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out ,  filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by raoul walsh's vivid direction .  flynn is still at the height of his powers  ( you'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production )  ,  with alexis smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick alan hale along for good measure ,  this time as flynn's father  ( jack carson takes sidekick duties this time )  .  indeed ,  even the pirate galleon from flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout !  the 103 minutes just breeze by . 
i meant that in a good way ,  believe me .  true to life ,  it ain't .  the whole oirish thing gets kinda thick ,  but you do enjoy the cast here-flynn ,  smith ,  bond ,  watson ,  frawley ,  etc .  all good .  i also liked seeing mike mazurki-of course he played a boxer ,  what else ?  typical forties flick teeming w/ familiar faces and fast paced scenes ,  one after the other .   flynn is fine as gentleman jim ,  you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here ,  i suppose ,  but it's okay ,  it's a cartoon and meant to please ,  that's all .  the boxing scenes were pretty good ,  ward bond's vaudeville logging act a riot ,  and you hadda like seeing all those billyclub wielding bobbies come racing into the scene a couple of times .   really alotta fun ,  flynn was on a roll at that time and it's clear to see why audiences loved him .   *** outta ****
errol flynn had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when john l .  sullivan  ( ward bond )  went around claiming that he  " could beat any man alive .  "  both flynn and ward bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen .   raoul walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style ,  capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm-hearted and full of good humor .  all the warner contract players make up the fine cast--including the always reliable alan hale as flynn's rambunctious father ,  proud of his son's fighting abilities ,  and alexis smith who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking flynn down a peg with saucy one-liners dealing with his conceited manners .   all of the 1880s atmosphere is captured in glorious b&w ,  although it's too bad warners didn't have more faith in flynn to do the film in color .  he was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time ,  engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out .   the fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen ,  with flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action .  and the scene where bond turns over his award plaque to flynn at a social gathering is one of ward's finest moments in a long career as a character actor .   summing up :  maintains interest all the way through ,  whether you're a sports fan or not . 
director raoul walsh was like the michael bay of the '40's and years before that .  and i mean that in a positive way ,  since i'm definitely ain't no bay-hater .  his movies are just simple high quality entertainment ,  just like the raoul walsh movies were in his days .    " gentleman jim "  is fine quality entertainment .  besides a first class director ,  it also features a first grade cast ,  with raoul walsh's regular leading man errol flynn in the main part .   what surprised me was how well the boxing matches were brought to the screen .  they used some very dynamic camera-work ,  which also really made the boxing matches uplifting and exciting to watch ,  with the end championship fight against john l .  sullivan as the ultimate highlight .    biopics of the '40's and earlier on were obviously still very much different from biographies being made this present day .  modern biographies often glorify its main subject and show his/her life from basically birth till death and everything ,  mostly emotional aspects ,  in between .  'old' biopics were just made the same as movies that weren't based on actual real life persons ,  which also means that the film-makers would often use a use amount of creative liberty with the main character's personality and events that happened in his/her life .  this movie is also not just a biography about a boxing legend but also forms a nice portrayal from the period when illegal bare knuckle fighting entered the modern era of boxing .   errol flynn does a great job portraying the real life famous boxer james j .  corbett aka gentleman jim .  not too many people known it but flynn did some real good acting jobs in the '40's ,  of which this movie is one .  fysicaly he also looks in top-shape .  he also looks quite different by the way without his trademark small mustache in this movie .  the movie also features some fine supporting actors and some fine acting throughout .   a great and entertaining movie that also still truly holds up real well today .   8/10
errol flynn is  " gentleman jim "  in this 1942 film about boxer jim corbett ,  known as the man who beat john l .  sullivan .  directed with a light hand by flynn's good friend ,  raoul walsh ,  the film also stars alexis smith ,  jack carson ,  alan hale sr .  ,  william frawley and ward bond .  flynn plays an ambitious ,  egotistical young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive olympic club in san francisco in the late 1800s .  though good-natured ,  the fact that he is a  " shanty irishman "  and a social climber builds resentment in olympic club members ;  most of them can't wait to see him lose a fight ,  and they bet against him .  despite this ,  he rises to fame ,  even working as an actor .  finally he gets the chance he's been waiting for ,  a match with the world champion ,  john l .  sullivan  ( ward bond )  .  sullivan demands a $10 , 000 deposit to insure that corbett will appear to fight for the $25 , 000 purse .  corbett and his manager  ( frawley )  despair of getting the money .  however ,  help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual .   this is a very entertaining film ,  and jim corbett is an excellent role for flynn ,  who himself was a professional fighter at one time .  he has the requisite charm ,  good looks and athleticism for the role .  alexis smith plays victoria ware ,  his romantic interest who insists that she hates him .  in real life ,  she doesn't seem to have existed ;  corbett was married to olive lake morris from 1886 to 1895 .   the focus of the film is on corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing .  corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is thought of as the man who made prizefighting an art form .  in the film ,  corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents ;  it is believed that he wore down john l .  sullivan this way .   good film to catch flynn at the height of his too-short time as a superstar . 
in late 1800s san francisco ,  poor well-dressed errol flynn  ( as james j .  corbett )  works at a bank ,  and enjoys attending local  " fights "   ( boxing )  with co-worker and drinking buddy jack carson  ( as walter lowrie )  .  one day ,  pretty alexis smith  ( as victoria ware )  walks into the  " comstock bank "  ,  where mr .  flynn works .  flynn is so taken with ms .  smith's elegant beauty ,  he offers to carry her withdrawal purse .  smith is secretly taken with the handsome flynn ,  but is put off by his brashness .   flynn's good deed  ( actually ,  pick-up attempt )  gets him a complimentary membership in the snooty  " olympic club "  ,  which conveniently includes a gymnasium  ( with boxing equipment )  .  however ,  flynn's presumptuous manner ,  and practical joking  ( he tickles men on the parallel bars )  irritates  " club "  members .  when an english boxing champ visits the club ,  members endeavor to get flynn to fight the man .  they are hopeful flynn will resign ,  humiliated by his defeat - but ,  flynn wins !    first time producer robert buckner puts together a nice package for warner brothers ,  and director raoul walsh .  mr .  buckner was ,  certainly ,  basking in the success of his contribution  ( screenplay )  to the studio's brilliant  " yankee doodle dandy "  .  unfortunately ,  this story is positively ludicrous .  there was a  " gentleman jim "  - this story is supposedly the filming of the real james j .  corbett's autobiography  " the roar of the crowd "  - but ,  this movie must be significantly fictionalized .   flynn is a very appealing leading man ;  he maneuvers the script lightly ,  and should have been recognized ,  by the early 1940s ,  as an excellent actor .  many of flynn's characterizations were  ( are ?  )  overlooked as great performances ,  and this is one of them .  smith does well as his feminine interest ,  deftly transmitting her emotions for the viewer .  director walsh makes the silliness look smooth and extravagant .  the supporting cast is a treasure trove ,  from boisterous alan hale  ( as pat corbett )  to walk-on lon mccallister  (  " paging mr .  corbett "  )  .   ******** gentleman jim  ( 1942 )  raoul walsh ~ errol flynn ,  alexis smith ,  alan hale
excellent warner bros effort starring errol flynn in one of his best screen performances .  it's often cited as his best ,  and i can't really judge fully until i have seen his  " dawn patrol "  .  however ,  his work in  " they died with their boots on "  takes some beating .  i'm a big flynn fan  ( he's my favourite actor after james mason--it also helps that he's an aussie )  and i think he's just marvellous ,  a great screen presence and also a great actor .  he is the centrepiece of  " gentleman jim "  as the legendary boxer with the fancy footwork ,  but he is also backed up by a literate ,  warm and funny script ,  and raoul walsh's direction .  every walsh film i have seen never loses a beat of it's pace ,  he truly was a born film-maker .  walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully ,  as he does with the lighter moments and that poignant ,  great final scene between ward bord and flynn .  add to that great production values  ( the  " gay nineties "  never looked better !  )  and a lovely supporting cast and it's pretty much perfect entertainment .  alan hale usually played flynn's sidekick ,  but here is his father ,  and it still all works .  alexis smith is flynn's love interest .  the pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other . 
just to mention one more thing about gentleman jim .  i agree with all the assessments that make this among errol flynn's greatest outings in a career of great outings .  i would think this role playing boxer jim corbett is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he was typecast as .  flynn seemed like a party animal from his memoirs and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life .  the extra thing i wanted to point out is notice the great montages ,  transitions ,  and still inserts that punctuate the film .  although the director was raoul walsh ,  a frequent collaborator with flynn ,  with cinematographer sid hickox ,  the montages were made up by an up and coming editor named don siegel .  i never knew siegel went that far back but he's listed right in the credits .  he would go on to a great career as action director himself . 
errol flynn's greatest movie ,  not just a sports movie with a wonder last 5 minutes where ward bond shines .  don't miss it just because you think its an old movie .  its a classic that could be easily missed .  do yourself a favour and don't . 
james j .  corbett ,  heavyweight champion of the world from 1892 to 1897 ,  turned out to be errol flynn's favorite role .  possibly because he didn't have to wield a sword or be in a western .  he grew tired of the swashbucklers and he said in his autobiography that he felt he was miscast in westerns and couldn't understand why people liked him in them .  it is an enjoyable film ,  but hardly does tell the real story of james j .  corbett .   as portrayed corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division ,  a man who used brains and speed more than brute strength to win .  he defeated john l .  sullivan and lost to bob fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown .  he was also a compulsive womanizer and in that was a lot like the man portraying him .  of course that was not shown on the screen .  the character that alexis smith plays ,  the banker's daughter who falls for him ,  has no basis in reality .  corbett was in fact married twice and was flagrantly unfaithful with both of his wives .   also though after he lost his title and after the events of this film are concluded he suffered a great personal tragedy .  his father in a moment of depression ,  probably over finances because he lost heavily betting on his son to beat bob fitzsimmons ,  shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself .  the murder/suicide hardly squares with the happy clan that alan hale presided over .   one thing though that i did like about gentleman jim .  ward bond got the career role of his life in playing john l .  sullivan .  director raoul walsh got a great performance out of bond as the blustering ,  but lovable sullivan .  even given some of sullivan's bad points that don't make it to the screen like rabid racism ,  bond's portrayal is the quintessential john l .  and the best thing about gentleman jim .   speaking of racism ,  one thing that should have been told was the fact that sullivan while champion refused on grounds of race to meet peter jackson who was black and from australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time .  i say probably because as a challenger corbett met him and fought him for 61 rounds to a draw .  that fight more than any other created a demand for a sullivan-corbett title match .  of course when corbett was champion he refused to give jackson a title shot .  maybe he didn't want another 61 round marathon with someone who may have been better on that particular day .   gentleman jim is not jim corbett's story ,  it is a movie of errol flynn playing at being james j .  corbett .  but corbett had he been alive in 1942 no doubt would have loved the movie and loved flynn's portrayal of his life .  it's as he would have liked to have been remembered . 
jean-jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question :  civilization makes us evil .  this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument .  in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films :  society is real ,  identity is a construction ,  freedom is criminal .  here the idea is treated literally .  both main characters find themselves ,  and each other ,  only when breaking rules .  this discovery may well hold true in france ;  at any rate ,  it's quite romantic . 
if you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer james corbett ,  then this is probably not the film for you .  the famed boxer receives a 1940s  " hollywood-ization "  of his life--making the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life .  however ,  because the performances were so good  ( particularly by errol flynn )  and the script so likable ,  the film's embellishments can be forgiven .   errol flynn plays gay nineties-era boxer james  " gentleman jim "  corbett--a man who became world boxing champ in 1892 .  the film goes from his rather humble beginnings and follows his through his career through him winning the title match against john l .  sullivan .  however ,  while it could have focused mostly on the matches ,  most are rather brief in the film  ( except for the final title match )  and the emphasis is on corbett's brash personality as well as his relationship with the lady played by alexis smith .  throughout the film ,  there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting actors  ( such as the perennial supporting actor in flynn films ,  alan hale )  and the writing really helped bring these people alive .   what is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of flynn as a boxer .  while a few of the shots are of doubles ,  almost all the boxing scenes are of flynn and he did a convincing job as a pugilist .  this was a nice departure for flynn ,  who generally played  " pretty boy "  roles or swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character he was .  to find out more about this ,  try reading a biography of him--he was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to hollywood .   now as for the real james corbett ,  read on if you aren't afraid of finding out how the movie isn't accurate .  first ,  corbett was not a poor guy coming from a poor family ,  but was college educated and bright .  second ,  while he did get alexis smith at the end of the film ,  they also divorced a few years later .  third ,  the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between sullivan and corbett was probably the best part of the film ,  sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happened--in reality ,  sullivan was more the egomaniac and corbett was not the fat-headed guy they portrayed in the film--though it made for a lovely film . 
this is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by hollywood .  what a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of american history .  what makes the story of james j .  corbett especially interesting is that mr .  corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day .  in that respect james j .  corbett was truly innovated .  but getting back to the movie ,  all the performances were excellent .  alexis smith was beautiful .  indeed ,  she looked like nicole kidman .  and although it's a period piece ,  the story withstands the test of time ;  it has not gone stale .  ward bond's portrayal of john l .  sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic ,  well-staged and highly effective .  that coupled with a great script makes this movie a must . 
i consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling  " gentleman jim "  the best boxing movie ever made .  that is the robert wise/paul newman flick  " somebody up there likes me .  "  that movie might be number 1 ,  but  " gentleman jim "  is a close number 2 .   the movie doesn't just chronicle the rise of james j .  corbett ,  it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition .  in the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more  " gentlemanly "  days of the gloved ,  marquis of queensbury rules .  and the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability .    " gentleman jim "  is not a realistic look at those days .  it is romanticized and ,  yes ,  even a bit hokey at times .  but always delightfully so .  errol flynn is perfect as the  " gentleman "  jim who really isn't a  " gentleman "  at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family .  alexis smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship  ( and we all know it is ,  of course ,  love that will win that match in the end )  .   at the end of  " gentleman jim "  the great john l sullivan  ( whose famous line was not  " i can lick any man in the world "  of course .  .  . romanticism again )  hands over his belt to corbett .  this is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made .  realistic ?  no .  but wonderful .  hey ,  if you want realism watch  " raging bull "  instead .  that is a much more realistic boxing movie .  but  " gentleman jim "  is a lot more fun . 
loosely based on the james j corbett biography  " the roar of the crowd "  ,  gentleman jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was corbett ,  but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the 1890s .   the story follows corbett {a perfectly casted errol flynn} from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in san fransico ,  thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world ,  john l sullivan {beefcake personified delightfully by ward bond} .  not all the fights are in the ring tho ,  and it's all the spin off vignettes in corbett's life that makes this a grand entertaining picture .  there are class issues to overcome here {perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two} ,  and corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers ,  but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does .  along with the quite wonderful corbett family ,  and all their stoic humorous support ,  corbett's journey is as enthralling as it is joyous ,  yet as brash and as bold as he is ,  he is a very likable character ,  and it's a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of gentleman jim .   the film never sags for one moment ,  and it's a testament to director raoul walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight ,  the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained ,  not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture {thank you alexis smith} .  the fight sequences stand up really well ,  and they perfectly show just how corbett became the champ he was ,  his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history .  as the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between sullivan and corbett puts all the brutality into context ,  and it's here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner ,  and as far as this viewer goes .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . it will do for me to be sure to be sure ,  9/10 for a truly wonderful picture . 
gentleman jim not really a boxing film .  it is a vehicle for errol flynn as jim corbett .  but having said that ,  the boxing scenes are a real eye-opener to the modern viewer .  there are no 12 round ,  points decisions here .   errol flynn plays the irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title .  flynn is well suited to the role of suave but unpredictable corbett .  his opponent john sullivan is still better however ,  a bruiser of the old school played by ward bond .   the theme of the film is a man pushing for his big chance .  corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new persona as gentleman jim .  jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment .  he is a liar and an egotist .  sullivan the heavyweight boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character .   there is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all .  and errol flynn gets the girl . 
flynn ,  known mostly for his swashbuckling roles  ( and his bedroom antics !  )  takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully .  playing real-life boxing champ jim corbett ,  flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist ,  all the while setting one eye on society deb smith .  he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare-knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men  ( and a dog !  )  including a prominent judge .  the next day ,  he gets a chance ,  via smith ,  to gain entrance to the judge's private club .  he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club's resident boxer .  his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers ,  up to and including the world champion john l .  sullivan  ( bond .  )  flynn is downright magical here .  he is the epitome of charm ,  charisma and appeal in this role .  he looks terrific  ( especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit )  and does virtually all of his own stuntwork  ( impressively !  )  his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally .  smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn .  at this stage ,  he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation  ( he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time )  and she does so admirably .  she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude ,  yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell .  bond is incredibly burly ,  brawny and towering ,  yet tender when the script calls for it .  amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson .  frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn's manager .  the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types .  the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed .  a few of the sets are amazingly presented .  some of smith's gowns border on the garish ,  but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well .  it's a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing ,  but it's also so much more .  some of it  ( like the character traits shown by flynn )  is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes ,  but a lot of it is authentic  ( like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes .  )  one line is particularly memorable :   " i believe you like me more than i like you ,  but it's entirely possible that i love you more than you love me .  "  it's classic romantic dialogue  ( and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well .  ) 
some saying about 'the play is the most important thing' ,  or something like that ,  is attributed to that old bard of avon ,  himself ,  william shakewspeare .  if it wasn't old will ,  it may well have been our own ,  super-veteran film director ,  mr .  raoul walsh .  there are a large number of his films that would support this hypothesis .  none are more appropriate than gentleman jim ( warner brothers ,  1942 )  .   the film also racks up another award ,  being named as errol flynn's favourite of his own starring vehicles .  it clearly gives on screen evidence that would easily lead viewers sitting in the darkened theatre ,  or viewing it on their home tv or dvd ,  to conclude same .   to be sure ,  the story is a semi-serious biopic ,  which takes a portion of factual material and blends it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to bring us a very satisfying ,  albeit somewhat fictionalized ( what biopic isn't ?  ) occurrences .   the casting is excellent ,  as it makes good use of the natural athleticism of our lead ,  mr .  errol flynn .  though not a swashbuckler ,  a western or a war picture ,  this gentleman jim is perhaps the starring role that was the best fit for the rugged australian .   errol was a member of the australian olympic boxing team in either 1928 or 1932 .  his training and skills in the 'sweet science'are clearly in evidence throughout the film and especially in the  " big fight "  for the world's heavyweight boxing championship with the great john l . sullivan , himself .  ( played in expert fashion by ward bond )  the cast reads like a duty roster of warner brothers' resident supporting players .  it features alan hale as jim corbet's father ,  a livery wagon operator* .  his two brothers are harry and george  ( pat flaherty and james flavin )  ,  the two 'blue collar' men of the family ,  their occupations being stated as being 'longshormen' .   the great jack carson does his usual masterful serio-comic performance in support as jim corbett's friend and fellow bank teller .  the rest of those we can both recognize and remember are : john loder ,  william frawley , madeleine lebeau ,  minor watson ,  rhys williams , arthur shields , dorothy vaughn to name but a few .   director walsh also used a number of pro wrestlers in roles of various boxers .  hence we have ed  " strangler "  lewis and an unknown grappler* are featured as the 2 waterfront pugs in the opening scenes .  others were sammy stein ,  mike mazurki ( ever hear of him ?  ) and  " wee willie "  davis .  these guys had a powerful , yet unpolished look about them that the old pier 9 brawlers would have possessed .   we haven't forgotten leading lady ,  alexis smith .  she is powerful in her characterization of an  " independent "  woman ,  yet maintains enough true ability as a comic player in many of the scenes .  she displays quite a range in her part as poor little rich girl ,  victoria lodge .   with all these ingredients at hand ,  the trick is how to mix the elements in proper proportions to give it the 'just right' blend .  well ,  director walsh does so with a reckless abandon .  because he is looking for ,  above all ,  a great film .  his treatment shows all of the skills he had honed to a fine tuning starting with his days as a player with d . w .  griffith .  mr .  walsh seems to have a special fondness for that period ,  the 1890's . *** mr .  walsh's direction moves through the script at a fairly fast clip ,  breaking up the exposition scenes with a humorous punch-line ,   " the corbetts are at it again !  "  hence ,  he is able to maintain a light ,  even humorous touch to a story which could become too drab and serious .   furthermore ,  in an almost unnoticed element ,  brother walsh gives us an authentic look of a san francisco of the 1890's .  and as a further example of his fondness for that period ,  he creates wide ,  dynamic images of the historic prize fights .  there is a vibrant ,  joyful mood conveyed in those boxing scenes .  as a crowning glory to this great ,  perhaps underrated film ,  director walsh gave the image a look as if it were an illustration from the police gazette ,  which covered such events in those  " old days "  .   but there's just one thing to remember before viewing .  if it is for the first time ,  or if your seeing it once more :    " the corbets are at it again !  !  "   * in my humble opinion as a historian of both film and pro wrestling ,  it looks like tor johnson ,  who years later was a favourite of director ed wood's .   ** a 'livery' is a somewhat archaic term for a vehicle for hire for local city transportation .   *** it's true .  mr .  raoul walsh was a griffith veteran player .  he was the actor to portray john wilkes booth in the birth of a nation ( 1915 )  .   **** being born in 1887 ,  raoul walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890's and of the sullivan-corbett championship bout and what it meant to the sporting life in the america of those days . 
james j .  corbett's autobiography  " the roar of the crowd "  was the starting point of this lively and well-remembered fictionalized biography .  the author was heavyweight champion of the world ,  succeeding john l .  sullivan ,  before the turn of the century .  the events of the narrative depict corbett as a brash but likable and intelligent young man whose conquest of the world of boxing and social prejudice in his time ,  when he was considered merely the son of irish immigrants ,  a lowly bank teller and a nobody surprised everyone .  it took him several hours of exciting and often amusing screen-time to prove his compeers were wrong .  he is an bank teller when the film opens ,  but he somehow wangles an invitation to a sporting club for the well-to-do .  he falls in love with a beautiful but snobbish girl ,  with whom he always seems to be quarreling ,  and he lives at home with a brawling clan of corbetts who seem to fight with one another as often as with others .  when he defeats the club's best and a professional fighter borough in to embarrass him ,  he finally decides to become famous by fighting .  he sets out on the road with his friend ,  who acts as manager and trainer ,  and despite a few near setbacks ,  he wins all his bouts and attracts attention .  coming home to pursue his girl again ,  he contrives to annoy the boston strongboy ,  mighty john l .  sullivan ,  who enters bars and claims he can  " lick any man in the world "  .  few believe he can win a bout against sullivan ,  but corbett ,  dubbed  " gentleman jim "  for his gracious manners and patrician appearance surprises everyone by moving ,  dancing out of range ,  and negating the furious sullivan's power .  the film's finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten sullivan comes to congratulate corbett .  the new champion rises to the moment ,  tells sullivan a few years before it might have been different ,  and shows him nothing but admiration and respect .  he gets his girl as a result of his two performances ,  but by the end of the film ,  as they visit his s parents ,  his manager is able to tell the world ,   " the corbetts are at it again "  .  the films is attractive and has a consistent style without being flashy .  the script was written by veteran horace mccoy and vincent lawrence from the corbett novel .  sidney hickox did the cinematography ,  with period set decorations by clarence steensen and art direction by ted smith .  heinz roemheld did the music and milo anderson the gowns .  the film was ably directed by action-film specialist raoul walsh .  flynn also liked working with walsh but did not care for the other director he worked for most often ,  michael curtiz .  among the cast , were ward bond as john l .  sullivan ,  in one of his best performances lovely alexis smith a bit spotty but intelligent as the girl corbett loves and a very able errol flynn as corbett ,  a young man he seemed to relish playing--he later said it was his favorite role from the period .  .  . jack carson was his manager ,  alan hale his charismatic father ,  john loder a rich foe ,  with william frawley ,  minor watson ,  madeleine lebeau ,  rhys williams ,  arthur shields ,  dorothy vaughn and mike mazurki along for the enjoyable proceedings .  it is hard to say enough about the logic and light-hearted fun this movie's makers have generated ;  it is one of the best-liked of all sports biography films ,  and by my standards one of the most enjoyable as well . 
this film enhanced my opinion of errol flynn .  while flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura  ( to throw in a couple of high-falutin' european terms !  )  ,  this film gives him an opportunity to stretch  ( albeit only slightly )  as an actor ,  as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match .  the supporting cast is excellent ;  everyone seems well-chosen for their roles .   the story moves briskly and ,  while not particularly profound  ( it misses ,  perhaps intentionally ,  the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time )  ,  it certainly entertains and satisfies .  from what i know of jim corbett ,  the story is also reasonably faithful to history .  i also really liked the great depictions of 1880s san francisco .  all in all ,  there's little not to like about this film .  .  . very well worth the time to watch it . 
interesting characters ,  lots of tension .  as close to black and white without being black and white .  i was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character ,  a quiet ,  near deaf secretary ,  was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues ,  rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist ,  and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get-away .  i'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks .  in this film we never know who's money it really is they abscond with ,  or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf-secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot .  too bad ,  the film could have been great . 
well ,  i am delighted to hear a rumor that this may finally be issued on dvd .  when that will happen ,  i don't know ,  but i will grab it when it's released .   in my humble opinion ,  this is errol flynn's most entertaining film ,  especially when  " gentleman jim "  corbett's ring career begins in the film .  then it goes from a good film to a great one .   few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likable good guy as well as flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that .  reportedly ,  this was flynn's favorite role and i believe that .  you can just sense how much fun he was having here .  ward bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous john l .  sullivan .  bond ,  too ,  was never better .   there is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done ,  too .  corbett's family is fun to watch ,  too ,  as they carry on in the stands during jim's matches .  out of the arena ,  corbett's family's constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion .   and speaking of the conclusion ,  sullivan's speech to corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film .  some mean-spirited critics  ( variety ,  for example )  didn't like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but - duh - most films are fictionalized ,  like it or not .  and ,  in this case ,  it made for a nice story and nice ending .   ( in real life ,  corbett was a very soft-spoken true gentleman ,  not anything like flynn's portrayal ,  but flynn still make him a good guy .  )   this is one of the more entertaining classic films i have ever watched and i eagerly wait for the dvd . 
if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie .  if you are young or old then you will love this movie ,  hell even my mom liked it .   great camp !  !  ! 
hilarious film .  i saw this film at the 2002 sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival ,  and laughed from start to finish .  the acting was subtle but very funny .  i'm not entirely certain about  " the real world "  influence ,  we don't get that here ,  but the film holds up without the understanding of that show .  heather b steals every scene she appears in ,  most notably when acting with her seldom talkative red co-star .  highly recommended .  i'd love to see this released on video/dvd some time in the future . 
this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen .  if you know the real world and the people from those shows ,  this movie will be top notch ,  if you have never seen the real world you will still think it is an extremely funny movie but you won't get some of the inside jokes about the actors and the tv show . 
an entertaining kung fu film ,  with acting ,  plot and fight scenes a cut above the average chop socky .  all of the cast are likeable characters and skilled martial artists .  alexander fu-sheng's proto-jackie chan comedy antics are fun to watch ,  and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills .  for me ,  the film's only glaring flaw is the size of the cast -- at times ,  things get a little confused as the film chops and changes between various subplots ,  and some of the characters are not as fully fleshed-out as one might wish .   but a kung fu film should be judged first and foremost on the quality of the action ,  and shaolin temple definitely delivers on that count .  the film climaxes with a high-bodycount battle that allows each character to show off his skills against a worthy opponent .   overall ,  shaolin temple is an enjoyable low-budget kung fu movie .  not up to the quality of a good jet li film ,  but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre .  my rating :  8/10 .   misc notes :  the 1987 warner home video release i saw was  ( predictably )  poorly dubbed ,  and lacked full cast & crew credits . 
the only kung fu epic worth watching .  the best training ever .  the main character spending a hundred day's on his knees outside the shaolin temple show how desperate he is to learn kung fu to fight the manchu dogs who have taken over china . 
chang cheh's  " shaolin temple "  might very well be the highwater mark of the shaw brothers martial arts film cycle .  this rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast - a veritable who's who of the shaw stable .  though the plot is fairly standard and the fight choreography is superb as usual ,  it is cheh's handling of the subject matter that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable .  the sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the shaolin temple is palpable in every frame .  not unlike william keighley's paean to the fabled fighting 69th in that same self titled film or john ford's salute to west point in  " the long gray line ,  "  cheh's  " shaolin temple "  is a lovingly crafted ode in that same style .   the cultural correlation i am tempted to make ,  is to compare the shaolin temple to the alamo .  watching this film will give the same admiring and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in grade school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed heroes of the alamo .  at the end of the film ,  you too might be tempted to call out ,  remember the shaolin temple ! 
the idea's which are shown in this film are with a lot of care and detail and depict what a lot of people from around the world think of the american policies ,  not neccessarily the united states itself .  it shows what most of the people around the world think about america and what the americans dont know about themselves .  11 directors showing 11 amazing minutes each of something which will give us viewers a lot to think about when they go home after watching the movie . 
  everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors .  that is to say that what might be number one priority for people like bush ,  blair and company ,  may not be so for a great many other people ,  ordinary people .  from the opening scene in which an iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that has happened ,  with the result the children are not impressed ,  as the death of a neighbour and things like that evidently affect them much more closely than anything which may have happened in new york ,  usa ,  wherever that is ,  this series of almost documentary styled pieces establishes that not all things are as equal unto all men as some world leaders would try to prophess .    whereas ,  obviously ,  the attack on the wtc was a dastardly event by any yardstick ,  one does get the impression that both politicians and tv cameramen tend to blow up things out of all proportion - wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces .  would the same reaction at international level have occurred if the attack had been made on lagos ,  say ,  or djakarta ,  say ,  or even on rio de janeiro ,  say ?  i rather think not .  news seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen :  much more tv time is given to an earthquake in italy ,  say ,  than one ten times more destructive in outer mongolia ,  say .  greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster .    this series of eleven pieces helps to put things in better perspective - or ,  perhaps i should say ,  some of the pieces do ,  as each director with complete freedom has made up his own story ,  his own translated perspective ,  such that it is not possible to judge the whole merits ,  but individually for each eleven-minute segment .    in no way should one deduce that this is an anti-american film :  that would be a too simple reading of the diverse messages manifested through the segments .  however ,  it is not pro-american either .  the eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common link - if there is one - is that the disaster of the wtc attack has to be seen in perspective from different view-points .  only then will such people as george bush even begin to comprehend the planet he is living on .    clearly stated in one segment is a belief of mine i have been harbouring for two years now :  america has not learnt the lesson .  and the lesson is that the usa has to share this planet with the rest of humanity - not dominate it by ruthless economical persuasion or just plain force .  instead of learning that the usa cannot continue just stamping all over everybody and everywhere ,  its political leaders ,  aided and abetted by blair  ( and even aznar )  have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant ,  which is not doing any good to anyone in afghanistan or irak at present ,  let alone much elsewhere .  the white house mentality is totally rejectable :  the us and uk invaded irak and caused all the chaos ,  and so should clear up the mess they caused - not insist on the un and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil .    radical stances adopted by the us  ( or even israel )  is only going to be met by radical stances from islamic people ,  who for years have been gearing up fanatical fundamentalism ,  if only to cover up their own macho uselessness ,  i . e .  ,  stoning women to death or simply shrouding them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground .    the world is in a terrible mess ,  fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives .  this film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture . 
a great idea :  11 stories about 11 september .  11 directors from different countries with different results .  ken loach talking about an immigrant  ( as usual )  is just brilliant  ( as usual )  .  the frenchman does a very good job also ,  while the burkina faso film was a nice surprise .  however ,  the israel film was a bit boring ,  and the mexican guy ,  well ,  he should quit directing and work in a mexican restaurant .  8/10
first than anything ,  i'm not going to praise iñarritu's short film ,  even i'm mexican and proud of his success in mainstream hollywood .   in another hand ,  i see most of the reviews focuses on their favorite  ( and not so )  short films ;  but we are forgetting that there is a subtle bottom line that circles the whole compilation ,  and maybe it will not be so pleasant for american people .   ( even if that was not the main purpose of the producers )    what i'm talking about is that most of the short films does not show the suffering that wasp people went through because the terrorist attack on september 11th ,  but the suffering of the other people .   do you need proofs about what i'm saying ?  look ,  in the bosnia short film ,  the message is :   " you cry because of the people who died in the towers ,  but we  ( the others = east europeans )  are crying long ago for the crimes committed against our women and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you "  .   even though the burkina fasso story is more in comedy ,  there is a the same thought :   " you are angry because osama bin laden punched you in an evil way ,  but we  ( the others = africans )  should be more angry ,  because our people is dying of hunger ,  poverty and aids long time ago ,  and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you "  .   look now at the sean penn short :  the fall of the twin towers makes happy to a lonely  ( and alienated )  man .  so the message is that the power and the greed  ( symbolized by the towers )  must fall for letting the people see the sun rise and the flowers blossom ?  it is remarkable that this terrible bottom line has been proposed by an american .  there is so much irony in this short film that it is close to be subversive .   well ,  the ken loach  ( very know because his anti-capitalism ideology )  is much more clearly and shameless in going straight to the point :   " you are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces ,  but we  ( the others = latin americans )  suffered at a similar date something worst ,  and nobody remembers our grief as the whole world has done to you "  .   it is like if the creative of this project wanted to say to americans :   " you see now ,  america ?  you are not the only that have become victim of the world violence ,  you are not alone in your pain and by the way ,  we  ( the others = the non americans )  have been suffering a lot more than you from long time ago ;  so ,  we are in solidarity with you in your pain .  .  .  and by the way ,  we are sorry because you have had some taste of your own medicine "  only the mexican and the french short films showed some compassion and sympathy for american people ;  the others are like a slap on the face for the american state ,  that is not equal to american people . 
after erasing my thoughts nearly twenty-seven times ,  there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama ,   " read my lips "  .  having written over five hundred reviews ,  i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiard's subtle ,  yet inspirational love story .  thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film ,  and while the  " loves "  overpowered ,  it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind .   " read my lips "  is a drama .  to be more precise ,  is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work .  here is where this review begins to crumble ,  it is all of these items  but it is moremuch ,  much more .  as a viewer ,  you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos' portrayal of this fragile woman named carla ,  whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty .  audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid ,  causing an immediate unrest ,  not only from the characters within the film ,  but to those watching .  without sound ,  the world is left open to any possibility ,  and that is frightening .   as we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life ,  we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul  ( played exquisitely by vincent cassel )  ,  a slicked-back hair ,  mustache-wearing lanky man who was just released from prison ,  homeless ,  jobless ,  and forced by his parole officer to get a job .  this is how carla and paul meet .  there is that moment of instant ,  unsettling attraction .  the one where we think she loves him ,  but he is dark  ( and here is where it gets even more fun )   and where we think he loves her ,  but she is dark .  the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown .  who ,  as viewers ,  are we to feel the most sympathy for ?  paul sleeps in the office ,  carla helps him ;  carla looses a contract to a rival co-worker ,  paul helps her ;  carla's ability to read people's lips comes in handy for a make-shift idea for paul .  the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair ,  waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave .  it never does .  audiard cannot just allow this story to take place ,  he continually introduces us to more characters ;  one just as seedy as the next .  even our rock ,  our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing  a subplot to this film that at first angered me ,  but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film .  yet none of this could have happened if it weren't for our characters .  devos' solemn and homely look is breathtaking ,  as she changes her image for paul ;  the truth of her beauty is discovered .  paul ,  the wildcard in the film ,  continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame .  then ,  just as we assume one ,  carla takes on one last shape .   audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters .  cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair .  the story ,  probably the weakest part of this film ,  is at first random .  the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first ,  but audiard lets them connect bit by bit .  again ,  the entire parole officer segment was tangent ,  but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means .  not attempting to sound vague ,  but this complex  ( yet utterly simple )  story is difficult to explain .  there is plenty happening ,  but it is up to you to connect the pieces .  a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held .  that use of sound and scene was brilliant .  it was tense ,  it was dramatic ,  and it was like watching a who-dun-it mystery unfold before your eyes .   overall ,  i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over  i was proved wrong .   " read my lips "  opens the floor for discussion ,  not just with the characters ,  but the situations .  one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene ,  and paul in the next .  when a discovery is made in paul's apartment by carla ,  i found myself deeply angry .  audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development ,  and what he was lacking in plot  the actors were able to carry .  i can easily suggest this film to anyone ,  but be prepared ;  this isn't a one time viewing film .  repeat .  repeat .  repeat .   grade :  **** out of *****
the movie is great ,  like every other international project that includes strong impressions .  three of them  ( israel ,  bosnia and egypt )  should've been cut out .  especially bosnian clip ,  which is pathetic beyond all reason ,  and doesn't contain a single original thought or element on it's own .  everything else is really great ,  unrecognizable for most of americans ,  known for the rest of the world .  unfortunately ,  clips speak about misery of the people all over the world .  and ,  as i see it ,  there are so many of those who won't give a damn about it .  .  .   top 5 :  1 .  loach 2 .  penn 3 .  inarritu 4 .  lalouche 5 .  imamura
very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves .  i can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write .  this film simply smacked of the real world :  the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter ,  the live-in relatives and their quarrels ,  the troubled child who gets knocked up and then ,  typically ,  drops out of school ,  a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it .  2 thumbs up . 
first of all ,  i don't understand why some people find this movie so anti-american .  sure ,  there are moments when the u . s .  are accused directly ,  like at the segments of youssef chahine ,  ken loach and ,  to a certain extent ,  mira nair .  but come on ,  they aren't naive accusations ;  instead ,  they are based on real and documented facts ,  and all the documents that the cia released about chile confirms this ,  for example .   but returning to the film itself ,  what i enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it .  we find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event ;  we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day ;  we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of september 11 and react differently to this ,  with dignity or frustration ;  we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness .   all these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of september 11th .  thus ,  what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks ,  and this may make some people infuriated ;  but this is the world where we live ,  and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies ,  regardless of what presidents or priests may say us .   finally ,  i think it's a shame that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the united states of america .  it's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened ,  and this movie could give some clues to them .  this film puts very clearly - differently of what some people of this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future ,  and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today . 
probably the best film of the year for me .  this small french film centers on put upon office secretary carla  ( emmanuelle devos )  who spends her days doing other men's jobs ,  uncredited ,  and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as ,  being partially deaf ,  she reads lips .  a change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con paul  ( vincent cassel )  as her assistant .  the relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film .  mutual dependency ,  for vastly different reasons ,  bonds them .  carla becomes attracted to paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for , what seems like , the first time .  paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help .  he owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve carlas' skill of reading lips .  i think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspense/drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars .  throughout the whole film ,  no matter what other characters are on screen ,  you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul .  i cannot remember when i have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors .  emmanuell devos gives a brilliant performance  ( she won the french cesar for best actress )  .  you never feel like you are watching a piece of acting ,  this really is carla .  the chameleon like vincent cassel is also wonderful .  he makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive .  i loved this film because of these two people ,  and both times when i had finished watching it i wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again . 
this is the greatest film i saw in 2002 ,  whereas i'm used to mainstream movies .  it is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films .  from the technical info  ( the chosen directors )  ,  i feared it would have an anti-american basis ,  but  .  .  .  it's a kind of  ( 11 times )  personal tribute .   the weakest point comes from y .  chahine  :  he does not manage to  " swallow his pride "  and considers this event as a well-merited punishment  .  .  .  it is really the weakest part of the movie ,  but this testifies of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece .  the weirdest comes from the mexican nearly conceptual-art film  .  .  .  i am still not sure what a .  gonzalez inarritu meant .  the 9 others are perfect  ( k .  loach ,  s .  penn ,  s .  makhmalbaf ,   .  .  .  )  or nearly perfect  ( c .  lelouch )  and made me either smile ,  or cry or even left me stunned .  i still don't know if s .  imamura's fable is really related or not to the september 11th catastrophe ,  but it is so pretty that its finale place deeply 'makes it' . 
this is a very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant .  gathering 11 prominent international directors and allotting each of them 11 minutes ,  9 seconds and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice ;  each short exploring the global reverberations of 9/11 .  without using any spoilers ,  i would say that ken loach's piece is the jewel in the crown ,  and mira nair's short  ( segment  " india "  )  ,  based on a true story ,  deserves to be made into a full feature film .  one also realizes ,  while watching his short ,  why alejandro gonzález iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today  he simply is a master of the medium ,  who has also a profound understanding of the subject matter .  unfortunately ,  not all 11 parts are made as well .  youssef chahine ,  in his segment  " egypt "  ,  assumes the arab stance of the self-inflicted collective guilt ,  which piece could have potentially been the most interesting one .  he fails miserably .  chahine's short is poorly written and badly executed ,  at least enough to stand out amongst other ,  superior chapters of the film .  despite the imbalance in quality ,  i would still give the film 7/10 for concept ,  if not for execution . 
i just recently watched this on the sundance channel .  the idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers ,  illustrious in their own country ,  to make short films ,  eleven of them ,  all in one film ,  concentrating on just one subject :  september 11 .   from wacthing this movie i could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all elements of a great film .   the movie starts off with a film from iran in which a teacher struggles to teach the students about what had happened with september 11 which they fail to realize until later .   the second film from france involves a deaf women who writes a letter to her lover angrily while she is unaware of what is going as the t . v plays .   the next film from egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking with a dead soldier about recent events not only about terrorists of 9/11 but bombings in other places .   the next comes from bolivia in which a girl learns about the events of september 11 and believes they must march for them .   the next from a country in africa in which a group of boys follow a man whom they believe to be bin ladin .   the next comes from mexico in which nothing is shown but the sounds of that day .   the next from israel involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report but is frequently told about the attacks .   there are other films that i can't remember at the moment but all of them are powerful .  it will bring back your emotions from that day .   10/10
ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces  ( i found only the egyptian one disappointing )  .  stragely ,  all but the mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11 :  the afghan refugees ,  deaf people ,  palestinians ,  the widows of srebrenica ,  aids and poverty and corruption in africa ,  pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath ,  suicide bombings in israel ,  paranoia-hit and state-persecuted muslim americans in the usa ,  old people living alone ,  and the aftermath of wwii in the hearts of asian soldiers .  this might say something sad about the limits of empathy ,  in both ways :  the directors might feel that americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies ,  while they effectively do the same with their short films .   surprising myself ,  i found sean penn's piece one of the very best in the collection ,  and ***spoiler ahead*** i also guess his portrayal of ernest borgnine as a half-crazy old man vegetating in a new york flat experiencing his widow life's happiest moment when the sun shines through his window after the wtc  " collapsed out of light's way "  ,  i guess this might also be one of the most offending as the general american audience would see it . 
a patchwork about 911 .  the 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humoristic ,  sometimes boring  ( the first one ,  for example )  ,  sometimes used to say to americans  " we have had more deaths than you ,  and you supported the murderers "  ,  sometimes really weird  ( but highly symbolic and interesting )  .  i really loved the claude lelouch  ( personal live of a couple in new-york ,  showing that our day-to-day  " problems "  are unimportant )  ,  shoei imamura  ( bizarre ,  strongly anti-wars in general )  ,  and idrissa ouedraogo  ( funny ,  typical african optimism despite terrible day to day misery )  ,  and youssef chahine  ( an egyptian intellectual ,  pro-peace ,  having moral difficulties to accept the u . s .  policy towards arab countries )  i am really pleased to see that many americans liked this movie .  it shows that we  ( or they  ?  i am still belgian ,  but living in texas for 12 years )  are still interested by other cultures ,  and able to question past and present actions of our government ,  like we should in a democracy . 
i chose to see the this film on the day it opened nationally in france ,  as a personal way for myself to reflect on what had happened a year previous ;  the collection works as intended :  it provokes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions ,  working as an intellectual hommage ,  never stooping to cheap sentimentality nor knee-jerk reactionism .   there have been many allegations made that the film is anti-american :  while i cannot speak for everyone in this regard ,  i am one american who found such statements to be completely untrue .  people make much noise about the egyptian segment ,  by chahine ,  because it voices perspectives of palestinian suicide bombers asserting that civilians in a democracy are  " fair targets "  for they elect the governments the bombers are seeking to attack ,  but this ignores much else in the piece :  several perspectives are discussed ,  no one being held up as the truth ,  and critics--if they even saw the piece--seem to forget the fondness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the american dialogue ,  and the director's intense sadness upon hearing of the tragedy .   pretty much all of the films are beautiful ,  thoughtful & inspiring ,  in particular the brilliant work by mahkmalbaf ,  tanovic ,  loach & inarritu .  nair ,  good as usual ,  effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a muslim family in the wake of anti-islam hysteria that swept--and still sweeps--the states .  i did find gitai's piece a bit vulgarly loud and simple in it's critic of media hysteria in the face of terrorism ,  and penn's piece was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes ,  though i had expected to like it .  borgnine is very good and brave in it .  spoiler warning :  one reviewer below incorrectly read the falling of the towers as being a happy moment for the character ;  my read is rather that the falling of the towers is what ,  because light floods his room ,  keys him into the loss in his life that he refused to recognize .  again this is a sort of impressionistic piece ,  for we know that if the towers were really blocking the light to this man's flat ,  then there would have been nothing but smoke and ash ,  not light ,  flooding through his window . 
this is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world .  the documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts ,  the only thing being shared is 9/11 as a theme  ( very minor in some cases )  .  some of the segements are weak while others are very strong ;  some are political ,  some are not ;  some are solely about 9/11 ,  some simply use 9/11 as a theme to touch on human feelings ,  emotions and tragedies that are universal ;  some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic )  .  this film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful .   this is a very controversial film ,  especially for conservative americans .  i think two segments might really tick off the right wingers  ( one from egypt where a dead american soldier and a dead palestinian bomber come back as spirits ;  another from uk which recounts the us-backed overthrow of chile on sept 11 ,  1973 ,  which resulted in 50 , 000 deaths and horrible atrocities )  .  the segment from mexico was the most powerful ,  recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion  ( you have to see it to believe it )  .   even though the final product is uneven ,  with some segments being almost  " pointless "  ,  i still recommend this .  it's very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place  ( some weak ,  some very powerful ;   )  .  i'm giving this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored  ( mexico segment ,  uk segment ,  japan segment ,  egypt segment )  . 
first of all i've got to give it to the people that got this thing together .  9/11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts .  it's a shame ,  although not surprising ,  that the movie was banned in the us .   that being said i think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments .  the movie starts up with the iranian segment which turns out to be somewhat reminiscent of majid majidi's work  ( the absolutely beautiful  " heaven's children "  and  " the color of paradise "  )  .  much like those 2 films the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of afgan refugees in iran .  absolutely beautiful clip .  same goes for sean penn's clip which is superb as well .  but just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal .  alejandro gonzáles iñárritu does the mexican clip and just like his gut-wrenching  " amores perros "  he does it as brutal as he can .  most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background .  those sounds are of the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes ,  those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families ,  those who were angry .  .  .  . and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers .  a very hard clip to watch and one that you won't forget .   some clips could turn out to be very hard to watch for americans as some of the clips could be interpreted as  " you're not the only ones that are suffering "  .  in particular the egyptian and british clips that not only say that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the us has caused to other people .   i will also make a special mention to the clips from bosnia-herzegovina ,  france ,  india and japan  ( although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually isn't )  .   however ,  not all the clips are great and i make a special mention on the clip from israel which ,  in my opinion ,  is extremely weak .  while the idea was good  ( a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in tel aviv but his story gets bumped because of what happened in new york is something that a lot of us who live in countries at war can relate to )  the realization is terrible .  the clip ends up as just some entertainment reporter trying to get some air-time at all costs ,  a guy saying he's a witness and hoping that he can go on tv ,  and soldiers and paramedics shouting just  " because "  .  the clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation .   if you happen to have the chance to see it then you should ,  that is ,  unless you're a conservative in which case you'd better stay out as you might get offended .  but if you're not then you might learn how many of us outside the us lived through 9/11 . 
this document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the united states thought about the september 11th attacks .  this film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on u . s .  soil .  the aftermath of this disaster is previewed from many different countries and perspectives .  i believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point .  it also helps in the the healing process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks .  and some of the pieces are actually funny ,  but not abusively so .  this film came highly recommended to me ,  and i pass on the same feeling . 
i first saw this film when it aired on the now defunct trio channel a few years ago ,  and recently watched it again--sans commercials--on sundance .  i was impressed the first time ,  and found it even more engaging on second viewing .  yes ,  some of the segments are far from perfect--amos gitai's hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumb--but taken collectively ,  11 09 01 is a total success .  best of show :  shohei imamura's amazing final segment ,  which contemporary critics such as the thick-witted mick lasalle somehow misinterpreted as an attack on 'the terrorists' ,  but now stands revealed as a masterful anti-war polemic ;  samira makhmalbaf's opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 9/11 with a prescient concern for the children of afghanistan ;  and idrissa ouedraogo's amusing children's crusade for osama bin laden--a hunt almost as serious and successful an undertaking as the one for the real osama .  youssef chahine's segment is a noble if failed experiment which at least has the guts to remind the audience that bin laden and al'qaeda are basically creations of american foreign policy and the cia ,  and though sean penn's character study seems out of place ,  it's still an effectively bittersweet piece of film-making .  all in all ,  essential viewing ,  and a darn sight better than oliver stone's reactionary world trade center . 
eleven different film makers from different parts of the world are assembled in this film to present their views and ideas about the wtc attack .  this is one of the best effort you will see in any film .  films like this are rarely made and appreciated .  this film tries to touch every possible core of wtc .  here are some of the most important stories from the film that makes this film so unique .   there is the story from samira makhmalbaf  ( iran )  where somewhere in iran people are preparing for the attacks from america .  there a teacher is trying to educate her students by informing them about innocent people being killed in wtc massacre .  then comes a story from youssef chahine  ( egypt )  where a film maker comes across face-to-face conversation with a dead soldier in the wtc attack and a dead hard core terrorist who was involved in wtc attack .  then we see a story from idrissa ouedraogo  ( burkina faso )  where a group of five innocent children's sees osama bin laden and plans to kidnap him and win the reward money from america .  then we see the story from alejandro gozalez inarritu  ( mexico )  where you see a black screen and slowly you see the real footage of wtc buildings coming down .  and the people who are stuck in the building are jumping out of it to save their lives .  the other most important story is from mira nair  ( india )  where a mother is struggling to get respect for her dead son whose name is falsely trapped in wtc massacre !  after september 11 attack ,  our heart beat automatically starts pumping if we hear two names anywhere in the world .  .  first is world trade centre and the second is osama !  this film totally changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more to it .   i will definitely recommend this movie to everyone who loves to have such kinds of home dvd collection .  definitely worth every penny you spend .  but please don't expect anything more apart from films in this dvd .  there is of course filmographies of the film makers but no extra features . 
i saw this series when it world premiered at the toronto film festival .  i liked the idea behind the film ,  where two men got together and told a director from each country to direct a movie about 911 .  these directors never met before until the project was complete ,  and they saw how it looked all together .  warning :  spoilers ahead !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  all the pieces were very powerful ,  and some were controversial .  if you are an american ,  then you may not like this as some of the pieces may be found anti-american .  however ,  i know a few americans who enjoyed these series .  the piece that i found the best was the one from india .  it was about how a muslim family ,  living in the states ,  had 2 sons ,  and one of them was missing .  the americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was linked with the terrorist bombing .  it captures the mom's despair and humiliation of these accusations so well ,  that it brought tears to my eyes .  in the end we see that her son had died while trying to save the many victims from the crash of the towers .  this was a true story ,  and that was what made it so real .  there were a lot of emotional and powerful pieces ,  and the african piece was one of the best .  it was humourous yet just as powerful as the others .  a must see for everyone ,  and hopefully america will unban this ,  and let it play in their country . 
though the pieces are uneven this collection of 11 short films is truly a moving and human experience .  there were some who ,  in the wake of the emotion on the anniversary of the bombings ,  took this to be anti-american .  i don't think thats the case ,  even though some parts might be taken that way if you don't look behind the obvious .  ultimately the film is nothing except an attempt by people to express their confusion ,  sympathy and feelings about what happened .  these are stories of people who's worlds have been shaken up by what happened on a tuesday in september .   as i said this film will move you ,  probably to tears .  its not always easy to watch ,  for example the film from mexico is little more than a black screen with sound ,  but its effect is such as to lay even the strongest of people low .  if you can be strong you really should see this film .  it will comfort you and enlighten you and affect you .  .  . 
as you may know ,  the subject here was to ask eleven directors from all over the world to make each a short movie of 11 minutes ,  9 seconds and one frame .  we have here  :  - samira makhmalbaf  ( iran )   :  what afghan refugee kids can understand to the towers collapsing  ?  well ,  nothing .  a great lesson .  - claude lelouch  ( france )   :  a weak plot with a great cinematography .  .  .  just imagine a deaf woman living by the wtc who sees without understanding it that her dog barks .  .  .  well just see it .  - youssef chahine  ( egypt )   :  the greatest oriental movie maker has compassion .  .  .  for everyone  :  for an us soldier who died ten years ago ,  for the people in the wtc but also for a palestinian suicide-terrorist .  maybe the less tender movie towards the us .  - danis tanovic  ( bosnia hrzgovia )   :  good images ,  makes us travel ,  for sure .  .  .  not a very good plot .  idrissa oudraogo  ( burkina faso )   :  from one of the poorest country in the world ,  a tender and funny story about five boys who want to capture osama bin laden .  .  .  and they could have done it but nobody believes them when they tell they know where he is .  ken loach  ( uk )   :  september 11 ,  1973 ,  the chile entered in a twenty-years long bloody dictature .  thousands of death ,  tortures  :  all that was offered to chile by henry kissinger and the cia ,  and knowing this changes very much your point of view  !  i guess that is because of that particular short that no american movie distribution company accepted to release the movie in us theaters  !  loach forgot to point that 1973 is also the year when the wtc was built  !  - alejandro gonzalez inarritu  ( mexico )   :  impressing images that we all know too well ,  and a lot of black screens .  i didn't get this one very much ,  it is more an artist video  ( to show in an exhibition )  than a movie .  - amos gitaï  ( israël )   :  an absurd ballet of policemen ,  journalists ,  etc .  ,  around a burning car in jerusalem .  very well done .  - mira nair  ( india )   :  about the anti-islamic feeling that followed september the 11th .  very good actualy .  - sean penn  ( us )   :  a funny little story that reminds us a fact usualy forgotten ,  the wtc did have a huge shadow ,  and some places now have a daylight they never had .  - shohei imamura  ( japan )   :  a different one .  here there is not even one word about the wtc ,  and the action takes place at the end of wwii .  it has only one message  :  no war is holy .  this short movie gives very deep feelings ,  but the director aparently would have done better with more than 11 minutes .  --- so --- a great movie ,  a great attempt to take the world's temperature .  i love it . 
this collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a great idea ,  and presents some great segments ,  but also some disappointing surprises .  based on the tragic event of the september 11th 2001 in the united states of america ,  eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the american tragedy .  the result of most of them is not only an individual sympathy to the american people ,  but mainly to the intolerance in the world with different cultures and people .   ken loach  ( uk )  presents the best segment ,  about the september 11th 1973 in chile ,  when the democratic government of salvador alliende was destroyed by the dictator augusto pinochet with the support of the usa .   the other excellent segments are the one of youssef chahine  ( egypt )  ,  showing the intolerance in the world ,  and the number of victims made by usa governments in different countries along the contemporary history ;  and the one of mira nair  ( india )  ,  showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a pakistanis family ,  whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in usa ,  when he was indeed a hero .   some segments are beautiful :  samira makhmalbaf  ( iran )  shows the innocent afghans refugee children preparing an inoffensive shelter against bombs ,  while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world ;  the romantic claude lelouch  ( france )  shows the life of a couple in new york nearby the wtc ;  danis tanovic  ( bosnia-herzegovina )  shows the effects of their war in a small location and the lonely protest of widows ;  sean penn is very poetic ,  showing that life goes on ;  and shohei imamura's story is probably the most impressive ,  showing that there is no holy war but sadness and disgrace .   the segment of idrissa quedraogo  ( birkina faso )  is very naive ,  but pictures the terrible poor conditions of this african nation .   the segment of amos gital  ( israel )  is very boring and manipulative ,  showing more violence and terrorism .   the segment of alejandro gonzález iñárritu is very disappointing ,  horrible ,  without any inspiration and certainly the worst one .   my vote is seven .   title  ( brazil )  :   " 11 de setembro "   (  " september 11 "  ) 
given the nature and origin of the 11 filmakers it is not surprising that this film is at best neutral in its stance towards america .  probably the most 'anti' segment comes from ken loach who is definitely not towing the british new labour party line .  although those events of a year ago are shocking and painful to most americans and most spectators who saw them unfold live through cnn etc .  the majority of the writers and directors choose to show that tragedy is not an american monopoly .  should anybody be surprised that these 3000 deaths are given the same weight elsewhere as the west gives to thousands tutsi ,  tamil ,  bosnian ,  chilean ,  kurdish  ( need we go on )  victims .  if this was a 'wake-up' call for the states then it is equally tragic that in the subsequent 12 months the israel/palestine impasse is further from a solution while george bush jnr .  would rather wreak revenge than make the world a safer place .  i think many of the contributors wonder where the idealism of the founding fathers went ,  and why america orignally built as a bastion of freedom ,  justice and tolerance now sees its self-interest paramount while the third world wonders where the next drink ,  meal or bullet is coming from . 
french production in which leading film directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of september 11 .   the film segments vary widely in content and quality .  two allude to u . s .  complicity in terrorist acts  ( in chile against allende ,  who died on september 11 ,  1973 ,  depicted in the segment by british director ken loach ;  and in palestine by u . s . -backed israelis ,  shown in the segment from egyptian director youssef chahine )  .  two more recall other destructive acts  ( a palestinian suicide bombing in tel aviv ,  shot by israeli director amos gitan ;  the japanese  " holy war "  against the west in ww ii ,  by shohei imamura )  .   ironies abound in several stories .  shadows that darken the new york city apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the world trade towers telescope to the ground in sean penn's piece ,  bringing the man momentary joy .  but in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone .  in mira nair's film ,  based on a real incident ,  a missing young man ,  also in new york city ,  the son of a pakistani family ,  is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist ,  but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers .   there are poignant moments dotted throughout .  loach has his exiled chilean man quote st .  augustine ,  to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage :  anger at the way things are ,  courage to change them .  imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war .  samira makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young afghan schoolchildren ,  exiled in iran ,  trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in new york .  but they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp ,  where two men have fallen into a deep well ,  one killed ,  the other sustaining a broken leg .  this is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds .    idrissa ouedraogo ,  from burkina faso ,  creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots osama bin laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist ,  in order to get the $25 million u .  s .  reward .  he tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans ,  for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes ,  while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute .   it is mexican director alejandro gonzalez inarritu  ( maker of  " amores perros "  )  who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment ,  one that ,  for the most part ,  shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds .  brief visual flashes gradually permit us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers ,  and it dawns on us that the thuds are these bodies hitting the ground .  the sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a still shot ,  bearing a phrase first shown only in arabic ,  then with a translation added :   " does god's light guide us or blind us ?  "   ( in various languages with english subtitles )  grade :  8/10  ( b+ )  .   ( seen on 10/31/04 )  .  if you'd like to read more of my reviews ,  send me a message for directions to my websites . 
it was clear right from the beginning that 9/11 would inspire about as many films as world war ii and vietnam combined ;  however ,  there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good  ( or rather :  bad )  as pearl harbor .  it is a great luck that the first international release about 9/11 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces ,  but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire world .   i'm not intending to say that all 11 episodes are great  ( youssef chahine's ,  for example ,  has a needless prologue with too many cuts and shohei imamura's has a really bizarre ending )  or that the segments are in the right order  ( imamura's ,  being the only one not referring directly to the twin towers ,  should open the film ,  not end it ,  alejandro gonzales inarritu's should be the last one instead ,  as it's the most impressive one )  .  but it is an impressing effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towers .   consider samira makhmalbaf's opening segment ,  in which an afghan teachers tries to explain to her pupils what happened in new york and unsuccessfully suggests a one-minute silence .  or idrissa ouedraogo's part  ( which features a bin laden-double so much resembling the real one that you'll be shocked when you see him ,  i promise )  ,  in which 5 boys muse about good things that can be done with the reward put out on laden .   there's a surprisingly good  ( and extremely angry )  segment by ken loach about a man from chile talking about what he calls  " our tuesday september 11 "  - that september 11 in 1973 when their elected president allende was killed and pinochet installed his dictatorship - with the generous help from henry kissinger and the cia .  this could have become a terrible effort in anti-americanism ,  but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with inarritu's  ( mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the hijacked planes to a black screen ,  sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the wtc and finally a collapsing tower ,  ending with the screen brightening up and one question appearing )  and amos gitai's about a hysterical reporter trying desperatly to get on air after a car bomb exploded in tel aviv  ( hard to recognize ,  but this one is a masterpiece of choreography )  .   all these different segments  ( i haven't mentioned yet claude lelouch's about a deaf girl ,  danis tanovic's about a demonstration of the women of srebrenica ,  mira nair's - strange ,  but it takes an indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to western tastes - about a muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 9/11 and sean penn's with ernest borgnine  ( yes ,  ernest borgnine )  as a widower leading the most depressive life one can imagine )  add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget .  i am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now .  i hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies .  but ,  alas ,  it's far more probable it will be remembered as a one-film-only effort .  and as the one of the few 9/11 movies made by then that don't reduce this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience . 
 " read my lips "  tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain ,  socially maladroit female office worker  ( devos )  and her workplace trainee ,  a crude excon  ( casel )  .  as the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds ,  each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome .  good stuff for anyone into character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents .  in french with easy to read subtitles and good translation .   ( b+ ) 
this movie is really not all that bad .  but then again ,  this movie genre is right down my alley .  sure ,  the sets are cheap ,  but they really did decent with what they had .    if you like cheap ,  futuristic ,  post-apocalyptic b movies ,  then you'll love this one !  !  i sure did !   
i watched the movie while recovering from major surgery .  while i knew it was only a  " b "  film ,  a space western ,  i loved it .  it may have lacked the flash of high dollar productions it non-the-less held my imagination and provided great escapism .  sadly our society has so much available ,  discounting small attempts is too easy .  in the same way that i can enjoy a even a grade school performance of shakespeare ,  i can appreciate many levels of achievement for the art sake .  i am a cop and found affinity with the retired lapd .  dreams like his haunt me that i will be unable in the moment of crisis be able to respond to save another's life  ( or my own )  .  while it was a romantic ending where farnsworth did take out the bad guy  ( predictable )  i needed a little happy romance where good can triumph .  my world is really too cynical . 
the question is ,  can a movie this entertaining really be considered a  " bad "  movie ?  my husband and i picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words  " vestron pictures "  on it  ( vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since i first acquired the legendary films  " suburbia "  and  " class of 1984 "  )  .  we were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was .  your basic plot as is follows :  grange ,  this goombaesque thug from planet earth ,  robs  " the bank of the moon "  and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet  ( i don't even remember the planet's name )  to mine for bauxite and other minerals .  the  " governor "  of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor .  walker ,  a bounty hunter  ( apparently one of only three on the whole planet )  reminds the prisoners that there is no escape ,  because there's only one shuttle out of the whole planet and they'd have him to deal with .  then there's the nameless  " colonel "  ,  a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare .  much of the movie centers around  " futuristic "  car chases  ( dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides )  with explosions galore .  the planet itself looks suspiciously like hemet ,  ca or one of those other dusty inland empire outposts .  but what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several la punk bands of the mid-80s .  i seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl ,  but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack .  i can't even remember the names of the bands  ( they're listed in the credits )  other than exploding white mice ,  because that was the only one i'd heard of before i saw this movie ,  but i'm definitely looking into them .   basically ,  the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends . 
splendid film that in just eight minutes displays an unusual genre mix :  mystery ,  thriller ,  musical .  briefly ,  we are allowed to tell about the story :  a girl comes into a european cafeteria and then .  .  .  soft transit from nonsense mystery to narrative logic .  in a no time ,  no place way vigalondo managed a delight in b/w by means of imagination and despite  ( thanks to )  the tightest of budgets .   because of the unity of time-space the film reaches the intensity of a short poem  ( almost a haiku )  .  spain ,  land of quick poetry in b/w  ( ¿remember the early buñuel ?  )  .   a must see for reassuring our belief in young cinema outside the states . 
good film .  tells a boyish fantasy story ,  telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently .  or at least the feeling :  that you have to break every rule if you are to break one .  if you wanted to express love for someone you don't know ,  how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation ?  also it's about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life ,  of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats .  what gives disney or fox or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice .  are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self .  do we have to listen to the nrj shouting ,  see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee ? 
a woman ,  mujar  ( marta belengur )  enters a restaurant one morning at & : 35 unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in said restaurant & is making them act out a musical number in this strange yet fascinating short film ,  which i only saw by finding it on the dvd of the director/writer's equally fascinating  " timecrimes "  .  it had a fairly catchy song & it somehow brought a smile to my face despite the somber overall plot to the short .  i'm glad that i stumbled across it  ( wasn't aware it would be an extra when i rented the dvd )  and wouldn't hesitate at all to recommend it to all of my friends .   my grade :  a-
this 2004 oscar nominee is a very short b/w film in spanish .  a young woman goes into a café ,  gets a coffee ,  and notices a couple of musicians standing silently with their instruments .  all the patrons are motionless ,  like mannequins .  one guy ,  however ,  is quite jolly and breaks into a song about what goes on at 7 : 35 in the morning .  there is one surprising moment after another until the end which is quite ,  well ,  surprising .  the people ,  the place ,  everything looks quite ordinary .  and like the musical piece  " bolero "  ,  the thing keeps building until the climax .  with its structure ,  theme , movement and wit , it is an 8 minute masterpiece . 
if you're amused by straight-faced goings-on that are logical within a given illogical situation ,  you'll enjoy this whimsical 8-minute spanish film .   a woman enters a small café .  the scene looks ordinary ,  but the counterman ,  customers ,  and two musicians seem somehow oddly subdued .   suddenly ,  the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song  ,  dancing across table tops with musical-comedy gestures .  the customers ,  at first immobile ,  at intervals chime in  ( badly but gamely )  with phrases from the song ,  read from slips of paper in their palms .  on and off they jump up and dance  ( awkwardly but earnestly )  in choreographed motions ,  like backup singers .   but why ?  ?  ?  the woman wonders .  the answer is revealed as the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what's strapped across his chest -- just before the explosive climax .  .  .   even if you don't catch the song's  ( probably ironical )  lyrics ,  the situation-perfect performances should give you a grin and a chuckle .  .  .  i'd love to see it again ! 
with a minimal budget ,  a running time of eight minutes and a great amount of imagination ,  nacho vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts i've ever seen .  the subtlety of the screenplay is really remarkable ,  since it doesn't give the ending away until the very last moment .   don't let anybody tell you what the short is about ,  since you'll be able to enjoy it a lot more .  nacho vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show :  directing ,  writing and acting in this formidable short is the most remarkable effort i've seen in years .  also pay attention to the performance of marta belenguer ,  her reaction shots are incredible .   overall rating :  8/10
i was so glad i came across this short film .  i'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across ,  so when i saw this and saw that it was nominated for the live action short film at the academy awards ,  i was so pleased that i actually had a film that i was rooting for .   the plot is pretty simple ,  the director ,  writer ,  and star nacho vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals .  the result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy .   it's a well made short film ,  well edited and the actors all do a great job .  and the last shot of the film is perfect .   i highly recommend this film . 
i picked this one up on a whim from the library ,  and was very pleasantly surprised .  lots of tight ,  expressionistic camera work ,  an equally tight script ,  and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film .  not for the reptilian multiplex brain ,  but rather the true aficionado of cinema .  if hollywood ever does get its grimy hands on it ,  i'm sure it will ruin it .  a choice treat all the way around .  other posters here have more than amply sung its praises ,  so i needn't bother duplicating their paeans ;  just take their advice ,  and mine ,  and don't miss this gem .  call it what you like ;  i call it two hours of entertainment well-spent .  read my lips :  don't miss it . 
more directors like nacho vigalondo need a greater outlet for their talents .  7 : 35 de la mañana is absolute genius .  what nacho is able to convey in 8 minutes takes some hollywood directors hours of film to achieve .  i watched this smiling ,  but feeling a little dirty and not in the sexual way .  you sit and wonder how you should feel after watching this 8 min .  nugget .  i was entertained ,  but was disturbed at the same time .  not many people can do that in just 8 minutes .  it starts off simple enough .  a young women comes in for breakfast at her usual place .  she sits down and someone starts singing .  from there ,  the film takes you through so many different emotions all at once it is hard to describe .  it is in black & white ,  but this helps with the feeling the film gives you . this film makes you want to know more about the characters ,  how they interacted previously and how the ending impacted their lives afterward .  i guess it like the old saying ,  " leave them wanting more "  ,  nacho vigalondo is able to do that .  watch this when you can .  show it to your friends and wonder how 8 minutes can be so much fun without taking off your clothes . 
this is a masterpiece footage in b/w 35mm film .  the film makes you see a strange way to begin the day at 7 : 35 am in a bar and how much things can happen there in 8 minutes .   the short amazingly ,  gets you in a complex story using very little elements ,  and step to step makes you realize that something isn't totally right .  it expresses a lot ,  makes your adrenalin go high with subtle details ,  and is incredibly understandable by anyone ,  not just the cinema critics experts .   but i know how it sounds  :  european short ,  black and white and low budgeted .  don't let that scare you .  is really worth to see by anyone ,  not just experts in the genre .   isn't really much more to tell ,  since the film just lasts 8 minutes  ( exactly )  ,  and i don't want to spoil it .  but i just watched it online and i couldn't understand why no one spent a few minutes to post a comment about it .   really worth watching it .  10/10 . 
re :  pro jury  although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful ,  the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story .   one may believe that middle-class teen-age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30-year-old's they barely know ,  but i doubt it .    " easily give away virginity "  ?  what a shrewd remark about this film .  truly .   one may believe that young high school teens are highly self-confident and self-assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations ,  but my experience has been ,  more often than not ,  teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world .   you just aren't at all able to see the world other than through your own eyes ?  that's sad .   one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin -- the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes -- and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake ,  but i think not .    and another  " expert "  opinion drawn from experience .  dandy .   one may believe that 30-something-year-old troublemakers can enter into ,  and hang around inside ,  a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble ,  but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents ,  chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this .   now be a good sport and tell us at which institution you grew up .   one final nit ,  throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome .  there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome ,  but because it was never detailed ,  each reference distracts from each scene .   of course there's probably an explanation .  good job figuring that out !  now i'll be generous and will help you out of your misery :  although it was translated as a general  " foursome "  ,  the word  " &#269 ; etvorka "  has another meaning :  it's a sports term used to designate a 4m or 4w setup - a rowing crew consisting of 5 persons :  4 rowers and a coxswain .   this movie did not ring true for me .   we should all heed to your competent and praiseworthy opinion .  dude . 
 " hey babu riba "  is a film about a young woman ,  mariana  ( nicknamed  " esther "  after a famous american movie star )  ,  and four young men ,  glenn ,  sacha ,  kicha ,  and pop ,  all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 belgrade ,  yugoslavia .  the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz ,  blue jeans ,  or anything american it seems .   the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant ,  and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties .  in the wake of changing communist politics ,  they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985  ( the year before the film was made )  .   i enjoyed the film with some reservations .  the subtitles for one thing were difficult .  especially in the beginning ,  there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all .  perhaps the conversational pace required it ,  but i couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene ,  which caused me to not always understand which character was involved .  i watched the movie  ( a video from our public library )  with a friend ,  and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative .   this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability ,  idealism ,  and strong and loyal bonds to each other .  there is a main flashforward ,  and it was intriguing ,  keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast ,  and what had actually happened .   i would rate it 7 out of 10 ,  and would like to see other films by the director ,  jovan acin  ( 1941-1991 )  . 
i was intrigued by the title ,  so during a small bout of insomnia  ( fueled by my curiosity .  .  .  )  ,  i stayed up and watched it .  i then checked my tv listings and watched it again !  there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film- in spite of politics ,  traditions ,  culture ,  etc .  ,  teenagers everywhere are virtually the same .  the characters of the kids from belgrade could have been transported to ,  let's say ,  somewhere in the american midwest during the same time period ,  and language differences aside ,  would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era .  they certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations ,  politics aside :  music ,  sex ,  movie idols ,  music ,  drinking ,  sports ,  music .  .  .  as a matter of fact ,  much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970's southern california .   this was a bittersweet story ,  but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable .  the characters ,  especially the young actors ,  were completely believable also .  i won't say this was the yugoslav  " american graffiti "  ,  but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50's-themed movies . 
a very well made film set in early '60s communist yugoslavia .  the five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong ,  sincere and emotionally deep performances .  a clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives .  highly recommended . 
a sharp political comment posturing as a coming of age story is what this movie is .  the annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels .  it isn't supposed to but it does .  this tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 communist belgrade is a heart warmer .  it is what gentlemen refer to as classic cinema .  obviously ,  1953 belgrade is not as harsh a dictatorial and fascist environment as the communist society is often portrayed .  one can listen to rock and roll music ,  one of the songs played is the song  " hey babu riba "  ala the title of the movie .  but jeans cannot be bought nor certain drugs which are illegal to possess .  unlike a heavy-handed criticism of a communist society this movie does it by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as we four .  the girl who has a father in exile in italy and is awaiting a passport for her mother and she to travel out to join him ,  the piano that is taken away from communion use from one of the boys ,  the sudden giving of your home and quarters to your new comrades because they need it .  the boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is made clear they despise the fascism that communism has created as they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has stalin tattooed on his hands .  these all leads to the actions they take later on and the remembrance of a time fading away ,  as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the soviet empire .  a great movie worth seeing again and again .   " repentance is not your enemy but yet it is also nobody's friend .  " 
one of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex yu . story is very familiar to people in ex yul because generation after war used to live in the same way . people in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect people . the plot is in the 50 "  , when josip broz tito said no to the sssr and politbiro and because of that our borders becomes open for western influence . but , in a country were people didn't had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was everything . the friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their emigration from yu is still alive . they get together after all this years on ester " s funeral and they start to remember of their childhood , before their went to the emigration and become successful people . 
my personal feeling is that you cannot divorce this movie from its political/historical underpinnings like so many  ( american )  reviewers tend to do .  this is not about growing up on main street ,  usa .  it is about growing up in yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the east and the west .  just like the guys are torn between esther and everybody else ,  and esther is torn between the  " tovarish joe "  and the guys .  there is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under tito .  i feel the movie is under-rated and it is too bad we have lost the director .  movies like this make freedom feel more important .  it is not just  " another eastern european coming of age film "  .  .  . it is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom . 
finally a movie where the audience is kept guessing until the end what will happen .  well ,  we all kind of know that the lives of the brothers ,  andy  ( played by hoffman )  and hank  ( played by hawke )  will spiral downward towards destruction since where else is there to go but down ,  but we do not know how or when until near the end of the movie .  hoffman is superb ,  as usual ,  and even hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since he really cannot think for himself .  hawke might have been a little out of his element ,  but he played the part well enough .  add into this mix andy's wife ,  played perfectly by marisa tomei ,  cheating with hank ;  andy's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addictions ;  and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery .  this movie will get you thinking . 
thank god this wasn't based on a true story ,  because what a story it is .  populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds ,  before the devil is a mesmerizing ,  jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable  ( and sometimes is ,  even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout )  if it weren't carried out with such magnificent ,  overwhelming conviction by its stars .  the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesn't hurt either .   the main dysfunction here is of a family nature ,  with the two majorly screwed up brothers  ( brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke )  deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store ,  an attempt that goes pathetically awry .   the story is told with time-shifts  ( which are noted on screen ,  such as :   " charlie :  two days before the robbery "  ,  so no one should be confused )  ;  some people have said they didn't like this device but i thought it worked perfectly ,  adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair ,  considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life .  throw in these cheesy extra tidbits :  one of the brothers is a drug addict ,  married to gina  ( marisa tomei ,  also excellent )  ,  who is having an affair with the other brother ,  toss in some monumental sibling rivalry ,  along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father  ( a wrenching performance from albert finney )  ,  who has apparently caused him serious past pain ,  and you've got a shakespearean/greek tragedy on your hands .  proceed with caution . 
i settled back to watch  " read my lips ,  "  a plate of freedom fries before me .  the food was quickly forgotten as i became engrossed by director and co-writer jacques audiard's original and superb thriller .   carla  ( emmanuelle devos )  is a secretary at a firm that develops major building projects .  she actually has some significant responsibilities that don't often fall to secretaries and she's capable and ambitious .  and thwarted by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward her .   work piling up faster than she can handle it ,  carla is told to hire a secretary .  enter ex-con and general layabout paul  ( vincent cassel )  .  he lies about his skills and in fact has none that any legitimate enterprise might require .  after an initial serious misunderstanding by paul as to carla's interest in him ,  the two become allies .  a quirky friendship starts .  in a stunt that would have made a real carla a major contender on  " the apprentice ,  "  she trumps her egotistic male adversary at work with paul's connivance .  exit the rival .   carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid .  with it she hears almost normally .  she turns the hearing aid off to isolate herself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people .  she's also very lonely .  a heroic makeup effort was made to have her appear plain but she's truly beautiful .  she hasn't a boyfriend .  she babysits so a friend can have a liaison  ( it is a french movie )  worse and humiliatingly ,  she accedes to a girlfriend's plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in carla's bed .  not nice .   as carla and paul get to know each other better ,  the barely repressed larcenous side of the not so former felon emerges .  there's a side story ,  by the way ,  of paul's relationship with his parole officer which neatly complements the main plot and has its own big surprise ending .    " read my lips ?  "  ingenious paul recognizes that carla's ability to read lips ,  even from a considerable distance ,  is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to be .   from there a caper develops .  enough said .   paul and carla are a true criminal oddball couple .  she wants love but will also accept money .  he wants her ,  sort of ,  but business must come before possible erotic satiation .  together cassel and devos are strong actors carrying an unusual crime tale to its end very convincingly .   rent it or buy it but if you enjoy a good crime story you'll go for  " read my lips .  "  and you may well want to watch it several times :  i do .   9/10
watching before the devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema .  i have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film - and for me ,  the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience .  it is one of those films that has stayed with me ,  and i continue to ponder and think about it .   surely the dvd would illuminate some more of the themes and the film-making elements ?  which include :  sidney lumet's comeback movie ,  the time-shifting technique deployed in the storytelling ,  the superb combination of lumet and masterson and why it works so well ,  the masterly direction ,  the relatively rare focus hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women ,  the under-presented ,  but nevertheless resonant marisa tomei's performance ,  and ,  of course ,  the superb hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the movie .   phew !  surely a masterful film .  so imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated dvd - only to find no commentary ,  no behind-the-scenes ,  no interviews ,  no extras .   hey - distributors - sort it out ! 
'before the devil knows you're dead' is one of the best movies i've seen in a  long time .  the acting from  the excellent ensemble cast is incredible .  philip seymour hoffman putting in an outstanding performance and is electrifying every time he's on screen .  ethan hawke matches him scene for scene and albert finney simply chews up the screen .  marisa tomei is ,  however ,   criminally underused ,  but looks amazing for her 42 years .  the script is excellent ,  the story-line non-linear but easy enough to follow .  sidney lumet ,  although not known for his blockbusters ,  has turned out a gem with this one ! 
this intensely involving 2007 character-driven suspense drama is like a big ,  juicy piece of shakespearean-level steak from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out uncommonly ferocious ,  to-the-edge performances from his actors .  consider for starters - henry fonda's lone dissenting juror in  " twelve angry men "  ,  katharine hepburn's delusional mary tyrone in  " long day's journey into night "  ,  rod steiger's conflicted concentration camp survivor in  " the pawnbroker "  ,  william holden's wintry lion in  " network "  ,  and paul newman's alcoholic lawyer in  " the verdict "  .  the list encompasses some of the finest screen work of the past half-century ,  and you can safely add philip seymour hoffman's desperately controlling andy hanson to the ranks .  at 83 ,  director sidney lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue ,  and in fact ,  he revels in the melodramatic turns of first-time screenwriter kelly masterson's thickly plotted script .   the scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash .  woody allen followed a similar fraternal dynamic in his last film ,  the oddly pinched  " cassandra's dream "  ,  but lumet is neither pinched nor cautious in his fierce approach to this inescapable tale of ambiguity and deception .  the plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless .  embezzling funds from his real estate company's payroll to keep his neglected wife gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit ,  smooth-talking andy is about to be exposed in an irs audit .  meanwhile ,  his younger brother hank is a mass of post-divorce ,  codependent insecurities falling way behind in his alimony and child support payments .   andy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents' suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there .  the goal was for the brothers to collect the haul ,  and the parents to claim the insurance .  murphy's law intervenes in every possible way starting with andy pressuring hank to do the job himself .  after some brotherly cajoling ,  hank agrees to it ,  but too scared to do it alone ,  he recruits a reckless ,  gun-toting busboy to handle the robbery .  by fate ,  the heist occurs on the one day that andy and hank's mother is opening the shop ,  and things quickly spiral out of control from there .  although the back-and-forth storytelling technique is not new  ( for example ,  alejandro gonzález iñárritu's  " 21 grams "  )  ,  masterson's approach works effectively in delineating certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the repercussions of the unfortunate event .   the acting is pitch-perfect starting with hoffman's riveting performance as andy ,  a machiavellian reptile whose cool exterior and innate amorality mask layers of resentment toward his family .  i thought he was great in tamara jenkins'  " the savages "  ,  but he is even better here .  lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually insufferable ethan hawke as hank ,  imbuing him with the emasculated weakness that informs his every ill-planned move .  as their embattled father ,  albert finney acts with his typical late-career bluster ,  but he provides the necessary foundation for the oedipal-level complexities .  marisa tomei is a smart choice to play gina ,  as the actress economically keys in on the responsive ,  watchful nature of a small but pivotal role .  the estimable theater veteran rosemary harris  ( now better known as peter parker's aunt in the  " spider-man "  trilogy )  has precious little time as the mother ,  as does amy ryan as hank's bitter ex-wife .   there are scenes that border on excessive ,  especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers ,  but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable .  after the disappointment of the cartoonish  " find me guilty "  ,  it is refreshing to see lumet in peak form here .  the 2008 dvd offers terrifically informative commentary from lumet ,  hoffman and hawke ,  all of whom converse with ease and insight throughout .  along with the original theatrical trailer ,  there is also a better-than-average 24-minute featurette ,   " directed by sidney lumet :  how the devil was made "  ,  which features on-set footage and snippets of interviews with lumet ,  two of the producers and the principal actors . 
the humor implicit in the complete title proverb derives from the sunday school dictum that one would be better advised to prepare before you're dead for the devil's scrutiny ,  i . e .  so the devil doesn't care when you're dead .  there's no percentage in trying to beat the devil .  the characters apparently didn't pay attention at sunday school ,  and find themselves forced into crisis management ,  having eschewed crisis avoidance .  but even a seasoned ceo would have difficulty managing these crises .  throwing dice is far more unpredictable than flipping a coin ;  when people are involved ,  the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable sidney lumet films .  until now ,  hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor but here perhaps had an eye toward earning billing among other lumet all stars like steiger and pacino . 
this is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong .  a simple robbery .  pick up some serious change .  get our finances together and everything will be hunky-dory .  butmom and pop's jewelry store ?  no problem .  insurance pays for it all .  no guns .  nobody gets hurt .  easy money .   older ,  more successful  ( it would appear )  brother andy  ( philip seymour hoffman )  has a few minor problems .  heroin addiction ,  cocaine habituation .  a wife  ( marisa tomei )  thatwell ,  he can't seem to perform for .  his flat belly days long gone .  younger ,  sweet ,  slightly dim-witted younger brother ,  hank  ( ethan hawke )  with a few dinero problems of his own .  behind in child support payments for his daughter ,  in debt to friends and relatives ,  not exactly wowing them in the work of work ,  etc .   sydney lumet ,  in this performance at the age of 82  (  !  )  ,  directs and gets it 99 . 99 percent right ,  which is hard to do in a thriller .  i have seen more thrillers than i can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes ,  the improbabilities ,  the cheesy scenes ,  and the hurry-up ending .  here lumet makes a thriller like it's a work of art .  every detail is perfect .  the acting is superb .  the plot has no holes .  the story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the bard himself .   hoffman of course is excellent .  when you don't have marquee ,  leading man presence ,  you have to get by on talent ,  workmanship and pure concentration .  ethan hawke ,  who is no stranger to the sweet ,  little guy role ,  adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we don't know whether to pity him or trash him .  albert finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age .  and marisa tomei ,  who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity ,  manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as andy's two timing wife .   ( but who could blame her ?  )  it's almost a movie reviewer's sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars ,  but if you study this film ,  as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do ,  you will notice the kind of excessive  ( according to most hollywood producers )  attention to detail that makes for real art--the sort of thing that only great artists can do ,  and indeed cannot help but do .   ( by the way ,  i think there were twenty producers on this filmwell ,  maybe a dozen ;  check the credits .  )  all i can say in summation is ,  way to go sydney lumet ,  author of a slew of excellent films ,  and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced agekudos .  may we all do half so well .   okay ,  the 00 . 01 percent .  it was unlikely that the father  ( albert finney )  could have followed the cabs that andy took around new york without somehow losing the tail .  this is minor ,  and i wish all thrillers could have so small a blip .  also one wonders why lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of hank at the end .  we can guess and guess .  perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor .  perhaps lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out ,  and he just said ,   " leave it like that .  it really doesn't matter .  "  and i think it doesn't .  what happens to hank is not going to be good .  he isn't the kind of guy who manages to run off to mexico and is able to start a new life .  he is the kind of guy who gets a  " light "  sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasn't really a man when he should have been .   see this for sidney lumet ,  one of hollywood's best ,  director of the pawnbroker  ( 1964 )  ,  the group  ( 1966 )  ,  serpico  ( 1973 )  ,  dog day afternoon  ( 1975 )  ,  network  ( 1976 )  ,  and many more . 
the beginning of this film is a little clunky and also confusing  ,  but sit tight ,  because you are in for the ride of your life .  the concept is compelling ,  with interesting devices utilized to tell the overall story .  there are fine performances all around ,  with phillip seymour hoffman's being the best of the cast-no surprise there .  ethan hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well .  the direction by mr .  lumet is outstanding .  the film has a seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story ,  but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today ,  this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects or product plugs .  you will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film . 
i really enjoyed this drama from sidney lumet .  the best word i could come up to describe it with is insane .  it throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesn't let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end .  trust me ,  this movie will keep you guessing the entire way through .   the story is very well crafted and almost brilliant .  it's almost like a more complicated tarantino type story .  the acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts ,  excellent cast .  i also loved the cinematography ,  it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film .  it was all great .   this movie is excited ,  exhausting and heartbreaking .  it's almost hard to watch but you'll be glad that you did . 
if i watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when i hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie ,  it's got to be pretty good .  i'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist .  i watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end ,  then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death  ( the english patient ,  shakespeare in love ,  atonement ,  crash .  this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end .  acting is great ,  story is absolutely original ,  flash-back technique very affective .  there was a bit of citizen kane thrown in tho when hoffman trashes his apartment after tomei leaves him ,  but i forgive that cause i see it as a homage to ,  rather than a rip-off of ,  orson . 
i watched this film in a very strange way -- i had put it on my netflix list and couldn't remember why  ( other than that i knew philip seymour hoffman was in it )  .  since the film has no opening credits ,  i couldn't even remember who had directed it .   as my wife and i watched it ,  i turned to her about 45 minutes in and said ,   " you know ,  i keep wanting to decide that i hate this film ,  but something about it just won't let me stop watching it .  "  then there's a stretch of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that are truly electrifying in the actors' performances .   it was only as the end credits rolled that i realized it was a sidney lumet film .  and i thought -- wow .  i'm surprised that lumet took on what was really a dirty ,  petty little story about really mean ,  broken people .  but it's a testament to his talent that i was so taken in when i didn't even realize it was him .   philip seymour hoffman is really ,  really good in this movie .  like scary good .  put this up against capote and i would argue the oscar should have been for this film instead .   i also highly recommend the narrative special feature with lumet ,  hawke and hoffman talking about making the movie -- it's entertaining and educational ,  with hawke playing the student eager to learn at the master's feet .  lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors -- kiss their asses constantly !  !   there are a lot of violent ,  melodramatic movies out there that are empty ciphers when all is said and done .  and there is an element of that in this film -- that the actors fill the air with sulphurous blasts of emotion ,  and when the smoke clears there's nothing left .  nothing resonates on a deeper level .   but lumet has given us network and twelve angry men -- films that ,  each in their own ways ,  have been elevated into the highest echelons of cinema .   this movie isn't at that level .  but there's something about it that lingers .  and maybe that's enough .   my final comment is about the comments -- if you look at the number of comments about this little movie here on imdb -- and the depth and intelligence of the comments ,  pro and con -- it's a pretty good indication that something special is going on with this film . 
if you're a fan of film noir and think they don't make 'em like they used to ,  here is your answer -they just don't make 'em in hollywood anymore .  we must turn to the french to remember how satisfying ,  subtle and terrific a well-made film from that genre can be .  read my lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director jacques audiard ,  featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from emmanuelle devos and vincent cassel .   the basic plot could have been written in the 40's :  dumb but appealing ex-con and a smart but dowdy femme fatale  ( who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious )  discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing ,  manipulate each other to meet their own ends ,  develop complex love/hate relationship ,  cook up criminal scheme involving heist ,  double crosses ,  close calls and lots of money .  all action takes place in depressing ,  seedy and/or poorly lit locations .    audiard has fashioned some modern twists ,  of course .  the femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her .  and where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature .  add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film ,  but make no mistake - this is old school film noir .  it's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films i've seen all year . 
the hanson brothers - andy  ( apparently has his act together )  and hank  ( clearly doesn't have his act together )  need money .  andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole hanson family .   this film delivers .  this is a layered ,  full-blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing .  as a crime drama / thriller i would happily compare it to 'no country for old men . ' while both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills ,  'devil' is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace .  'no country' is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire ,  while 'devil' is a bit more enjoyable .  there is definitely less violence in 'devil' than 'no country . ' the acting delivers as well .  ethan hawke ,  sometimes wooden in the past ,  brings the jitters ,  sweating and the deer-in-the-headlights-look to the besieged hank .  philip seymour hoffman ,  as andy ,  has the film's hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor ,  who you believe can do anything .   there's really not much wrong with this film .  it jumps back and forth without being confusing .  events spiral out of control ,  but the film never does - the writing  ( from first timer kelly masterson )  ,  directing  ( veteran sidney lumet )  and the editing stay as tight as a drum .  in many categories ,  this is award caliber stuff ,  though maybe films like 'the departed' and 'no country' squeezed this one out of the limelight .  if you liked those ,  you'll like this . 
legendary director sidney lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense ,  and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children .  with an a-list cast headed by philip seymour hoffman  ( an oscar-worthy performance here )  ,  ethan hawke ,  marisa tomei and albert finney ,  lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as reservoir dogs ,  but also family stories such as ordinary people .   many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot lumet has gone with here .  instead of showing it in a linear manner ,  he has gone the tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order .  i personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next .  the script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife hoffman and tomei ,  as well as between father and son finney and hoffman .  all the actors are totally engaging to watch and lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in .  plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time ,  this is a rare movie that doesn't disappoint for one moment . 
while the title  " before the devil knows you're dead "  comes from an irish proverb the film plays out like a greek tragedy .  it all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess they've gotten themselves into .   the cast is well-assembled with philip seymour hoffman & ethan hawke playing the aforementioned brothers .  notable support includes albert finney as their father and marisa tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other .  beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable .   the story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve .  the narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts .  that being said ,  the film's unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy ,  through and through .  all in all ,  a pretty impressive debut for first-time screenwriter kelly masterson .   sidney lumet's direction is well handled but i'm more impressed by the fact that he's still directing at over eighty years old .  i was less impressed by the score by carter burwell but it isn't a major distraction .   in the end ,  the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story & presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience . 
tarantino once remarked on a melodrama from the 1930s called backstreet that  " tragedy is like another character "  in the film .  the same could be said- and not withstanding bringing up tarantino- for sidney lumet's best work in years ,  a melodrama where character is of the utmost concern not simply because of what's at stake with the cast involved .  kelly masterson doesn't have a masterpiece of a script here  ( it basically breaks into crazy killer mode by the end in a series of climactic events that only work by the very end ,  and even there suspension of disbelief is paramount )  ,  but her script does convey character before plot ,  and in a story where the actions surround a heist it's crucial to know who these people are beat by beat .  it's bleak as hell ,  unforgiving as satan ,  but also absolutely riveting 90% of the time .   chalk it up not just because lumet knows how to handle a non-linear script where we see the day-to-day actions of character to character before during ,  and mostly after the botched 'mom-&-pop' jewelry store robbery occurs ,  but because of the formidable cast assembled  ( which ,  i might add ,  is lumet's specialty )  .  philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke are brothers with their own respective financial f***-ups ,  and the former approaches the latter on what looks like a fool-proof heist :  looting their own mother and father's jewelry store in westchester .  hawke's hank involves another shady character though ,  murders occur ,  and suddenly it's tragedy on a greek scale affecting the brothers and their father ,  played by a perfect albert finney .  it's the kind of material that most actors love- characters who ,  like in dog day afternoon ,  are painfully human ,  flawed to the bone but only wanting love &/or things to be set right ,  and have the complete inability to fulfill their wants and needs .   in this case though hoffman and hawke are matched splendidly ;  hoffman has ,  until the aforementioned last ten minutes ,  a super-calm and occasionally joking demeanor that reveals him as the brains of the operation ,  but then smaller scenes where he breaks down emotionally  ( i . e .  with finney or the car scene with tomei )  push his talents to the limit ;  hawke ,  meanwhile ,  is called a loser by his ex-wife and daughter ,  can't pay any debts at all ,  and is called a baby by his own father ,  and he fills the bill of the part in all the ways that matter- he's not quite as flawed as his older brother ,  but who wants to pick a straw for that title ?  and finney ,  as mentioned ,  is spot-on all the way through ,  making his turn in big fish look like child's play  ( the final scenes with him are terrifyingly tragic ,  his face recoiling in a horror that has built up all through the second half )  .   also featuring supporting turns from a finely ditsy and perversely two-timing marisa tomei ,  bug's michael shannon as bad-ass white trash ,  and amy ryan ,  brian f .  o'byrne and rosemary harris making brief ,  exact impressions ,  this is a film with a tremendous lot of skill and heart- but not a forgiving heart- with a story that doubles back on details not for showy plot devices but to make clear every step of a family's perpetual downward spiral .  if it's not as mind-blowing as serpico or network or the pawnbroker or 12 angry men it comes as close as anything lumet's done since . 
in new york ,  andy hanson  ( philip seymour hoffman )  is an addicted executive of a real estate office that has embezzled a large amount for his addiction and expensive way of life with his wife gina  ( marisa tomei )  .  when an audit is scheduled in his department ,  he becomes desperate for money .  his baby brother hank hanson  ( ethan hawke )  is a complete loser that owes three months of child support to his daughter ,  and is having a love affair with gina every thursday afternoon .  andy plots a heist of the jewelry of their parent in a saturday morning without the use of guns ,  expecting to find an old employee working and without financial damage to his parents ,  since the insurance company would reimburse the loss .  on monday morning ,  we would raise the necessary money he needs to cover his embezzlement .  he invites hank to participate ,  since he is very well known in the mall where the jewelry is located and could be recognized .  however ,  hank yellows and invites the thief bobby lasorda  ( brian f .  o'byrne )  to steal the store ,  but things go wrong when their mother nanette  ( rosemary harris )  comes to work as the substitute for the clerk and bobby brings a hidden gun .  nanette reacts and kills bobby but she is also lethally shot .  after the death of nanette ,  their father charles hanson  ( albert finney )  decides to investigate the robbery with tragic consequences .    " before the devil knows you're dead "  is a comedy of errors ,  disclosing a good story .  the originality and the difference are in the screenplay ,  with a non-linear narrative à la  " pulp fiction "  .  the eighty-three year-old sidney lumet has another great work and it is impressive the longevity of this director .  philip seymour hoffman is awesome in the role of a dysfunctional man with traumatic relationship with his father that feels the world falling apart mostly because of his insecure and clumsy brother .  marisa tomei is still impressively gorgeous and sexy ,  showing a magnificent body .  the violent conclusion shows that the world is indeed an evil place .  my vote is seven .   title  ( brazil )  :   " antes que o diabo saiba que você está morto "   (  " before the devil knows you're dead "  ) 
the bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil .  the love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction .  two brothers ,  andy and hank ,  will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most .   andy hanson  ( philip seymour hoffman )  and his younger brother hank  ( ethan hawke )  couldn't be more different .  andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in new york's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife gina  ( marisa tomei )  who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed .  hank ,  however ,  is divorcée who finds himself at the mercy of his ex-wife ,  his daughter's expensive school bills ,  and endless amount of child support payments .  a man who means well and has good intentions ,  hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it .   however ,  andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better .  he has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears .  the pressure of his life ,  and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up ,  have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with gina in order to start over again .  of course ,  like hank ,  he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it .  how ?  by robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run .  this act of betrayal is where the hanson brothers ,  their families ,  and several other lives ,  will be destroyed because of greed ,  pride ,  and fear .    the uniqueness of before the devil knows you're dead is the manner in which the story is told .  after the robbery goes wrong ,  and nanette hanson  ( rosemary harris )  who is the mother of both andy and hank is killed ,  the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt .  we learn more about the motivations of not only andy and hank but also the reaction to their father charles  ( albert finney )  to the death of his wife .  the relationship between charles and his two sons ,  especially to andy ,  is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men .  nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story .   philip seymour hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in hollywood today by portraying andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also ,  in contradictory way ,  as a man we can sympathize with .  ethan hawke also brings hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left .  andy and hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions .   before the devil knows you're dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face .  more than that ,  our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected .  in what should have been best picture of the year ,  we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives .  in other words ,  there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse .   10/10
sydney lumet ,  although one of the oldest active directors ,  still got game !  a few years ago he shot  " find me guilty "  ,  a proof to everyone that vin diesel can actually act ,  if he gets the opportunity and the right director .  if he had retired after this movie  ( a true masterpiece in my eyes )  ,  no one could have blamed him .  but he's still going strong ,  his next movie already announced for 2009 .   but let's stay with this movie right here .  the cast list is incredible ,  their performance top notch .  the little nuances in their performances ,  the  " real "  dialogue and/or situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing .  the  ( time )  structure of the movie ,  that keeps your toes the whole time ,  blending time-lines so seamlessly ,  that the editing seems natural/flawless .  the story is heightened by that ,  although even in a  " normal "  time structure ,  it would've been at least a good movie  ( drama/thriller )  .  i can only highly recommend it ,  the rest is up to you !   : o ) 
before the devil knows you're dead starts off promisingly ,  setting up a simple heist that goes awry ,  told from varying perspectives  ( in rashomon style )  .  at around the hour mark ,  sidney lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts ;  it eventually morphs into a multi-faceted family drama ,  exploring the full realm of human emotions/relations ,  as the story comes to its chilling climax .   as is the case with lumet ,  he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his star-studded cast ,  without any notion of over-acting or hyperbole .  philip seymour hoffman ,  in one of his best roles ,  is a complex ,  mysterious ,  and interesting character ,  and oftentimes dwarfs ethan hawke ,  who plays his brother ,  hank .  that's not to say that hawke is not bad ;  in fact he is quite above adequate ,  in a troubled role that suits his style .  marisa tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance  ( the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this )  .  albert finney's character  ( andy and hank's father )  is the most intriguing ,  and in my opinion ,  he deserved a bit more screen-time .  amy ryan also performs her job adequately .   before the devil knows you're dead is not an exceptional movie ,  but it proves that lumet is still near the top of his game at the  ( apparent )  twilight of an illustrious career .  many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here ,  not least of which involves the use of his characters .  infused with a killer script  ( no pun intended )  ,  smart dialogue and pacing ,  and a decent score ,  before the devil knows you're dead is a must-see .  a truly underrated gem .  8/10 .  3 stars  ( out of 4 )  .  should just enter my top 250 at 248 .  highly recommended . 
director sidney lumet has made some masterpieces , like network , dog day afternoon or serpico . but , he was not having too much luck on his most recent works . gloria  ( 1999 )  was pathetic and find me guilty was an interesting , but failed experiment . now , lumet brings his best film in decades and , by my point of view , a true masterpiece : before the devil knows you're dead . i think this film is like a rebirth for lumet . this movie has an excellent story which , deeply , has many layers . also , i think the ending of the movie is perfect . the performances are brilliant . philip seymour hoffman brings , as usual , a magnificent performance and he's , no doubt , one of the best actors of our days . ethan hawke is also an excellent actor but he's underrated by my point of view . his performance in here is great . the rest of the cast is also excellent ( specially , the great albert finney )  but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic oscars . the film has a good level of intensity , in part thanks to the performances and , in part , thanks to the brilliant screenplay . before the devil knows you're dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction , a great screenplay and excellent performances . we need more movies like this . 
i must admit that this is the type of film that i would normally eschew ,  but i rented it basically because of the stars .  i certainly was not sorry .  in fact ,  as you see ,  i rated it five stars .  this film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting .   andy and hank hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents' jewelry store .  the crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the hanson family .  through a series of flashbacks ,  we get to know charles hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons .   younger brother ,  hank is basically a screw-up .  he has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind .  hank is insecure ,  cowardly ,  and very much under the influence of his big brother .  ethan hawke has the character of hank  " nailed to a t "  and gives what is probably his best performance thus far .  he shows us a man who is basically good-hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task .   andy - on the surface - appears to be a successful businessman ,  but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit .  it is andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents' store ,  and he gets weak-willed hank to commit the act .  philip seymour hoffman - surely one of the finest actors of our time - plays andy .  hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who ,  on the surface ,  is a charming businessman liked by his acquaintances but a real slime ball underneath .  he is absolutely perfect for the part of andy or it might be said that he ,  through his superior acting skills ,  made andy the perfect part .   albert finney plays a father common to his generation .  charles hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man ,  but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself .  he has always been too quick to criticize and admonish .  he always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional rift between himself and andy .  as we get to know charles and andy ,  the thought of andy forming a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable .   on a personal note ,  i cannot believe how much charles hanson reminded me of my own father ,  and how much andy and hank reminded me of my own brother and myself .  perhaps this may be one of the reasons that i enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant ,  critical father ,  a more successful older brother ,  and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home .  fortunately ,  my brother and i never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents- guess we were made of sterner and more moral stuff .   this complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director ,  sidney lumet .  at eighty-three ,  he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge-of-seat action that hypnotizes .  12 angry men was his first film made fifty years prior to before the devil knows you're dead ,  but he hasn't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered .   the events and characters in before the devil knows you're dead are harsh and unattractive ,  and this is definitely not a feel-good movie .  however ,  it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which i thoroughly recommend . 
i must admit that i had my doubts about this movie before i was going to watch it .  the main reason for that is because it was compared to a hitchcock movie .  i've seen several movies that were said to be inspired by hitchcock or that could have been made by the 'master of suspense' himself ,  but so far i haven't seen any of these movie that would be able to stand the test of time .  in my opinion hitchcock has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some  ( cheap )  thrillers ,  but on the other hand i must admit that i was intrigued by it because this is a european movie .  normally it's the big hollywood studios who like to abuse hitchcock's name if that can raise their income .  but this movie was made in one of the most chauvinistic european countries ever and i'm sure that most french would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an englishman .  that's why i decided to give this movie a try and i must say that i'm glad that i did .    " sur mes lèvres "  or  " read my lips "  as it is called in english ,  tells the story of a young secretary named carla .  she is a hardworking and loyal employee ,  but has never been very appreciated by her colleagues .  that has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing deficiency ,  which has denied her to climb up on the hierarchical ladder of the company .  but when she is allowed to hire a trainee that can work for her ,  all this is about to change .  paul angeli is a 25 year old and completely unskilled ex-convict .  the man is a thief ,  but carla gives him a chance and covers for him when needed .  she hopes to teach him what a regular life should look like ,  but at the same time he drags her with him in his old life .  .  .   since i still believe that the name hitchcock is used too often to describe a very good thriller - which this movie definitely is - i will not make any comparisons between hitchcock and jacques audiard's directing .  fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie .  i hadn't heard of him before ,  but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end .  that also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course .  i doubt if there is someone in hollywood who has ever come up with the idea of using a handicapped woman in a powerful role ,  instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband  ( you know ,  the typical tv-movie story )  .   also worth noticing is the acting in this movie .  vincent cassel is quite famous ,  but emmanuelle devos was a complete mystery to me .  there is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles ,  but they both did an excellent job with their characters ,  making them feel very believable and realistic .  paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and carla the typically helpless woman ,  but thanks to their performances ,  you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it together .   all in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting .  despite the fact that i had my doubts about it ,  i've soon become one of its greatest admirers .  i give this movie an 8/10 .  don't hesitate to give it a try . 
the full title of this film is 'may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead' ,  a rewording of the old irish toast 'may you have food and raiment ,  a soft pillow for your head ;  may you be 40 years in heaven ,  before the devil knows you're dead . ' first time screenwriter kelly masterson  ( with some modifications by director sidney lumet )  has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes .  in this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but ,  here ,  very sensible manipulation of the flashback/flash forward technique of storytelling .  by repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale ,  we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong .    andy hanson  ( philip seymour hoffman )  is a wealthy executive ,  married to an emotionally needy gina  ( marisa tomei )  ,  and addicted to an expensive drug habit .  his life is beginning to crumble and he needs money .  andy's ne're-do well younger brother hank  ( ethan hawke )  is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife martha  ( amy ryan )  ,  is behind in alimony and child support ,  and has borrowed all he can from his friends ,  and he needs money .  andy proposes a low-key robbery of a small mall mom-and-pop jewelry store that promises safe ,  quick cash for both .  the glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men's parents - charles  ( albert finney )  and nanette  ( rosemary harris )  .  andy advances hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that hank will do the actual robbery ,  but though hank agrees to the 'fail-safe' plan ,  he hires a friend to take on the actual job while hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car .  the robbery is horribly botched when nanette ,  filing in for the regular clerk ,  shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess .  the disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when nanette dies ,  charles and andy and hank  ( and their respective partners )  are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn .    each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances ,  and while we have come to expect that from hoffman ,  hawke ,  tomei ,  finney ,  ryan ,  and harris ,  it is the wise hand of direction from sidney lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful .  it is not an easy film to watch ,  but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect ,  a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be .  grady harp
i am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007's films .  if 2004 was the year of the biographies and 2005 was the year of the political films ,  2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales ,  films that portray ,  test ,  challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things .  although this identification is rather broad ,  i think that there are a handful of films released this year ,  such as 3 : 10 to yuma ,  eastern promises ,  american gangster ,  no country for old men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery .  before the devil knows you're dead is a deviously stylish morality tale ,  and quite a dark ,  bleak and depressing one at that .  and even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time ,  the legendary sidney lumet ,  who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thriller .   it's one of those films whose plots are so thick ,  that one is very reluctant to go into details .  it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold ,  as there are twists and turns .  but the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film ;  the true focus is ,  as i mentioned ,  the morality tale ;  the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film .  in a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both the coen brothers  ( namely blood simple and fargo )  and quentin tarantino ,  we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly ,  ridiculously wrong ,  and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy .  and to make it all the more interesting ,  the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time .  sizzling ,  sharp ,  thick and precariously depressing ,  kelly masterson's screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded ,  in particular because it is a debut screenplay .   but the film has much more going for it than just it's delectably sinister and quite depressing plot .  first and foremost ,  the picture looks and feels outstandingly well .  sidney lumet has ,  throughout his career ,  consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting :  naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time .  the film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class ,  with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great .  editing is top-notch ;  combining the sizzling drama-thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly .  and vivid ,  dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style .  the film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by carter burwell .   the screenplay does its part ,  and of course lumet does his part ,  but at the film's dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances .  first and foremost ,  there are the two leads .  leading the pack is philip seymour hoffman ,  who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading-man status after his unnaturally fantastic oscar-winning performance in capote .  his turn in this film is fascinating :  severely flawed ,  broken ,  manic .  hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out ,  and not just his subtlety and wit .  at his side is ethan hawke ,  who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater ,  grander actors .  here ,  he bounces off hoffman and complements him so incredibly well ;  in all ,  the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing ,  the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it's watching actors .  and then there's albert finney .  such a supple ,  opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime .  i love how the dynamics between the three of them play out .  i love how hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they're middle-aged men ;  and yet despite this ,  it is clear how finney's father favours hawke's younger ,  weaker brother .  also on the topic of the cast ,  the two supporting female characters  wives of the brothers  also feature fantastic performances from amy ryan and marisa tomei ,  whose looks just get better and better as the years go by .   this film isn't revolutionary .  these themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of the coen brothers ,  and it's very easy to imagine them directing this film .  but for a film that treads familiar ground ,  it simply excels .  lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to masterson's brilliantly vivid ,  intense ,  and morbidly depressing first-time screenplay .  the lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from hoffman ,  hawke and finney ;  but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a lifetime achievement oscar ,  much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business ,  sidney lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful ,  resonant ,  intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years . 
says andy :   " nobody gets hurt ,  everybody wins .  "  before he says it ,  we know the opposite is true :  everybody gets hurt ,  nobody wins .  this is a new strand in american movies ,  or perhaps an old strand brought back at long last .  think  " eastern promises "  ,   " there will be blood "  ,   " no country for old men "  .  these movies are dark ,  serious ,  extremely well made ,  and don't care about happy endings .  i love them .   " before the devil knows you're dead "  fits the general description ,  but creates an atmosphere all its own .  kelly masterson's debut script is as close as a hollywood movie will ever get to a greek tragedy .  paying tribute to fellow veteran director stanley donen ,  sidney lumet expertly and soberly turns the sombre story into an outstanding ,  old school character drama .  the opening shots ,  although of an obese accountant doggy-styling his trophy wife ,  have the look and feel of a dutch master's painting .  by contrast ,  the drug dealer's condo looks more like a string of mondrians .  great performances all around .  only albert finney's character charles feels a little over-acted ,  eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time .  but then he is in trouble deep ,  deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know .  for compensation ,  marisa tomei is super hot .  but of course you don't need me to tell you that .  why her character gina would want to be with a guy like andy ,  we're never told ,  but that's okay .  action is character ,  after all .  the unique and magic touch of carter burwell's music makes this fine movie a masterpiece .  don't miss it . 
sydney lumet hasn't had a box office hit in 20 years and yet at 83 has managed to churn out a tight ,  well-cast ,  suspenseful thriller set in his old stamping ground ,  new york city .   ( how he got insurance ,  let alone the budget after all those flops ,  is a mystery also )  .  the story is a pretty grim one and the characters are not particularly likable but it held me on the edge of my seat till the final scene .   two brothers with pressing financial problems conspire to rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their elderly parents .  the only victim is going to be the insurance company .  the robbery goes awry and two people die .  most of the film is concerned with the aftermath .  the action is non-linear and seen from the main character's differing points of view ,  but it is not difficult to follow .  what is not so easy to work out is the back story  how did the brothers get into such a mess ?  there are clues  the younger brother being the baby of the family is his fathers' favorite while the older brother seems to be carrying a lot of baggage about his relationship with his father ,  and vice versa ,  but that hardly accounts for him becoming a heroin-using murdering embezzler .   as the scheming older brother ,  a corpulent philip seymour hoffman dominates the film ,  but he is well supported by ethan hawke as his bullied ,  inadequate younger brother .  albert finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that .  marisa tomei as the older brother's cheating wife at the age of 42 puts in the sexiest performance i've seen in many a year .  the film literally starts with a bang ,  but we are out of that comfort zone pretty quickly .   i don't know the origins of this story by first time scriptwriter kelly masterton but i suspect that like lumet's great 70's film  " dog day afternoon "  it is based on fact  it's too silly to be untrue .  lumet is just about the last of those immensely versatile old-time craftsman studio directors who with immense speed were able to direct just about anything that was put in front of them .  some great films were produced that way as well as some classic turkeys .  this isn't a classic of either sort  it's a well-crafted piece of downbeat entertainment .  it will probably leave you feeling that you were lucky not be a member of a family as dysfunctional as this one ,  but still wondering as to how they got that way .  we do know the parents were happy but we see so little of the mother and hear so little about her it is impossible pick up on her relationship with the boys .   ( there is also a daughter whose presence seems redundant )  .  well ,  like tolstoy ,  we have to conclude that  " each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way "  . 
after a cold sex scene ,  between andy and gina ,  in south america ,  we know that andy is a payroll manager who finds himself in a hard economic situation where he badly needs some extra money we also discover that he has been stealing from his job and using the money to his drug habits he's also attempting to keep up with his wife ,  who just might be having an affair   to solve all their problems ,  he persuades his brothera likable loserto join him in a plan to steal their own parent's small store their parents are happily married and proprietors of a jewelry store situated in new york's westchester county sixty thousand dollars is all they'll need to get their life out of desperation   three main characters are important in this movie  first the two brothers each of them is a complex individual ,  threatened with multiple motivations ,  and sunk into doubts and disappointments the two are desperate characters ,  financially and emotionally  andy is selfish he feels that he has never had the love of his father he is the corrupting influence ,  turning his brother into an assailant ,  and his beautiful woman into an adulteress  hank is a puppet too weak to resist his brother's wishes his ex-wife is one of the reasons he needs money as he owes her hundreds in child support .  he longs to regain the confidence he once had with his father   the third character is their weary and deplorable father charles hanson  ( albert finney )  ,  especially in the haunting climactic scenes  telling you more about the details could lessen the impact of the film ,  and therefore the entertainment .  .  .   tomei's performance conveys great depth and emotion even with her look ,  her touch ,  her particular move  lumet's direction is firm ,  fresh and brutal . 
what an extraordinary crime thriller !  !  my wife and i saw this at the toronto international film festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival .  it's already my second favourite film of all-time after dr .  strangelove and i was definitely on an emotional high as i walked home and discussed the film with my wife .   i don't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions .  a synopsis that i'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers ,  played by phillip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke ,  are planning to rob a jewellery store in westchester ,  new york .  the film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time  ( before ,  during and after the robbery )  ,  and one key scene is repeated at least three times .  ordinarily ,  that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece .  the excitement ,  the tension ,  and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed .  by the end ,  i was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up .  i know that i've used a few clichés in this post ,  but i literally was on the edge of my seat .  i should mention that the non-linear storyline is quite easy to follow .  this isn't the sort of movie where you'll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie .   the acting is absolutely brilliant all-around ,  and i doubt i would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadn't been so perfect .  a tiny complaint is that hoffman and hawke don't look like brothers ,  but that's a minor quibble that i can easily overlook .  hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with hawke were positively electric .  marisa tomei  ( as hoffman's wife )  and albert finney  ( as the father of hoffman & hawke )  are also very good in supporting roles .  even some cameo performances were so impressive that i can still remember every remark ,  gesture and facial expression by brian o'byrne and michael shannon  absolute perfection .  the robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene i've ever watched ,  and i had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes ,  especially the ones with hoffman .  the music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie ,  often the same notes played over very effectively .  i had the music playing in my head the following day ,  even as i sat through other films .  in addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph ,  there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable  ( major spoiler ,  so i can't describe the scene )  .  otherwise ,  this film is pretty darn close to perfect .   there were about a dozen great films at the festival that i would enjoy watching a second time but before the devil knows you're dead stands in a league of its own .  as an aside ,  the director sidney lumet spoke before the film and he introduced marisa tomei and ethan hawke onto the stage .  tomei didn't speak and she acted a bit shy so lumet asked  " can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera-shy ?  "  that comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene !  ! 
two dysfunctional brothers  ( philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke )  get tired of competing for who is the bigger f***-up and who daddy  ( albert finney )  loves more ,  so they hatch a hair-brained scheme to rob mommy and daddy's jewelry store so that they can clear their debts and start fresh .  sounds like a great plan except that this is a suspenseful 1970's style melodrama about a heist gone wrong ,  and boy ,  do things really go wrong here for our hapless duo and everyone involved .  lasciviously concocted by screenwriter kelly masterson and classically executed by director sidney lumet ,   " before the devil knows you're dead "  uses the heist as its mcguffin to delve deep into family drama .   contrary to popular belief ,  sidney lumet is not dead .  at age 83 ,  he has apparently made a deal with the devil to deliver one last great film .  lumet was at his zenith in the 1970's with films like  " dog day afternoon ,  "   " serpico ,  "  and one of my favorite films of all time ,   " network "  .  he has somehow managed to make a film that bears all the hallmarks of his classics while intertwining some more modern elements  ( graphic sexuality ,  violence ,  and playing with time-frames and pov's )  into a crackling ,  vibrant ,  lean ,  mean ,  and provocative melodrama .  one can only hope that some of the modern greats  ( like scorsese or spielberg )  who emerged during the same decade lumet was at the top of his game will have this much chutzpah left when they reach that age .   lumet is a master at directing people walking through spaces to create tension and develop characters .  as the cast waltzes through finely appointed manhattan offices and apartments his slowly moving camera creates a palpable sense of anxiety as we never know who might be around the next corner or what this person might do in the next room .  also amazing is how lumet utilizes the multiple pov and shifting time-frame approach .  the coherent and classical presentation he uses makes the similarly structured films of wunderkinds christopher nolan and alejandro gonzalez inarritu seem like amateur hour .   of course ,  what lumet is best at is directing amazing ensemble casts and tricking them into acting within an inch of their lives .  philip seymour hoffman has never been ,  and most likely never will be ,  better than he is here .  albert finney's quietly searing portrayal of a father betrayed and at the end of his rope is a masterpiece to watch unfold .  ethan hawke ,  normally a nondescript pretty boy ,  is perfect as the emotionally crippled younger brother who has skated by far too long on his charms and looks .  the coup-de-grace ,  however ,  is the series of scenes between hoffman and marisa tomei ,  eerily on point as his flighty trophy wife .  lumet runs them through the gamut of emotions that culminate in a scene that is the best of its kind since william holden taunted beatrice straight right into a best supporting actress oscar in  " network .  "    the devil of any great film is in the details ,  from albert finney's tap of his car's trunk that won't close due to a fender bender ,  to the look amy ryan  ( fresh off her amazing turn in  " gone baby gone "  )  gives her ex-husband ethan hawke at his mawkish promise to his little girl all three of them knows he won't keep ,  to the systematic unraveling of a family on the skids ,  to the dialog begging for cultists to quote it  ( my favorite line being the hilariously threatening  " do you mind if i call you chico ?  "  )  to the excellent carter burwell score .   " before the devil knows you're dead "  is the film of the year .  if something emerges to best it ,  then we know a few other deals must've been brokered with old scratch . 
 " cosby ,  "  in my opinion ,  is a must-see cbs hit !  i'm not sure if i've never seen every episode ,  but i still enjoyed it .  it's hard to say which one is my favorite .  also ,  i really loved the theme song .  if you ask me ,  even though i liked everyone ,  it would have been nice if madeline kahn hadn't passed away during the show's run .  since that happened ,  i've always wondered what the show would have been like .  everyone always gave a good performance ,  the production design was spectacular ,  the costumes were well-designed ,  and the writing was always very strong .  in conclusion ,  even though it can be seen on tbs now ,  i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
i sincerely hope that at least the first season of cosby is released on dvd someday .  the episode with hilton's eccentric genius brother ,  george  ( played by the late roscoe lee browne )  ,  is classic hilarity .  it reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up happy .   mr .  cosby and ms .  rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry that they shared on the cosby show for many years and to put them in a more middle-class role shows the dimensions they can take as artists .    the roster of comedic dynamite .  .  . madeline kahn ,  phylicia rashad ,  and mr .  cosby  .  .  . classic genius ! 
i have to say that higher learning is one of the top 3 movies i have ever watched .  it has a brilliant cast ,  and an equally brilliant director .  singleton shows how life in university can be .  there are 3 main story lines ,  the skinheads ,  the african-americans ,  and the homosexuals .  i was intrigued by all of the stories ,  but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about kristen ,  battling her feelings towards another girl .  the end was great .  after seeing the movie 25 times plus ,  i still cry .  i would have given this movie an 11 ,  but i have to settlefor 10/10 . 
this was one of the dvd's i recently bought in a set of six called  " frenchfilm "  to brush up our french before our planned holiday in beautiful provence this year .  so far ,  as well as improving our french we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of french cinema .   what a breath of fresh air to the stale ,  predictable ,  unimaginative ,  crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by hollywood .  what a good example for screenplay writers ,  actors ,  directors and cinematographers to follow .  it was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures .    the other thing i liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end .  is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naïve benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex-con would display ?  will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her ?  the viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other .   once you have seen this film ,  like me you may want to see it again .  i still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look .  the plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office .  you must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place .  but if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of french cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied .  four stars out of five for me . 
in this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot .  it is actually nice to watch because singleton does a great job at presenting the esoteric conflicts and the interpersonal relationships .  this makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for .  in fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap .  definitely not a deep movie  ( even if it wants to be )  ,  but better than an average college movie . 
when john singleton is on ,  he's *on* !  !  and this is one of his better films .  not quite as tight as boyz-n-the-hood ,  but close to it  ( and with much of the same stellar cast )  .  this film was very well written ,  very well put together ,  and very well shot .  there's very little to criticize ,  and most of my complaints are superficial  ( eg :  where did fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff ?  no mention of a rich background .  .  .  and why doesn't professor phibbs have an office ?  a professor of his stature *should* have one .  .  .  and while we're at it ,  for an engineering student ,  hick or not ,  remy's a pretty dumb character - i'd think that he'd have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence - he talks and acts like a total buffoon )  .   but that aside ,  the film was very sharp .  a good array of characters and points of view ;  and singleton doesn't take sides in the story - many of the characters are unsympathetic ,  and he does a good job of interspersing the panthers and supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides .   much of the cinematography was excellent ;  i especially loved the scene where kirsty swanson gets intimate with taryn and wayne each scene spliced together really well .  also the malik/deja scenes were really well shot as well .   the dialogue was a bit much at times ;  this film had a tendency to get *really* preachy at times ,  and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness  ( we really didn't need the us flag with 'unlearn' typed onto it ,  give some credit ,  we're not morons .  .  .  )  .  and to top it off ,  although *most* of the time singleton uses melodrama quite well ,  sometimes it gets *way* too cheezy  ( like deja's death ,  which is fine until she screams out 'why !  !  ! ' which simply ruined the entire effect and scene )  .   but the acting ,  in general ,  was top of the line .  fabulous performances by omar epps  ( perhaps the best i've ever seen )  ,  kirsty swanson  ( who knew buffy could act ?  ?  )  ,  michael rapaport  ( surprised the hell out of me .  .  . after true romance and beautiful girls i though he was a one-role actor )  ,  and of course ice cube and laurence fishburne are *always* outstanding .   downside ?  jennifer connelly was flat ;  though it's not completely her fault :  her role was stereotypical and one-dimensional .  generic to the highest degree .  and tyra banks ,  who had the role ,  was nothing short of horrid .  she whined and whined and whined .  yet another in the long line of models-turned-actresses who failed miserably  ( though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule )  .   finally ,  the soundtrack !  wow !  an amazing soundtrack  ( which is definitely worth buying !  )  which fits the film like a glove .  each scene has a twin song  ( although the tori amos songs started to *really* annoy me by the end .  .  . not her best work )  .  liz phair ,  rage against the machine ,  ice cube .  .  . how can one go wrong ?  ?   all in all :  a really good watch ,  a really strong cast ,  great script ,  great film .  8/10 . 
french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary ,  everyday suburban life .  this was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of l'emploi du temps  (  time out  )   ,  a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker's descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job .  as is the penchant of french filmmakers  ,  many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places ,  giving a cinema verite feel to the story  ,  yet l'emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage  (  most notably a swiss mountain retreat  )  .  running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production ,  jacques audiard's gritty crime caper ,  sur mes levres  (  read my lips  )  .  actually ,  to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that .  as with the earlier french release ,  it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them .  in a paris construction firm carla ,  a shy ,  diminutive young woman sits at her desk ,  sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms .   obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla's desk to chat and drop off their half-finished styrofoam cups of coffee .  partially deaf ,  carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome ,  be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend's baby .  when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load ,  carla fears she may lose her job .  at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant  ( preferably male )  as if she were at a personals agency .  he should be 25 years old and clean -cut  ,  with extensive computer and filing skills .  when the agency sends over an unkempt  ,  menacing looking young man ,  carla is both shocked and intrigued .  they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery ,  where carla interviews her prospective assistant .  when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison  ,  carla initially wants nothing to do with paul ,  but has a change of heart and hires him on .  although she is basically kind toward her helper ,  carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power .  paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker .  carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment .  during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips .  later ,  when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on ,  a furious carla asks paul's help in seeking revenge on the man .  from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years .  the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock ,  most notably rear window ,  where carla's lip-reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars .  there is a teasing ,  on-again ,  off-again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest ,  but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars .  that being said ,  what one carries away from this movie isn't so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers ,  although those elements are definitely there ,  but the pervasive view a of a modern day city  ( in this case paris )  where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy ,  garish nightlife where sex ,  drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters .  unlike hollywood productions ,  this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street ,  where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared .  it's hitchcock with the gloves off . 
this was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues .  it dealt with issues of rascism and class .  but ,  it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself .  this movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny .  it also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society .  what others think of you is not important .  i believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it .  the actors i think were able to convey each character wonderfully .  i just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was .  at a just glancing look you wouldn't see how deep the movie is ,  but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie . 
this is the first movie i've seen of john singleton and he is a pretty good director .  the movie starts out with a bunch of incoming freshman and it shows what happens to several of them .  omar epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and having a hard time keeping up with his work .  he is friends with ice cube and beings dating tyra banks .  kristy swanson is a rich girl who is date raped and becomes friends with jennifer connelly ,  who is a lesbian ,  and isn't sure about which way to go .  michael rapaport is a kid from idaho who falls in with a group of neo-nazis and their leader is cole hauser .  those are the three main characters and laurence fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them .  it's a great film and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts to the movie . 
this movie came and went in the theaters .  due to the nature of it you can see why it wasn't well received .  it was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself .  higher learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in america :  racism .   plot/story :  higher learning is mostly centered around malik ( played by omar epps )  ,  a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough ,  and a stern professor ( played by laurence fishburne )  .  he befriends fudge ( ice cube )  as well as a gorgeous lady named deja ( tyra banks )  .  later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus .  remy ( play by michael rapaport )  is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus .  once they impose their views on him ,  he becomes as racist as they are .   opinion :  higher learning is not without its flaws :  character development is scarce ,  okay performances by omar epps ,  tyra banks and the leader of the skinheads ( whose name i forgot )  ,  busta rhymes doesn't fit in this movie at all .  plus women turning gay after being abused by men was cliché' before this film so you know i didn't like that part of the film with kristy swanson .  other than that ,  this movie wasn't half bad .  laurence fishburne was good as professor phipps ( even though i could do without the accent )  ,  fudge was ice cube's best performance and michael rapaport was good as the confused remy .  all in all it was one of john singleton's best movies and is one is one of the reasons i frown on the rubbish he puts out now .  cinema needs more movies like higher learning ,  mississippi burning and american history x and less movies like baby boy ,  2 fast 2 furious and a very pointless remake of shaft . 
higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us that have been in the closet too long regardless of ethnic background .  it's a subject most of us would like to ignore but we cannot afford to if there is to be a real progressive change in the way we have to be able embrace and understand diversity . some have criticized this film as hateful or dumb but the fact of the matter is ,  ignorance reigns supreme in the world and several continue to help it dominate our society . everyone involved in this film has done a good deed in showing what steps must continue to be done in order to not have to make anymore films like higher learning . sure it sounds like a pipe dream but we have to start somewhere and this helps . 
i enjoyed this movie very much .  kristy swanson omar epps ,  and ice cube were all great in it .  the movie dealt with many issues ,  and i didn't know if i was going to like it ,  but singelton did a terrific job of creating characters that you really cared about . 
omar epps is an outstanding actor .  i really think he gets into his character alot .  when deja gets shot he shows true emotion .  he also shows true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room .  omar is a very talented actor !  ! 
this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in .  john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece .  brilliant performances by the whole cast ,  but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star's career .   however ,  as a college student myself ,  many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme .  in a sense that ,  while they are issues faced on many college campuses ,  they aren't presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe .  in some instances ,  it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur .  however ,  aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic ,  the film was brilliant and left me stunned ,  unable to talk ,  just think .  one of the things from this picture i will remember forever ,  was a quote from lawrence fishburn's character ,   " knowledge is power ,  without knowledge ,  you cannot see your power .  "  brilliant ,  just brilliant . 
this movie had lots of great actors and actresses in it and it addressed some very noble issues .  it's full of emotion and the direction is done well .  the storyline progresses very quickly ,  but i guess that's better than having to watch a 3 hour movie .  this is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy . 
*** spoilers ***   this movie always seems very exaggerated ,  until i remember that my college campus had a former-student-turned-nazi-racist-killer-who-then-committed-suicide ,  too :  his name was benjamin nathaniel smith .   look him up in the wikipedia- i added a few photos to their article about him .   it's hard to believe ,  but this stuff really does happen .   i'm not a big fan of omar epps or ice cube ,  but larry fishburne ,  kristy swanson ,  jennifer connelly & mike rappaport were good . 
of life in  ( some )  colleges .  of course there were artistic licenses taken ,  but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges .   i went to colleges in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own .  it's funny because these are schools that want racial unity ,  equality etc .  and i can honestly say ,  that it's there .  but the thing is when class lets out ,  or when they're just hanging out waiting for class ,  they  ( students )  seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity .  is that bad ?  not really .  everyone needs a feeling of belonging .  but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that ,   " we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them .  "  otherwise you're creating your own segregation .   racism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended .  one time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the aryan race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations .  fortunately ,  nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering .   i can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen .   so is  " higher learning "  overly dramatic ?  exaggerated ?  maybe .  is it way  " off mark ?  "  it depends on where you went to or go to school .  the race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own does happen .  minus the hollywood exaggerations ,  the race thing hit pretty close to home for me . 
first one has to take into account the time period this film was made in .  1995 .  rappers were in it ,  and that added to the flair of it .   remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't ,  until he met and was befriended by nazis .  they took him in .  nazi's aren't all this awkward ,  but like most gangs ,  they fill a void that is missing be it economic ,  social ,  emotional ,  whatever .  michael rappaport played the part perfectly .   omar epps was the hot shot track star ,  with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder .  he kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight ,  and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it .   kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in ,  until she was date raped .  she then found her self experiment with her sexuality ,  and getting involved politically .   this film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism ,  people's own perspectives come into play .   i read so many comments about how there were no 'evil' black characters but there were evil white one  ( nazis )  .  so what ?  remy wasn't portrayed as evil at all ,  he was trying to find his way ,  and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him .  he was scared ,  it was sad to see him devolve how he did .  he even says right before he kills himself ,  i didn't mean it ,  i wanted to be an engineer .   ice cube and busta rhymes were angry black men ,  ice cube was somewhat of an intellectual ,  and busta rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug .  they both showed no consideration at all for their roommates ,  and generally appear to not like white people very much .  they were angry like the nazis but not on the level of nazis in terms of overall badness .  sorry if this makes it seem unfair ,  but are there really black groups like the nazis ?  no .   people say it shows white=-bad black=good .  not true ,  the only bad white characters were the nazis and the police ,  which is more or less true in real life .  kristen was a good girl ,  her boyfriend  ( omar epps roommate )  was a good guy ,  and even remy was a good guy ,  he was just misguided .   omar epps ,  ice cube and busta were seriously flawed characters ,  angry and inconsiderate .  although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger .  remy's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well .   good movie ,  well done .  like all movies that deal with racism ,  its a great piece to get a discussion going .   i don't think cube and busta coulda beat those nazis though . 
john singleton's finest film ,  before blockbuster wannabees like the shaft remake ,  this is a thought-provoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the stories 3 main characters ,  each with identifiable youngster problems .   what i liked about it most is that it also covers the problem of selfpity among young blacks ,  a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films who mostly focus on social-economical problems and racism by whites .  this movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist .   the masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow .  it's not just about racism ,  but about how hard it can be to adopt to a new world  ( college )  ,  date rape ,  discovering sexuality and isolation .  omar epps ,  michael rapaport and kristy swanson each deliver fine performances ,  and the supporting cast is equally interesting with jennifer connelly as a lez  ( yay )  and with ice cube and busta rhymes as college bums causing little riots .   the only negative is the caricature of a professor by laurence fishburne  (  " peppermint ?  "  )  .  surely ,  plenty of professors are nutty .  but they're not as flat .  the skinheads are also a bit of a caricature ,  but i guess they are like that too in real life .   overall a great underrated piece of filmwork ,  if you liked american history x you'll love this one .   8 , 5 out of 10
the film's design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country  ( u . s .  )  .  we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film .  befittingly ,  the obvious of student v . s .  teacher is present .  but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships :  male v . s .  female ,  white v . s .  black ,  and the individual v . s .  society .  but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v . s .  himself .    i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus .  most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other .  this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides .  it did not attempt to show how either was right ,  although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive  ( quite obvious towards the end )  .  the film also discusses sex and rape .  it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together ,  for a time .  lawrence fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps .  he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive .  other stars that make this film are omar epps ,  ice cube ,  and jennifer connelly .  michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance .  tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act .   higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper .  in fact ,  i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other ,  rather than some dry book ,  as the real education at a university .  it is a life-learning process ,  not a textual one .  i think you'll find  " higher learning "  is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general .  8/10
i really enjoyed the 60's .  not being of that generation  ( i'm waiting for  " the 80's "  )  it was interesting to see a unique four hour capsule for that era .   one major problem in the movie ,  however ,  was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of the families .  according to promos i saw for the movie on nbc ,  the story was basically about two families struggling with issues in 1960's america .  now ,  i may have missed something ,  but i think we learned more about the white family than the african american family .   i really think that the 60's uses music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the actors  ( all of which are very talented .  )  this is very visible at the end of the first part  ( about two hours in )  of the mini-series .   very good movie ! 
sometimes you have to look back to go forward .  the 60's did just that .  we need to remember the past .  the past is part of the future .   great mix gary j .  coppola .  i see a great future .  you deserve to be nominated and win ,  the 60's best mixer of the year .   best mini-series of all times .   thanks ursula  
i wasn't alive in the 60's ,  so i can't guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period ,  but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience .  there are some excellent performances ,  most notably by josh hamilton  ( of with honors )  ,  jerry o'connell  ( sliders )  ,  who play brothers divided by the war .  bill smitrovich ,  a character actor who has been long ignored by many ,  gives a heart-filled performance as their strict father ,  who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to vietnam but returns empty inside ,  while the other is exactly the opposite .  all in all ,  this is a powerful and heartwarming film that i hope everyone gets a chance to experience . 
as i saw the movie i was really shocked to see what the 60's was about .  i know i may be wrong about some things ,  but it seemed like the 60's really had an effect on people of the time .  some people said they would want to go back to the 60's .  from what i saw i would say yes for the excitement and no for the outcome .  but that's my opinion . 
this movie started slowly ,  then gained momentum towards the middle .  however ,  the fact that the movie ran over two nights broke that momentum at its peak .  the second part really got interesting ,  but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending .  playing football in the yard ?  really ,  could it get any more sappy and maudlin ?  now i hear plans for a similar movie based on the '70s .  i won't make any great efforts to tune into that one if it's anything like  " the '60s .  " 
one of the better kung fu movies ,  but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews .  the movie starts out well enough ,  with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier  ( which is rarer than you'd think for this era )  and make the non-fight dialogue sequences passable  ( for a kung fu movie ,  this is a great compliment )  .  unlike other chinese action movies ,  which were always period pieces or  ( in the wake of jackie chan's police story i )  cop dramas ,  pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china .  unfortunately ,  in the latter 1/3 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary .   the action is overall good ,  featuring a duel between sammo and 1/2 of the shaw brothers' only 2 stars ,  kar-leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li's bad guy .  there's only 20 minutes of combat here ,  which is standard ,  but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames .  i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other ,  but there are smooth edits and then there's this .  it really takes away from the fights when it's this obvious the footage was messed with .   that said ,  if you like kung fu movies ,  my opinion here won't dissuade you ,  and if you don't ,  you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this . 
i lived during those times and i think the program caught the heart of the era .  i do think it should have dealt with more of the afro american issue but i think it cover a lot in the program .  it was scary to sit and watch the riots on t v hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down .  i thought jerry o'connell did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war .  i went to school with guys who came back .  some had changed more than others and some not so much .  it bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough .  live through it and then make comments .  i thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job .  thank you for a trip  ( sad and good )  down memory lane . 
well let me go say this because i love history and i know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and julia stiles became my #1 favorite actress after seeing her in  " the '60s "  and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history !  !  !  ! 
this is one of the best hong kong  ( action )  films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes .  this sammo film has it all ,  romance ,  drama ,  excitement and a great hero as well .  it is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights .  sammo fans- this is a must see  ( see also eastern condors ,  shanghai express  ( yuen biao is ace !  )  ,  dragons forever and enter the fat dragon . 
i can agree with other comments that there wasn't an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasn't a documentary !  it was meant to entertain and i think it did a very good job at it .   i agree with the black family .  the scenes with them seemed out of place .  like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but i did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty good .   despite it wasn't a re-enactment of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade .  i found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch . 
great ,  great ,  great !  that is all i can say about that movie ,  but imdb want at least four lines of text so i'll elaborate .  the cast was great  ( jerry o'connel is soooo cute !  )  ,  the music was great  ( the sixties had the best music ever ,  imho )  ,  the historical material was interesting ,  and so was the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s .  and most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes ,  and that is the greatness of any drama .  but in one word :  great ! 
the 60´s is a well balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot .  in four deliveries ,  we follow a north american family ,  with 3 members .  but we don't only see them .  we also follow the story of several characters as a black reverend ,  an extremist student leader ,  and a soldier in vietnam .  the filmography is just extraordinary .  in the first chapters ,  we see some shots of the vietnam war ,  in between the scenes .  the next chapter ,  doesn't start where the last one finished ,  it starts some time after ,  giving us a little mystery on what happened .  in general ,  the 60´s mini series ,  is a must see ,  not only for hippies fanatics ,  but for everyone with little curiosity about the topic . 
i love the movie .  it brought me back to the best time of my life .    we need that time again ,  now more than ever .  for me it was a time of freedom ,  learning ,  and finding myself .  i will always miss it .  there will never be another time like the 60's ,  unfortunately . 
i accidently felt on this movie on tv ,  and i wasn't able to leave it .  .  .  .  it's really an excellent movie which makes people learning about american's history with the vietnam war ,  the flower power's time ,  the racism's fight .  .  .  .  it illustrates the conflict of generation ,  of political opinion ,  of race which took place in the 60's .  .  .  . i'm born in 1980 so i didn't know all that stuff before .  .  . in france ,  usa's history is not a priority and that movie really learned me a lot of facts  !  by the way ,  i think all the actors are great ;  especially jordana brewster ,  josh hamilton and jerry o'connell .  now i can see this film more then 1 time each day  !  !  it's really great .  .  .  .  what a shame it only appeared on tv not in cinemas .  .  .   
can any one help find out the title and artist of the song ,  that was played at least halfway through the movie .  i can't remember what scene was playing .  the words in the song are of a ballad .  some of the lyrics go like  "  it's natures way of telling you somethings wrong .  "  it's natures way of telling it in a song .  "   " it's natures way of forgiving you .  "  please help me with this question .  thanks so much !  i have been searching the internet for days ,  i can't get this song out of my mind .  so now this will challenge me to find some one out there who may be able to help mer with this matter .  i wish i would of been paying attention to the scene ,  when it was playing . 
me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something trashy and not so demanding to watch .  however the movie greatly exceeded my very low expectations .   it is so much more than just a representation of a century .  it has very real portrayals of the characters within it and most of the actors do an amazing job .  the different stories are baked together with actual footage from the time that gives it a very unique touch .  while watching it i really felt that i cared about what happened to the characters .   i would also like to give endless amounts of praise to julia stiles in her portrayal of katie ,  she was great in a way that stood out !   i would recommend this movie to anyone .  . 
the 60's is a great movie ( i saw it completely in one night )  about the hippy movement in the late 60's .  although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 60's are not really important in this film .   the main character of the movie is michael , a political activist who goes on the road in the us against the vietnam-war .  there he meets his girlfriend , sarah . michael's brother , brian , goes to vietnam to fight ( what a surprise !  )  . he comes back from the war and changes in a  " tom cruise born on the fourth of july "  look a like and then into a hippy . his dad is a pro-vietnam war type of guy ( what a surprise !  !  )  . michael's sister kate gets pregnant from a rock & roll artist and runs away from home and goes to san francisco during the summer of love .  the ending is very poor ( father becomes a liberal and everybody is happy )  , but i let this slip away from my vote ( the rest of the movie is very good !  )  .    the performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant .  all the main events of the sixties are in the movie , like the murders on jfk and martin luther king aswell as the big hippy protests , the summer of love and woodstock !  look closely for wavy " woodstock speaker " gravy ( what we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400 . 000 !  )  as a first aid employee at the woodstock festival !   in the end , the 60's is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade !  10/10
what the movie the 60s really represents  ( to those of us who growled around in the belly of america in those times )  is the turbulence and diversity of the decade .  despite the exaggerated ,  stereotyped characters ,  the genuineness of the issues remains clear .   not only were those radical times of change ,  but also very confusing times .  two basic things changed our world then :  the 1964 civil rights act ,  and the overwhelming influence of the media .  those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized .   from chaos came sensitivity ,  from disorder came values .  bear in mind however ,  that the bulk of americans were not involved in this .  .  .  they worked ,  they played ,  they watched the news .  .  .  and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities .  .  .  the civil rights workers ,  the political activists ,  the anti-war efforts ,  the war on poverty .  .  .  .   the representation of the power of the press and tv in particular ,  was well reflected ,  although the conflict between the general public's attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored .  .  .  and at worst ,  misrepresented .  .  middle class americans weren't all standing around angrily holding baseball bats ,  or disowning their wayward daughters .  they were confused too .  let us not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers ,  and how the beatles began an onslaught that killed the folk-protest movement .  there are no beatle songs in the movie ,  or even any mention of them .   i think if you didn't live the decade ,  you might not have a sense of what the movie is about ,  the overall picture is a bit dim .  at one point i held down a steady job while my sister lived at the hog farm commune and went to woodstock .  at another point i was in haight asbury and in the detroit riots while she worked and played the housewife in maine and connecticut .  roles were constantly changing .   the movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family .  they represent the hippie child ,  the political activist ,  and the active military personnel .  dad represents the typical attitudes ,  and mom represents the voice of reason ,  tolerance ,  and sometimes compromise .  .  .  for the sake of peace .   the black family comprises a minister and his son .  .  .  disproportionately ,  i think .  i assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations ,  or else the film would have become a long ,  boring ,  documentary .  dad's message was that anger produces bitterness ,  and bitterness produces chaos .  it was clearly a message directed to today's youth .   we are looking at a unique solution to social problems ,  and also how issues divide us .  .  .  the 60s were unusual in that way ,  and only the roaring 20s compare .  in other words ,  this movie has a moral after all .  in the end ,  it is our collective individualism that survives .  put that in your oxymoron list .   everyone was a god ,  a guru ,  or a free-spirited genius in the 60s .  it was a time of magic and madness .  no one will ever nail the 60s down right .  .  .  it was too diverse  ( this movie is close )  .  at least we can say we are not ashamed of it ,  that we learned and grew from it ,  and that for once ,  a generation shaped and changed america .  .  .  for the better . 
this was one of the best movies i have seen .  the movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a major part .  although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget ,  i found it to be exhilarating to watch .   some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction .  however ,  when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters ,  there is no direction is life .  i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptations .   most of the cast are newcomers to the industry .  however ,  they all pulled it off very well .  everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately .   i think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control .  this movie might just scare them enough to change their ways . 
this is an awesome classic monster flick from the 50's !  i just love the look of the 50's in general like the cars and the music .  anyway ,  i love the way the blob looks .  i love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party .  another thing i love about it is that it takes place all in one night ,  just like halloween ii .   when steve and jane are making out ,  they see a meteor fall from space .  inside the meteor is the blob .  whenever the blob consumes a person ,  it grows bigger and bigger .  they try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster ,  but no one believes them until later .  can anything stop this blobby creature ?  i highly recommend the blob !  !  ! 
 " the blob "  qualifies as a cult sci-fi film not only because it launched 27-year old steve mcqueen on a trajectory to superstardom ,  but also because it exploited the popular themes both of alien invasion and teenage delinquency that were inseparable in the 1950s .  interestingly ,  nobody in the kay linaker & theodore simonson screenplay ever refers to the amorphous ,  scarlet-red protoplasm that plummeted to earth in a meteor and menaced everybody in the small town of downingtown pennsylvania on a friday night as  " the blob .  "  steve mcqueen won the role of josh randall ,  the old west bounty hunter in  " wanted :  dead or alive ,  "  after producer dick powell saw this paramount pictures' release .  meanwhile mcqueen's attractive girlfriend aneta corsaut went on to star opposite andy griffith in  " the andy griffith show "  as sheriff taylor's school teacher girlfriend helen crump .  of course ,  neither mcqueen nor corsaut were teenagers ,  but then rarely did actual teenagers play actual teenagers .  director irvin s .  yeaworth ,  jr .  ,  made his directorial debut with  " the blob .  "  linaker & simonson's screenplay synthesized four genres :  first ,  the alien invasion ;  second ,  teenage delinquency ;  third ,  a murder mystery ,  and fourth ;  a horror chiller .  moreover ,  while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes ,  it remains largely anonymous .  in other words ,  the eponymous jell-o neither talks nor communicates by telepathy .  instead ,  it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody .  the tone of  " the blob "  is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy nature .   as the filmmakers point out on the criterion dvd release of  " the blob ,  "  the movie opens uncharacteristically for a sci-fi horror thriller with our hero and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing .  jane  ( anita corsaut )  and steve  ( steve mcqueen )  see a large meteor fall to the earth and drive off to find it .  meanwhile ,  an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick .  the meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick .  when the old timer  ( olin howland of  " the paleface "  )  gets a closer look at it ,  the goop attaches itself to his hand .  the old guy runs screaming from the crater and steve nearly hits him with his jalopy .  steve and jane pick the guy up and take him to see dr .  hallen in town .    hallen is poised to leave town for a medical conference when steve and jane bring the old guy to his office .  hallen phones his nurse to return since he may need to perform an amputation .  of course ,  hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man's forearm .  hallen sends steve and jane to find out what happened .  our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule steve's fast driving .  steve fools him into a reverse drive race ,  but the local police chief dave  ( earl rowe )  lets him off the hook .  steve and the teenagers visit the site of the meteor crater and find the warm remains of the meteor .  after they visit the old man's house and rescue a dog ,  the teenagers split for a spooky late night movie while steve and jane return to dr .  hallen's office .  during the interim ,  the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer ,  killed hallen's nurse and attacked the doctor .  neither acid thrown on the protoplasm nor hallen's shotgun have any effect on the blob .  steve catches a glimpse of the blob absorbing hallen .  when steve and jane go to the police department to report the incident ,  dave is frankly incredulous ,  while sergeant bert  ( john benson )  believes that it is a prank .  bert has an axe to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her car .   steve and jane take them to hallen's office ,  but they can find neither hide nor hair of anybody ,  but dave admits that the office has been vandalized .  against sgt .  bert's advice ,  dave turns the teens over to their respective parents .  no sooner have steve and jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they venture out again .  they drive into town and spot the old man's dog that got away from them in front of a supermarket .  when they go to retrieve the mutt ,  steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the grocery store and it opens .  they find nobody inside ,  but they encounter the blob .  steve and jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob doesn't attack them .  later ,  after they escape ,  steve persuades the teenagers that challenged him in a street race to alert the authorities because he is supposed to be home in bed .  police chief dave and the fire department arrive at the supermarket .  steve tries to convince dave that the blob is in the store .  about that time ,  the blob kills the theater projectionist and attacks the moviegoers .  suddenly ,  a horde of people exit the theater and dave believes steve .  steve and jane wind up at a lunch counter that the blob attacks .  the proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back off .   the authorities collect every fire extinguisher in town and manage to freeze the blob .  the pentagon sends down a team to transport the blob to the north pole .  as the remains of the blob drift down to the polar ice pack ,  the end credit appears with a ghostly giant question mark .  producer james b .  harris obtained stock military footage of a globe master military transport plane depositing the parachute and its cargo .    " the blob "  proved to be a drive-in hit and steve mcqueen's surge to stardom gave the film added momentum .  unless you are a juvenile ,  this little horror movie isn't scary at all ,  but yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of paranoia and sympathy for our heroes .  they never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination ,  so  " the blob "  isn't without a modicum of subtlety . 
i would imagine that if steve mcqueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start  " wanted :  dead of alive "  the same year this film came out ,  or be in the magnificent seven two years later ,  he would not have done it .  but he did ,  and we are the richer for it .   sure it's a camp classic .  horror the way it was meant to be for the drive-in theater .  it's fun and nostalgic .   it is interesting that the last lines of the film were :   lieutenant dave :  at least we've got it stopped .  steve andrews :  yeah ,  as long as the arctic stays cold .    they never would have imagined 52 years ago that the arctic would be thawing .  the blob will soon return . 
sure ,  it's a 50's drive-in special ,  but don't let that fool you .  in my little book ,  there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dollops of humor .  catch the redoubtable mrs .  porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place .  she not only steals the scene ,  but darn near the whole movie .  and where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color ,  a wise decision ,  since the blob would not show up well in b&w .  yes ,  the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate .  but except for several of the teens ,  the non-hollywood cast performs well .  then too ,  the byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining .  pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage .  apparently ,  they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with  " juvenile delinquents "  .  then again ,  the 27-year old mcqueen hardly qualifies in the age department ,  but manages the hot-rodder attitude anyway .  the movie was a hit at the time ,  helped along ,  no doubt ,  by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play .  and except for the unfortunate final effects ,  the movie is still a lot of fun ,  drive-in or no drive-in .  meanwhile ,  i'm awaiting the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into ,  shall we say ,  refrigerator water . 
i had first watched this several years ago on a now-defunct sicilian tv channel ;  amazingly ,  the film emerged as a heftily-priced dvd from criterion :  not being sure what i had made of it initially  ( despite having attained cult status over the years ,  the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs )  ,  i opted not to make the purchase  as i did with the similar and ,  to me ,  unfamiliar fiend without a face  ( 1958 )  .  recently ,  however ,  i managed to acquire the blob via a copy of the spanish dvd which ,  interestingly ,  ported over the two audio commentary tracks from the criterion  " special edition " but ,  regrettably ,  i could not switch off the spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature !  anyway ,  looking at the film anew ,  i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it  ( despite many a narrative flaw ,  which i will get to later )   as a pure example of 'b-movie' schlockiness  ( atypically shot in pleasant color )  and a time-capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes .  the male lead was an early role for steve ( n )  mcqueen and ,  though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain ,  his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging :  not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent  ( and ,  more importantly ,  altruistic )  kid .  the special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period ;  the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monster's invasion of a cinema  ( showing daughter of horror [1953/7] as i mentioned recently in that film's review but being curiously screened 'flipped' and which sequence ,  incidentally ,  would be featured at the opening of a satirical italian program actually called  " blob "  !  )  .  as to the admittedly minor quibbles i have with the film :  the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places ,  never being seen by anyone !  ;  there is a baffling over-emphasis  ( tantamount to padding )  on the kids' scrapes with police ;  it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at the blob  as if fluid ,  whatever its proportion ,  can be destroyed by bullets !  ;  equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits  ( especially when considering that ,  at that stage ,  only mcqueen had actually seen the monster in action )  !  an inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called beware the blob !  ;  the original was then remade in 1988  i watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me  ( though i know micheal elliott loves it )  .  for the record ,  i will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director yeaworth and producer jack h .  harris ,  namely 4d man  ( 1959 )  and dinosaurus !   ( 1960 )  . 
old horror movies are interesting ,  plenty of screams ,  plenty of shouts ,  and plenty of humor to go along with it .   " the blob "  is a classic in it's own work .  steve mcqueen ( 1930-80 )  plays a teen who tries to be a hero in his town .  going out on a date with his girl is rather typical for all teens .  but when the old man discovers the same falling object form the sky ,  he ends up being the victim ,  and steve helps him out the best he can .  when its up to teen power ,  this movie really provides it .  i know most teens have had their hardships when they act up ,  when danger comes around ,  they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity .  when the adults in town ended up learn the hard way about  " the blob "  running amok ,  they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get the better of them .  the oozing juggernaut was rather cute in the day ,  and in my opinion i think it was jell-o !  when everyone pitches in to stop the menace ,  the town is once again safe ,  thanks to good old cooperation .  i still eat jello and watch this movie all the time ,  if you don't like jello ,  tough !  rating 5 stars
some of those guys that watch films and complain about them for a living are forgetting something :  dvd menu system .  i tell you the people ,  i watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times .  it was awesome .  a cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that had me from where it was ,  which was the very beginning .  many times the sum and bam !  i was hooked .  over and over and over .  and over .    " doot de doot ,  de doo de dodedo .  "  and that's just the soundtrack !    i is laid aside in the bed ,  curled up with my vaio .  the rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft is again soft .  the cat is comfortable and my ankle which crosses in me ,  is already rested .  i popped in the dvd .  i was mesmerized .  through the night .   " doot de doot ,  de doo de dodedo .  "   the blob .  see it .  steve queen ,  two cops ,  and one girl in a dress .  two thumbs way up ! 
i saw this movie at midnight on on demand the other night ,  not knowing what to expect .  i had heard of this movie ,  but never really any opinions on it .   i have to say ,  i was impressed with what i saw .  i was genuinely freaked out in some parts and i definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few times .   the blob was scary looking .  now ,  i look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it'll latch itself onto my hand .   steve mcqueen was really good as steve andrews ,  the protagonist of the film .  i also liked the old man in the beginning .   for a 50's horror movie ,  this was very well done even by today's standards .   8/10 . 
first off ,  i hadn't seen  " the blob "  since i was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience .  pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today .  and even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s  " fear of teenagers "  .  but this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be .   sure ,  it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world .  but  " the blob "  packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults don't believe them .  in fact ,  there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy-colored world .  and steve mcqueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him .   to sum up ,  if you can take off your postmodern irony filter ,  there's a lot more to love here than meets the eye . 
this is a pretty well known one so i won't get too deep into it .  the basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor .  human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid .  it also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger .  nobody believes the teens  ( steeve mcqueen and his girlfriend )  and when they finally do it seems that the blob can't be stopped .  it's really well done for it's age and unlike a lot of other 50's flicks the pace is pretty fast .  the story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci-fi and monster movies .  if you can dig the gooey gore of 80s horror be sure to check out the remake from '88 as well . 
this is one excellent sammo hung movie .  actually ,  this is a great piece of hong kong action cinema .  the story tells the story of pedicab drivers in macao looking for love and getting mixed up w/ a vicious pimp .  the performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and well-defined .  the story is involving and has enough romance ,  drama ,  comedy ,  and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes .  sammo hung proves here that he's probably the best fight choreographer in the business .  the action is simply amazing ,  esp .  the fight w/ lau kar leung and the finale .  billy chow and sammo hung are amazing .  a must see for any fan of action . 
most of the atomic age monster movies i saw on television as a kid- and some of them ,  the blob included ,  scared the daylights outta me .  movies like invaders from mars made it all too clear to us  " small fry "  that kids just weren't to be trusted when it came to things like things invading the homeworld ;  the blob just reiterated that fact .  i recall ,  fondly ,  late evenings spent stretched on the floor watching as body snatchers and martian invaders and blobs seeped into an unsuspecting society .  there was a summer ,  in the early 1980s ,  when a local science museum  ( in richmond ,  virginia )  ran an atomic age classic every weekend .  these were 16mm films ,  and most were black and white  ( and the projector was noisy )  ,  and the  " color "  print of the blob had faded to a faint pink- but ,  man ,  was it fun .  i dragged my mother along ,  and she enjoyed it as much as i did .  it was there ,  at that science museum ,  that i truly fell in love with the blob .  the filmmaker's intent was ,  of course ,  to make money- but it was the sincerity of all involved ,  from the filmmakers to the  " talent "   ( the players )  ,  that made me fall in love with this movie .  corny ?  you bet .  cheesy ?  they don't get any cheesier .  but ,  man ,  what a movie ! 
what can i add that the previous comments haven't already said .  this is a great film and the light sabre duel star wars tribute has to be seen to be believed !  !  there are moments of genius throughout this movie ,  if you can ,  see it now !  thanks again to rick baker who gave me this movie many years ago ! 
i've seen the blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion movies from the 1950's .   a strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate this .  a strange jelly like substance then attaches itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land arrive in time and take him to the local doctor's ,  where the old man then gets completely absorbed by the mass .  the doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger .  when these incidents are reported to the police ,  they don't believe the young couple and accuse them of making all this up .  they finally believe them when the mass ,  now huge turns up in the town's cinema and everybody runs into the streets screaming .  it then attaches itself on a diner with the young couple and some others inside .  the blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers at it and it freezes ,  which is its weakness .  it is then transported by plane to the frozen wastes of the arctic and disposed of there .  but it is only frozen ,  not dead .  .  .   this movie has a typical setting for its period :  teenagers and a small town .  the blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout .   the sequel ,  beware !  the blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988 but this is the best of the blob movies .   the cast is lead by steve mcqueen  ( the great escape ) and is the movie that made him a star and aneta corsaut plays his girlfriend .  i'm not familiar with any of the other stars .   the blob is a must see for all sci-fi fans .  fantastic .   rating :  4 stars out of 5 . 
i have read many comments on this site criticizing the blob for being cheesy and or campy .  the movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects .  what would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget ,  locally produced  ( valley forge pa )  christian shorts .  let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious .  that fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits .  for what it was meant to be ,  this film is excellent .  i have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts ,  blair witch project was one of them ,  that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot .  bwp was pure excrement .  the blob ,  on the other hand ,  was well thought out ,  well scripted ,  and thoroughly entertaining .  the scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy .  the scene in the doctor's office with the blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece .  bottom line is ,  i love this movie .  i challenge anyone out there to take $120 , 000 . 00 ,  inflated for today's dollar value ,  and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the blob .  it just can't be done .  period !    thank you for taking time to read this review . 
this is my favorite classic .  it was filmed a little west of philadelphia ,  pa when i was 13 ,  in 1957 ,  and released the next year .  then in 1970 ,  i found myself working the very same county as a rookie pa state trooper .  i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed .  i knew the owner of the downingtown diner well ,  and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the  " home of the blob "  .  the theater scene was in phoenixville ,  near valley forge park and it is still showing films today ! 
i grew up in royersford ,  pa .  the town where jerry's market was .  i remember my whole family going out to watch the filming .  i remember a guy showing the  " blob "  to me and my brothers in a bucket .  i also would like to share that my mother was in the movie .  her hair style was the same as aneta corsaut's and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with steve mcqueen for some shots from behind .  they payed her $25 . 00 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past august .  my mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister . 
the blob is a great horror movie ,  not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable ,  flesh-dissolving title character ,  but because it features a real societal message .  it is ,  in many ways ,  a  " feel-good horror film .  "  the clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast .  the two romantic leads ,  steve mcqueen and aneta corsaut ,  bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings .  they are misunderstood but very well-meaning young people ,  and it's very easy to root for them .   this is a pro-society movie ,  and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom ,  not out of some malevolent character flaw .  steve mcqueen's drag-racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings ,  but quickly joins in mcqueen's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees mcqueen's seriousness .  in this way ,  a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism .   the authorities' initial skepticism of the kids' wild claims is proved wrong--and once the threat is acknowledged by all ,  all conflict within the society disappears .  this unification of purpose ,  and the validation of the  " troublemaking "  teens ,  becomes official when aneta corsaut's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the blob .  on any other day ,  breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent--on this particular day ,  it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure .  at this turning point ,  it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old .   this is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a  " generation gap "  but suggests that it is more imaginary than real ,  and that given a real crisis ,  people will naturally band together to restore order .   " the blob "  is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of  " night of the living dead "   ( 1968 )  .   much has been made of the film's cheap but innovative  ( and effective !  )  visual effects .  they are undeniably clever .  a lot of the gravity-defying tricks we see the blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated .  the camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly  " locked down "  position  ( the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that )  .  these scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned--the silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up .  in a way ,  this was similar to stop motion photography ,  but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet .  even today ,  the effects are startling and bizarre .   a very good film with an exploitative-sounding title ,  the blob is a must-see . 
absolutely the very first film that scared me to death .  i happened catch it when my older brother ( r . i . p .  )  was watching it .  it was on a black and white tv and not really a good picture but it got me interested .  shortly after ,  my folks bought a color set and ,  as luck would have it ,  the million dollar movie was showing it one sunday .   i had forgotten most of the plot ,  but it did not take long to catch up .  .  . and i got so scared i had a hard time sleeping that night !  i mean sure it was just a movie but it involved a creature that not only came from space ,  but you could not hear it ,  or see it .  .  . and once it got hold of you it was too late .  even now ,  after all this time it still sends a shiver up my spine .  a true classic ,  and even better a classic that i have seen scare the pants off a new generation !   long live the blob ! 
a meteorite falls in the country of a small town ,  bringing a jelly creature .  an old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand ,  and the youths steve andrews  ( steve mcqueen )  and his girlfriend jane martin  ( aneta corsaut )  take him to dr .  t .  hallen  ( steven chase )  .  the local doctor treats carefully the blister ,  and asks steve to investigate the location where they found the old man .  when steve returns ,  he sees the blob killing the doctor .  steve and jane try to warn the police and the dwellers ,  but nobody believe on them ,  while the blob engulfs many people ,  getting bigger and bigger .    " the blob "  is a cult and classic sci-fi .  it is a low budget movie ,  with many ham actors and actresses  ( with the exception of steve mcqueen )  ,  awful effects ,  but also delightful and very ,  but very funny .  this is the first time that i see this classic  ( i had seen the 1988 remake with kevin dillon )  ,  and i really recommend it to fans of steve mcqueen and sci-fi b-movies from the 50s .  the film subject of my review number 1 , 400 could not be better .  my vote is seven .   title  ( brazil )  :   " a bolha "   (  " the blob "  ) 
no hidden agenda .  pure scifi .  all fun .   i saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad .  i was a kid  :  )   the original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten .  the original one ,  starring the great movie star steve mcqueen  ( bullet )  ,  is by far the better and only version anyone should see .   the movie production is dated ,  but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time .  i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord .  10/10  -zafoid
who would think andy griffith's  " helen crump "   ( aneta corsaut )  had a steve mcqueen movie in her past ?  but that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers-battle-creatures movie ,  which might best be described as rebel without a cause meets god knows what from outer space .  the rebel is steven mcqueen  ( who would shortly decide that  " steve "  sounded less prissy )  ,  a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting ;  the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned aneta corsaut .  it was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-rodders ,  but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous ,  man-eating what is it that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor--and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left .  but will the grown ups believe them ?  of course not ,  what do they know ,  they're just kids !   the movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best .  the actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously ,  with many a soulful look into each other eyes ,  and the  " adult "  supporting cast probably says  " kids !  "  very third sentence or so .  but the real pleasure of the film its creature ,  which is well imagined ,  well-executed ,  and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense .  and although clearly on the cheap side  ( check out those miniature sets ,  guys !  )  ,  the blob is actually a fairly well-made film--and there's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure .  the 40-plus crowd  ( myself included )  will enjoy the movie as nostalgia ,  but that won't prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole-milk-and-white-bread 1950s sensibility ,  and the film would be a great choice for either family-movie night or a more sophisticated  " grown ups only "  get together .  make plenty of jello cubes for movie snacking !  gary f .  taylor ,  aka gft ,  amazon reviewer
i wasn't aware of steve mcqueen in 1958 .  i only knew that i was extremely frightened about going to see this film .   ( i'd been devastated by the movie  " trantula "  at age seven  .   .   .  but i was ten now )  .  the 1st scene where the blob crawls up the farmer's probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater .  but i stayed and suffered through each of our monster's attacks .  i felt such horror when steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor's office  ( poor doc )  ,  and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience  .   .   .  so many in fact that it oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors ,  too huge now to fit through just one .  it seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential ,  and when it trapped poor steve in a sieve-like diner ,  he seemed like a sure dinner to be .    to say that the blob was cold would be a modern day description ,  but in the end ,  better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kids .   i remember walking home that evening with my uncle nick ,  trying to act brave .  he knew i was in trouble ,  and when i got into bed that night i could not only feel the blob in the room ,  but when i summoned up the courage to look down at the floor ,  there the red pulsating ,  heart-like hungry dude sat ,  waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom .  it took months to recover .    i'm 57 years old now  .   .   .  i've made it .   of course the blob wasn't destroyed . 
sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything .  great story ,  great fights ,  great characters and great cameos .   this film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat .  sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino ,  sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in .   some great and touching moments in the film ,  lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off - gutted .   the end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button ,  as its one of the best end fights i've seen .  sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow . 
i look at this page ,  and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic .  sure ,  i agree to let everyone have their opinion ,  but here's mine :   this movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher ,  and should be seen many casual viewers around the world .  sure ,  it has lost some of it's flair and greatness with age ,  especially in todays world of cgi effects ,  but that's not why you should like it .   you should like it because it actually is a scary movie ,  even for today's standards .  it's overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences ,  so don't slam a classic if you haven't given it a chance .  watch it ,  but not with a critical attitude .  watch it to have fun ,  how it was originally intended . 
the only notable thing about this film is that it was steve mcqueen's first big starring role .   mcqueen's talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci-fi horror piece .  steve shows himself as the anti-establishment ,  hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence .   later on ,  mcqueen would say he hated this film and that  " he was the blob "  .  but everyone has to start somewhere and the blob is cute ,  fresh and innocent .  would that we all had stayed that way .   the plot is fast paced and although predictable ,  still an entertaining hour or so .  and it's really fun to see steve mcqueen before he became the king of kool  ( and anita corsaut before she became andy taylor's girlfriend )  .  a close friend sent me the dvd a while back and it's a treasured addition to my steve mcqueen film collection . 
the blob is a classic 1950s b-movie sci-fi flick .  you probably know the story :  two teens  ( steve mcqueen & aneta corsaut )  see a meteorite hit the ground ,  and when they go to look for it ,  they run into an old man with some weird .  .  . blob attached to his arm .  they take him to the doctor's office ,  and then go to find out what happened .  from there ,  the blob spreads ,  eating everyone in its path .  the special effects are cheesy fun ,  as is the story .  there are a lot of great touches ,  like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district .  it's no masterpiece ,  but it has a special place in its genre .  steve mcqueen is very good .  8/10 . 
this movie is wonderful .  what separates it from other 50's sci-fi is the fact that the alien has no features ,  no face ,  eyes ,  anything ,  yet it can't be killed .  i especially like the idea that this film doesn't take place over a few days ,  it takes place in one night ,  lasting supposedly past midnight . it's also scary that once the blob gets on you ,  you can't get it off .  you're stuck in it ,  as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body .  my all time favorite 50's sci-fi film ,  and what is sometimes considered the quintessential one .  i can see why this rocketed steve mcqueen to stardom .  all this and a catchy theme song !  how can you go wrong ? 
this movie is of almost generation-defining importance to some of us born in the early post-war years in that  ( and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie house )  you almost certainly saw it .  and the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you .  it's style is the stuff of a brief and somehow gloriously exciting moment in our growing up days .    it had a modern ,  space-age storyboard for the audiences of it's time .  the set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a friday midnight show .  it has hot rods and rebellious youth ,  but in the 'why can't they let us have fun' way rather than the disturbed ,  histrionic rebel-without-a-cause way .  all characters were identifiable to us - teens ,  parents ,  the old man ,  the doctor ,  the nurse ,  the mechanic ,  the boy ,  the puppy ,  even the cops - were sympathetic to us .  we could relate to them all  it had a singularly horrifying monster .  it's first victim is heard moaning 'it hurts .  .  .  .  . it hurts' and we were convinced and frightened .  the menace grows continually throughout the story .  there are intense periods of suspense ,  colourful effects ,  a fabulous lead in mcqueen ,  and moments of humour ,  both intended and not .  it even had an almost over-the-top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying .   i saw it in summer ,  age 9 or so ,  double billed with 'i married a monster from outer space' ,  and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that i went back a couple more times before it left .  everyone i knew saw it .  everyone i knew loved it . 
i don't think anyone besides terrence malick and maybe tran anh hung makes cinema on a purer level than claire denis .  that said ,  i don't love this ,  her newest film ,  quite as much as her 2001 masterpiece  " trouble every day "   ( although it comes very close )  ,  which itself is one of my absolute favorite films .  it it only because the narrative here is possibly slightly too elliptical for it's own good .  don't get me wrong ,  the fact that this film barely has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it ,  but i think denis took it about one degree farther than it needed to go and consequently the film does flirt with incomprehensibility ,  and a few key plot points should have been clarified somehow  ( like that the main character goes to south korea to get his heart transplant ,  instead of just showing him there all of a sudden without any explanation of where he is or why he is there )  .  also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for denis to use actors she likes yet again  ( beatrice dalle's character in particular is a little distracting because you keep expecting that she is going to have some significance )  .  still ,  the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is beyond amazing .  it is definitely very much a masterpiece in it's own way .  at least as good as denis' more highly-acclaimed  " beau travail "  ,  if not better .  claire denis has to be my favorite french director at this point ,  better than leos carax even .  also i have to admit that the south korean sequence really does do  " lost in translation "  better than that film itself does  ( and i ,  unlike some ,  am a huge fan of that film as well )  . 
clair denis again revisits her theme of estranged fathers ,  men who follow their own bliss in determined fashion ,  heedless of the emotion toll on their family but while nénette and boni from the earlier film live in a narrow world of marseilles ,  our examination of louis trebor in the intruder takes us from a remote location along the french-swiss border to half way around the world ,  to korea and tahiti .  again the film begins in mid stream ,  with louis ,  in his sixties ,  coping with an ailing heart while attempting to maintain a high level of fitness .  we learn that louis is no stranger to violence as his cabin is the location for smuggling and gunfire a regular occurrence .  louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with rifles nearby .  denis is in no hurry to move the action along ,  and we must patiently build our understanding of louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the frontier including a son ,  sidney  ( grégoire colin ,  almost unrecognizable with long hair and a wisp of a mustache )  who rejects him as a  " lunatic "  :  ,  shown as a dedicated father of two .  there are many brief scenes which ,  while seemingly unrelated ,  build up an impression of louis and his milieu .  ms godard's camera work is exhilarating here .  the controlling metaphor is louis's heart transplant for which he goes to korea and then to tahiti to search for another son ,  not found ,  and where louis's new heart rejects him just as sidney rejected the old .  we are accustomed to brief scenes in denis's film which are inexplicable :  nénette astride boni feeding with a spoon ;  a drive by shooting of boni's father and then the briefest of images of boni with a gunshot wound in the head ;  a scene of louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant but the body of sidney .  the implication ,  of the last two ,  is a rejection ,  real or imagined ,  by a father ,  kills something indefinable in a son . 
films such as chocolat ,  beau travail ,  and others have propelled french director claire denis into the top echelon of the world's most unique and accomplished filmmakers and her 2004 film the intruder  ( l'intrus )  adds to the depth of her portfolio .  a cinematic poem that conveys a mood of abiding loneliness and loss ,  the film provides a glimpse into the psyche of a man who is deteriorating physically and mentally and who travels to various parts of the globe seeking redemption and peace but finds it hard to come by .  loosely based on jean-luc nancy's memoir of a heart transplant ,  the intruder is a film of such unrelenting opaqueness that even after two viewings it is difficult to describe it in other than subjective ,  impressionistic terms .   louis trebor  ( michael subor )  is a man in his seventies who is likely dying of a heart condition and who ,  like the professor in ingmar bergman's wild strawberries ,  attempts to come to terms with the mistakes of his life while he has time .  it is clear that he is physically rugged and very wealthy but seems emotionally drained and the look on his face is one of quiet resignation .  though we see only one episode of violence ,  where he gets out of bed in the middle of night to kill an intruder ,  there is a sinister sense about him .  he might be an intelligence officer ,  a foreign agent ,  or a hit man .   whatever the case ,  he apparently is under some kind of surveillance and acts like a man that has been involved in criminal wrongdoing and is only now able to see the consequences .  facial close-ups throughout the movie create a strong sense of isolation .  he lives with his dogs in a cabin in the jura mountains near the french-swiss border and has an estranged son sidney  ( gregoire collin )  whom he has long neglected .  sidney lives nearby with his wife antoinette  ( florence loiret-caille )  and their two children .  in one telling scene ,  he meets up with his father on the street and calls him a lunatic ,  but that does not prevent him from taking his money .   when the film opens ,  we meet antoinette ,  a swiss border guard ,  who boards a van with a trained dog to sniff out some contraband .  when she comes home ,  she is greeted by her husband who asks her with tongue-in-cheek if she has  " anything to declare ?  "  other than these three individuals ,  the people and circumstances we see during the rest of the film may exist only in louis' imagination .  louis has three women in his life and we meet them all in the film's first half hour :  a pharmacist  ( bambou )  who prepares his medication ,  a neighbor  ( béatrice dalle )  who is a dog breeder who refuses to care for his dogs when he goes away on a trip telling him that they are as crazy as he is ,  and a young russian organ dealer  ( katia golubeva )  who he tells he wants a  " young man's heart "  .   relentlessly ,  she stalks him throughout the film but it is apparently only in his mind .  in the last section of the film ,  louis travels to south korea in search of a heart transplant and to tahiti to deliver a gift to a different son ,  one whom he has not seen for many years or perhaps has never seen .  his heart transplant ,  however ,  appears to be a metaphor for a man without a heart ,  a man whose life has been fascinating but ultimately directionless ,  intruding into other people's lives with little real empathy .  the intruder contains a haunting guitar soundtrack by stuart staples of the band tindersticks ,  reminiscent of the guitar riff in jim jarmusch's dead man ,  and gorgeous cinematography by denis regular agnes godard .   godard creates memorable images that convey a mood of longing and regret :  a heart beating alone in the snow ,  an infant in a sling looking up at his father for a good two minutes ,  the baby's expression gradually turning from morose to a half smile ,  colored streamers blowing from a newly christened ship ,  a massage in a dark room by a mysterious korean masseuse ,  and the vast expanse of ocean seen from a bobbing ship deck .  while the intruder can be frustrating because of its elliptical nature ,  denis forces us to respond out of our own experience ,  to understand the images on the screen on a very personal level .  if there is any theme ,  a hint might be found in the opening that tells us what is revealed piecemeal in the film -  " your worst enemies are hiding ,  in the shadow ,  in your heart .  " 
first of all ,  i liked very much the central idea of locating the '' intruders'' ,  others in the fragile self ,  on various levels - mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical .  in fact the intruders are omnipresent throughout the film  :  in the swiss-french border where the pretagonist leads secluded life ;  in the his recurring daydream and nightmare ;  inside his ailing body after heart transplantation .  .  .  .  in the last half of the film ,  he becomes intruder himself ,  returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past .    the overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic ,  full of regrets and guilts ,  sense of failure being more or less dominant .  this is a quite grim picture of an old age ,  ostensibly self-dependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside .  the directer composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings .  some of them are mesmerizing ,  not devoid of humor though ,  kind of absurdist play only somnambulist can visualize . 
my take on this ,  at our local festival where people would see me so often they thought me a better source than i may actually have been ,  began with a head shake :   " well ,  i can't summarize the plot ,  but it's a really superb character study of an extremely scary man .  "  then ,  slight embarrassment ,  i ran into someone who actually knew what had gone down ,  that is ,  from whom trebor unwittingly gets his new heart .  it'd been my last film in a long ,  long day halfway through the festival .  maybe i'd dozed .  the better a film is the more likely it triggers daydreams that send me really dreaming .  don't know .  did know there was an o'henry twist achingly just beyond my ken as things finished .  and knew it had to do with the heart ,  hence the quietly hilarious talent search .  my plot-loss remark had more to do with intricacies of trebor's connections in france ,  his relation to the dog woman and so on ,  stuff i'd been wide awake for .  denis barely glances at details that might have anchored another director's treatment .   but i write these things too often from memory ,  especially festival films ,  films whose dvd i don't have at hand  ( le lait de la tendresse humaine is one of many examples .  )  ,  and plot kinks fade much more quickly than broader impressions .  still ,  or already ,  l'inrus in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of dark-side superman ,  a super fiend not ensconced in genre or historical trappings but active and plausible ,  relatively soft-spoken ,  driven but patient ,  right among us .  the scar ,  once he attains it ,  makes him ,  just visually i mean ,  in image ,  a sort of hybrid frankenstein monster ,  mad doctor and creation all in one .  the actual doctors are his tools .  if he doesn't extract and install the heart himself ,  it's only because it's not possible .  he's the force ,  always ,  the parasite consuming everyone he touches and finally himself .  what else is he ?  to suggest that he's us ,  the first world versus the third ,  seems too simple since he feeds no less on his fellow first worlders ,  on all of us .   denis's camera's eye - when it looks at things i know - goes usually where mine would ,  so i tend to trust her when she looks at things i don't know .  snow trekking ,  too-fast bicycling ,  and forest darkness i've known in small ways ,  but the south seas not at all ,  so i made better entry into l'intrus ,  both france and the crystalline isles of its finish ,  than into beau travail .  l'intrus is ,  for me ,  a very comfortable discomforting film .  it's a sequence of places portrayed familiarly ,  with a intimacy that allows us to know them whether we've seen the reality or not .  a single image ,  trebor cycling ,  his massive weight on the thin racing frame ,  the sounds of violated air and shrieking tires ,  the asphalt ribbon ,  the dark-in-bright-sun evergreens ,  cued me that the film would be linear ,  a road trip ,  a single will-driven thrust .   despite trebor's personal power ,  he's a human failure .  no matter who he's with ,  he's alone ,  though apparently he hasn't always been .  his body aborts life twice ,  first to need the new heart ,  then despite it .  l'intrus is tragedy .  trebor is hubris .   i'm navigating perilously the thread of what i remember .  let's leave it at that . 
the intruder  ( l'intrus )  ,  a film directed by french director clair denis ,  is the liberation of film .  it follows its own spirit across time ,  space ,  and character .  there may be a plot ,  but what i understood of that i picked up from the description on the netflix dvd sleeve .  honestly ,  it's probably better to know nothing about the film before watching it ,  because then the viewer can set aside any and all expectations .  the film demands that the viewer think ,  but also taunts the fact that he or she will not gain full understanding .   the human heart is the film's enigma .  every image questions its role ,  its nature ,  and its form .  the heart is the intruder ,  that of the viewer and that of louis .  louis' character is played by michel subor with the peace and mystery required by such a character .  honestly ,  anyone could've played louis' character ,  if he or she possessed a wandering ,  willing ,  and comfortable heart .  yet subor is the one featured here ;  he becomes the film ,  his identity is inseparable from it .  many of the film's images lingering in my mind revolve around his expressions ,  vocal but mainly physical .   the intruder is poetic in its ability to capture the stillness and fullness of movement ,  but more fluid than any literature in the shape it refuses to take .   " surrealistic "  has been a term used in describing this film ,  but perhaps  " quasirealistic "  is a more adequate term .  nothing in the film exists outside of the possibilities of reality ;  the simple omnipresent score confirms that by imagining in music the connection between heartbeat and dim light .   watch the trailer a few times if you're attracted to visual imagery ;  see the film to see the consequences of the combination of verse and a grasping for freedom . 
the film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense .  it doesn't present a series of pretty pictures .  instead it is a visually interesting film .  it forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the various shots .  this sort of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed at .  the film refuses to use the crutch of a genre to help the less than fully engaged viewer get what's going on .  instead the film touches on and moves through a number of different genres .  the trick to loving the film is being able to enjoy this playfulness .  i suspect 99% of north american viewers will just not get it .  if you try to pin down the narrative of this film ,  or the philosophical message ,  or the symbolist structure ,  etc .  you will waste your time .  there are none of these .  the film only feints towards these genres and others at times .  the only unifying force in the film is claire denis's own sense of what fits together .  there are so few feature length films that come close to satisfying kant's description of what art is ,  namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself instead of simply subsuming experiences under concepts .  film usually takes the easy way out and opts for the simpler pleasure of understanding what's happening .  most film is not art .  most film doesn't come close to art .  when a film does ,  as this one does ,  and is still enjoyable by a large range of viewers ,  it's something of a miracle .  my on negative comment is that at times i find the film too simplistically buying in to the various narrative threads that run through it .  the tahiti father-son narrative ,  even though it's not exactly conventional ,  ends up making things a little to clear and simple .  it dominates too much . 
claire denis has demonstrated repeatedly that film does not need to tell a story ,  that it is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will .   ostensibly the idea within the framework of a most non-linear film is the older man living on the french-swiss border ,  a man devoted to his dogs ,  who still has a lover ,  but whose cardiac status increasingly threatens his life .  he has a son with a little family who infrequently meet with him ,  but when he discovers he is in need of a heart transplant he opts for going to tahiti via japan to obtain a heart transplant on the black market and to rekindle a long lost relationship with a son he had form a tahitian women years ago .   what denis does with this outline of a story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul ,  the vastness of nature ,  man's interaction with people vs animals ,  etc .  much of the time the 'film' doesn't make sense ,  but that is because we try too hard to connect all the dots laid out before us in beautiful pictures .  life is sort of like that :  we look ,  see ,  observe ,  integrate ,  process ,  and make of it what we will .   in using this form of film making  ( much as she did in the strangely beautiful 'beau travail' )  claire denis has developed a signature technique .  whether or not the viewer finds the finished product rewarding has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information .  this is an interesting and visually captivating film ,  but many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little .  perhaps watching again will change that .  grady harp
two things haunt you throughout l'intrus  ( the intruder )  :  who's the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you're watching ?  the ending is so shocking that for a while you're at a loss for an answer to either of those questions .  the intruder pops up as different characters ,  different men in different circumstances who don't belong in the scene ,  so they're expelled from it ,  kindly or brutally ,  but often without emotional involvement .  the main character ,  louis ,  is a contemptible man .  he's got rough ways ,  some mean job and no heart .  he needs one and goes after it .  he has a heart transplanted and afterwards decides to start a new life .  can this man succeed in his quest for redemption ?  a guy like that could cut your throat at the drop of a hat .  you know it but claire denis doesn't encourage you to judge him .  occasionally ,  there's a young russian woman -a beautiful girl who seems to inhabit someplace between heaven and earth - who does judge him .  she may even punish him .  but not denis .  there's the character played by beatrice dalle who wants no business with him :  don't touch me ,  she says .  but denis lets this man be himself ,  films him in his self-absorbed quest .  i don't know if what she films is the heart or the mind but it isn't the traditional plot basics .  whatever she films ,  you get it in the end .  you know who's  " the "  intruder ,  you know why ,  more or less ,  and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning .  but was it a movie or a dream ? 
 " the intruder  ( l'intrus )  "  is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life .    grizzled michel subor plays  " louis trebor "  like jason bourne as an old man with a hidden past ,  living simply in an isolated hut in the woods for justifiably paranoid reasons  ( but attracting pretty young women who can be useful to him )  .  we learn more about him through dreams ,  flashbacks and a journey that may unfold chronologically or not ,  as well as through his brusque interactions with family ,  lovers ,  business associates and a striking nemesis .  like  " the limey ,  "  the film resonates with parent/child regrets and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old film with the same actor as a young man  ( here paul gégauff's 1965 adventure film  " le reflux "  )  .   in a complete contrast of moods ,  we meet his son sidney  ( grégoire colin )  who has to be the sexiest house husband in the world ,  as he sweetly and seductively does household repairs and cares for a baby ,  a toddler and every need of his working wife .  surely director/co-writer claire denis must have created him as a woman's fantasy if ever there was one and a lesson to other filmmakers on filming foreplay .  there's an additional extended scene where he seeks his father in the woods while carefully carrying his angelic baby in a pouch .  he is everything his father is not and has every relationship his father is incapable of sustaining ;  no wonder he thinks his father is  " a lunatic .  "  i spent the rest of the film in dread that something bad would happen to him as the true nature of the heart of his alienated father is very gradually played out before our eyes .   the film is a puzzle ,  but subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we watch him traverse countries and negotiate nefarious deals ,  and the voice-over narration for denis's  " beau travail "  was annoying anyway .  we have to figure out from skylines and incidental signage that he is traveling to geneva ,  korea and the south pacific .  time passing is indicated by the seasons changing and scars being created and healing .  there are lots of images of water for cleansing and for distancing .    continuing her fascination with the morphing of colonialism into globalization ,  as well as playing a bit on stereotypes of the mysterious orient and russian criminals ,  denis has incorporated elements from robert louis stevenson ,  paul gauguin and marlon brando's tahiti idylls and a 40-page memoir by french philosopher jean-luc nancy ,  the last for the title and heart-transplant plot used for an ironic theme of limited immortality which does have consequences .   while  " louis "  thinks he's succeeded in being above boundaries ,  rules and morals ,  there is some amusement in the last act as the locals don't quite know what to do with him and try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey ,  even as he again lies in isolation .   several people in the audience left in frustration at the elliptical ,  but strikingly beautiful ,  story telling method .  the unconventional narrative does raise a lot of plot questions on details . 
after  " beau travail "  ,  everybody was waiting for claire denis to make a follow-up masterpiece that never arrived .  now it has .  denis makes a quantum leap in this film ,  an orgy of gorgeous cinematography ,  elliptical editing and willfully obscure narrative events that feels strange and acts even stranger .  there's a nominal plot  ( derived partly from the jean-luc nancy book of the same name )  about a mature man in need of a heart transplant and who seeks a tahitian son he abandoned long ago ;  but mostly it's an exploration of the idea of intrusions personal and cultural .  it takes a couple of viewings to fully comprehend ,  and has pacing problems close to the end ,  but it's still more advanced and gripping than anything else i've seen this year .  miss it at your peril . 
this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects .  just tell a true story about the struggles of two african american women over a turbulent century .   this movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people ,  not white ,  black ,  etc .   good movie with a good message . 
a wonderful film version of the best-selling book and smash broadway play about the lives of sadie and bessie delany ,  two african-american sisters who both lived over the age of 100 and told their story of witnessing a century of american history .  ruby dee and diahann carroll give very good performances as bessie and sadie ,  respectively .  amy madigan also is good as amy hill hearth ,  the white new york times reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book ,  etc .  many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present-day ones are very powerful ,  if not quite as inspirational as in the book .  that is the only real drawback ,  combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly ,  such as the inter-racial background of the sisters' mother and why their father was so stern .  but other than that ,  a very well-done ,  excellently performed ,  powerful movie . 
sammo hung's 1989 film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece .  i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has .  it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama ,  interesting and sympathetic  ( and also non-sympathetic )  characters ,  some genuinely funny humor and truly over-the-top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with hong kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry .   sammo and max mok siu chung play two pedicab drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century ,  i think .  they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love .  sammo is interested in local baker girl ping  ( nina li chi )  while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kit-ying he falls madly in love with .  many other characters get introduced ,  too ,  and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong !  soon we get to know ,  for instance ,  that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists ,  too ,  and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created .  as well as some nice drama .   the film has a great cast .  the leads are all very good and restrained  ( not as painfully awful over-acting and  " humor "  as in sammo's otherwise great eastern condors  ( 1987 )  ,  for example )  and they are also ,  thanks to the carefully written screenplay ,  pretty likable and easy to identify with .  the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai  ( the legendary action director and director of films like saviour of the soul 1 and 2 ,  ninja in the dragon's den and fong sai yuk 1 and 2 )  ,  the masterful composer lowell lo koon-ting  ( john woo's the killer and ringo lam's school on fire and prison on fire among many others ,  pedicab driver included !  )  ,  the shaw veteran liu chia liang  ( whom with sammo has a furious fight with sticks )  ,  alfred cheung kin-ting  ( the director of dark hk noir classic on the run from 1988 )  ,  the late great lam ching ying  ( best known for his friendly face in various hk vampire horror/kung fu/comedies )  to name just a few .  in fact ,  the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting i've seen in any other hk production .   the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell lo's character .  they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love ,  no matter what's your past or what you've done for living ,  get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner .  also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship ,  and of course love .  still i think what fennie says to max  ( about the future  " bad cooking "  )  is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively ,  unfortunately .   but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in .  which is the action ,  the outrageous and over-the-top action .  the fight scenes include traditional kung fu ,  some sticks ,  meat cleavers and the like and they're used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene i've seen in any film ever ,  jackie chan's drunken master ii  ( 1994 )  ,  they really are that great !  there are wires and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched .  simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver .  also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his/her breath as the film has one fast car vs .  pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination .  still the film makers seem not to  " accept "  the violence of the film as sammo is ,  like the late bruce lee ,  willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa ,  and i think this kind of morale ,  no matter how obvious or shallow it may be ,  is a good thing even in a harmless film like this ,  as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment .   the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i'm not sure everyone in hollywood or america  ( for example )  would understand or like at all .  the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing .  also some funny scenes are created out of sammo's passion for ping .  still ,  the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this ,  and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction ,  of course .   pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo's greatest achievements .  if the few minor flaws were not there ,  this could rate even brighter and higher .  8/10
a powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and the smash broadway play about the lives of bessie and sadie delany ,  two  " colored "  sisters who lived past the age of 100 .  wonderfully played in their old age by ruby dee and diahann carroll ,  respectively ,  they tell their story in flashbacks to amy hill hearth  ( played by amy madigan )  ,  a white new york times reporter .  the flashback and present-day scenes don't have as much inspirational value in them as in the book ,  but really are powerful .  however ,  certain aspects of the sisters' lives ,  such as the inter-racial background of their mother and the reasons behind their father's stern personality are not presented clearly .  you need to read the book to fully understand these things .  which is just as well ,  because the book's just as great !  aside from those flaws ,  it's wonderfully done and performed ,  especially by dee and carroll ,  and a very powerful and educational movie . 
the autobiography on which this movie is based remains one of the most heart-rending books i have ever read .  it tells the amazing stories of two sisters ,  both who earned devotion and respect working well into their 70's as a teacher and a dentist ,  then lived another 30 years with dignity .  ruby dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious  " blacker "  bessie ,  the dentist .  she not only expresses her anger ,  angst ,  and wisdom well ;  she lets you know exactly where they've come from using an economy of words .  diahnn carroll has the feel of the older sister ,  the teacher ,  down perfectly ,  but i'm afraid she never makes me believe that she's over 100 .  no matter -- the stories are well worth telling .  amy madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the caucasian ny times reporter .  this ,  too ,  is only a minor distraction .  the stories ,  all true ,  are the attraction and although two or three get slightly damaged in the translation ,  most of them make it through just fine .   i recommend the book as essential reading to all people i recommend any books to .  i cannot quite but this tv-movie in that rarefied air ,  but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be highly worthwhile in its own right . 
i really enjoyed watching this movie about the delany sisters .  i knew of them ,  but that was all .  this movie opened my eyes to their bravado and courage .  what a pair .  what sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms .  this is not only a movie for african americans ,  but for all americans .  it is sort of a history lesson and a documentary rolled into one and combined with an entertaining movie biography .  the acting was superior by all included and we really do get a glimpse of the hardships these two sisters went through for many years .  both sisters are quite different from each other .  they came from a very loving and very strict family with high ,  maybe even impossible standards of perfection .  it is sad to see how sadie's father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend due to a possible misunderstanding .  i thoroughly recommend this movie and i am glad i caught it on television the other day . 
a number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between stewart and novak .  she was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released .  i think that the difference didn't matter for a suspense drama like vertigo ,  but it does matter for a romantic comedy .  we can easily understand ,  that is ,  why his character would be attracted to hers ,  but it's less clear why hers would be attracted to his .   still ,  the movie works as a light romantic fantasy .  the scene where she stares at him across the cat's head ,  with her dark painted-on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring ,  is true magic .  it's a little jarring ,  therefore ,  when the scene shifts to the top of the flatiron building ,  and we see the age difference very sharply .  as he embraces her ,  she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair ,  but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee . 
the 1960's tv series bewitched owes it's idea from this movie .  this is the movie that jimmy stewart & kim novak made right after they were cast together in vertigo by alfred hitchcock .  this one is not as obsessive as that one but novak is just as captivating .   this was jack lemmons 10th movie and he is good in support here as well as ernie kovacs .  the movie has a lot of good things about it .  hermine gingold is very good in this movie ,  almost as good in support here as she was in the music man .  the cast is very solid .   this movie has a late 1950's new york city feel & a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie .  it is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any ,  & a little magic too boot .   it is not vertigo but i think because it followed that movie ,  viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved - sure am glad that william asher saw it ,  so that the 1960's series got created .  i am not so glad about what will ferrell did to it on the big screen ,  this movie is much better than that . 
bell book and candle was released in december 1958 and features james stewart ,  kim novak ,  jack lemmon .  and ernie kovaks .  this film had james stewart and kim novak in their second on-screen pairing  ( after the alfred hitchcock classic vertigo ,  released earlier the same year )  .  this was stewart's last film as a romantic lead as he was deemed too old at age 50 to play that sort of part anymore .  the movie is about a witch played by kim novak who is attracted to a mortal played by james stewart .  she puts a spell on him and he falls head over heels in love with her .  i enjoyed the movie and its cast .  this movie at the time was a moderate success which was nominated for a golden globe for best movie comedy .  gimmeclassics
this is an honest attempt to make a bewitchingly sweet love story .  the obvious inspiration behind the successful tv series  " bewitched ,  "  this lovely sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure .  the comparisons are obvious .  jimmy stewart plays a hapless but stolid  " straight .  "  kim novac plays a voluptuous blond witch who captures him through the use of a love spell .  but when that spell is broken by a stronger witch ,  she contents herself with the duties of running her own shop and takes comfort in the fact that her beloved pyewacket  ( her feline familiar )  is being cared for by her beloved aunt .  you'll recognize the aunt from  " murder by death .  "  this movie is fun and touchingly sweet ,  bearing some spectacular wit and a nice witchy feel .  worth a look . 
this impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man ,  in a mortal world .  her  " community "  is open among it's members ,  but she conceals her witchcraft from the mortals .  hmmmm .  .  . this is starting to sound familiar .  lol .  it's not your typical movie .  very  " campy "  performances by jack lemmon and ernie kovacs keep things from getting dull .  kim novak is always a pleasure on screen ,  but i found her pairing with james stewart unusual  ( but not fatal to the story )  .   with re-newed interest in all things witchy and dark ,  this film deserves to be discovered and re-discovered by old and new audiences .  .  .  .  .  .  it's still a hoot  ! 
kim novak's a witch on the prowl for a mortal lover ,  and james stewart's her choice .  scintillating comedy of manners ,  from the broadway stage ;  shot by james wong howe in witch color ,  and performed by a sterling cast .  ernie kovacs is wonderful as the perpetually dishevelled writer redlitch .  i love this movie ,  though few others seem to .  kim alone makes it a winner in my book .  ha !  my #5 film of 1958 . 
this is the kind of film that ,  if it were made today ,  it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant ;  actually ,  now that i think about it ,  this one is quite liable to be remade one day .  it's pleasant ,  but with no depth whatsoever .  it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for ,  and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak .  ernie kovacs ,  in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer ,  is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call  " wit "  .   ( **1/2 ) 
vertigo co-stars stewart  ( in his last turn as a romantic lead )  and novak elevate this ,  stewart's other  " christmas movie ,  "  movie to above mid-level entertainment .  the chemistry between the two stars makes for a fairly moving experience and further revelation can be gleaned from the movie if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for the private pain that hampers many people's relationships .  all in all ,  a nice diversion with legendary stars ,  7/10 . 
this ,   " prodigal son "  and  " eastern condors "  are my favourite sammo hung films .  the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in  " condors "  ,  but he's no less sure-footed as director or actor .  he is ,  in fact ,  at the top of his form and delivers a devastating ,  brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate ,  sweet love story also .  love and romance are not the director's priorities here ,  but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action ,  and insure that viewers don't hit the fast-forward button between the physical clashes .   the opening scene ,  which features a funny light sabre duel ,  sets a solid but deceptive tone .  a sequence in which sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp ,  comic tone .  the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp ,  superb direction ,  and easily one of the best ever of its type .  the film's violence escalates slowly until ,  finally ,  when the climactic showdown comes ,  we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production .  the director/actor's assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry ,  menacing opponents is a bone-cracking ,  physically punishing delight .   terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made .   great score ,  too . 
for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart ,  this is one of his  " lesser "  films from later in his career .  and ,  while it isn't a great film compared to many of his other pictures ,  it isn't bad and is a decent time-passer--but not much more .   kim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason ,  she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her .  over time ,  the cold and detached ms .  novak also begins to fall in love with stewart--and apparently in the witch's rule book ,  this is a definite no ,  no !  !    the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches .  they are neither the baby-sacrificing nor the all-powerful variety .  most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless  ( such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps )  .  and ,  very oddly ,  the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz .  considering what i think of jazz ,  it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world !   anyway ,  the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic ,  but not something i would rush out to watch .  the acting is pretty good ,  but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film--in fact ,  i almost scored the film a 6--it was really close . 
i have seen this movie .  this movie is the best according today's need .  dowry in marriages is the major problem nowadays .  in stating this problem this movie is the best .  in this movie ,  the indian values are stated very well .  today's youth must understand this problem .  there is less population of girls .  and due to this problem of dowry  ,  the girls committed suicide .  if this problem continues ,  then the day when there is no girl child ,  is not far away . so ,  keep in mind this statement  , today's youth must understand that we can not take dowry in marriages . we have to learn from this movie that the dowry should not be taken . and if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in the society .  this is the major change in the society . 
it's a gentle ,  easy-going 1950s comedy .  kim novak belongs to a coven of witches in manhattan .  she puts a spell on neighbor jimmy stewart out of boredom but eventually falls in love with him ,  losing her powers .  see ,  witches are permitted to have  " hot blood "  but not love .  elsa lanchester is novak's aunt ,  also a witch .  jack lemmon is her brother ,  ditto .  hermione gingold is the chief witch ,  and ernie kovacks is sidney redlich ,  an author who specializes in writing about witches .   i described it as a 1950s comedy because it could hardly be mistaken for anything else .  everything is so smooth and polished ,  from the set decoration ,  through wardrobe and plot ,  to the performances and direction .  take the character of ernie kovacks .  he's referred to as  " a drunk and a nut .  "  and here's how the movie demonstrates these traits .  he asks for a second drink ,  and ,  though he always wears a jacket and tie like the other gentlemen ,  his hair is a bit long and tousled .  that's a strictly 1950s version of a drunk and a nut .  nothing is out of place ;  everything is tidy and free of dust .  the soles of jimmy stewart's shoes are barely scuffed .   and the zodiac club ,  where the witches hang out .  it's called  " a low dive .  "  yet it's a clean ,  dark place with polite waiters ,  a quintet of musicians ,  neatly dressed clientèle ,  and potted plants against bare brick walls .  that is not my idea or yours of a  " low dive "  -- not even for greenwich village in 1958 .  my idea of a dive in greenwich village is julius's or the white horse tavern or the san remo or the swing rendezvous ,  a now defunct lesbian hangout .  the zodiac club is a high dive compared to these .   the kookiness we always hear about is muted by today's standards .  i mean ,  kim novak is odd because she runs around her apartment in her bare feet .  and she wears a lot of black clothes like the beatniks of the period did .   but never mind all that .  it's an enjoyable romantic comedy .  kim novak is effective as gillian ,  who runs a primitive art shop for the uptrodden .  she has a strange beauty ,  bulky and ethereal at the same time .  she glides rather than walks ,  a wispy presence .  her eyebrows seem drawn with a set of plastic french curves .  and jimmy stewart is quite good as the bewildered and bewitched victim .  in the 1930s he usually played in light roles .  in the postwar years and for much of the 1950s he was the tortured protagonist ,  but here he puts his early experience in comedy to good use .  who could resist laughing when hermione gingold forces him to wear a shawl and drink a hideous concoction of putrid fluid in order to cure him of novak's spell ?  it's good to see him as a stooge instead of the angry and indignant man of principle he was in danger of becoming .  richard quine directs the movie quietly ,  without fireworks or special effects ,  and does some interesting things that the play couldn't have had .  note the scene in which novak casts the spell over stewart ,  when the siamese cat's face and ears seem to merge with novak's startling eyes .   ernie kovacks in the 1950s was a well-known television personality .  there was never anything quite like the ernie kovacks show before -- or after .  it brings the word  " surrealism "  to mind .  he could stage five minutes worth of wordless and indescribable tricks in an unpopulated room with only bartok's concerto for orchestra as background .  and he did an unimpeachable sketch using the character of percy dovetail ,  an effete poet .  the credits kind of skip over the condoli brothers but that's rather casual because these two guys -- pete and conte -- were virtuoso trumpeters with independent careers in jazz ensembles .  conte was later a member of doc severison's band on johnny carson's late show .   the third act kind of bogs down a little and becomes more  " romantic "  than  " comedy "  .  but it's never dull .  the whole film rolls along as neatly as van druten's play and the kids will probably get a kick out of it too . 
gillian holroyd  ( kim novak )  is a witch .  secretly ,  she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor shep henderson  ( james stewart )  .  she casts a spell on shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her .  things are going along quite nicely until gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man .  she decides to tell him her secret .  but how will shep react when he finds out that he was  " tricked "  into falling in love with gillian ?    as far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go ,  bell book and candle is good ,  but nothing spectacular .  it's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it .  just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread .  the movie's cute ,  funny at times ,  and touching in the end .  kim novak and james stewart do their best and have some real chemistry .  novak  ( as others have pointed out )  looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way .  the supporting cast with jack lemmon ,  hermione gingold ,  and elsa lanchester is often laugh-out-loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from novak and stewart .  the biggest problem i see is that bell book and candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be .  is it a screwball comedy ?  is it a romantic comedy ?  is it a supernatural comedy ?  had director richard quine stuck with just one approach ,  the movie might have been even better and more memorable . 
i can watch b , b&c and feel all the emotions i felt when i first saw it at aged 18 well , maybe all but one . certainly miss k . novak has lost none of her silky allure in nearly half a century . she was a thinking youth's diana dors . all those thinking youths now collecting their pensions can briefly regain the heart - clutching , collar - tightening , blood - pulsing ardour they felt when she gazed directly into their eyes back in the days when they were being told that they had never had it so good .  now , huddled up against the cold and fearful of being mugged by a hoodie , they scuttle home as fast as their arthritic knees can carry them from the video shop , relatively happy in the certain knowledge that within the triple - locked comparative safety of their fourth - floor tower block flat they can regain just a small fragment of their lost youth and perhaps reflect that love truly is eternal .  this movie is miss novak's golden moment . she seized it avidly and gave a performance of awesome voluptuousness combined with a hypnotic awareness of her own sex - appeal and , despite all this , she convinces us that her character possesses a strange and beguiling innocence .  she completely dominates the amiable mr j . stewart who seems resigned to handing her the movie . misses e . lanchester and h . gingold offer comic relief along with mr e .  kovacs whose peculiar talents are strictly proscribed . mr j . lemmon plays miss novak's brother . he is a beatnik , a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its existence was being acknowledged by the mainstream . some of the more hardcore beats reinvented themselves as hippies a few years later . certainly they had become figures of fun by 1958 and mr lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint in portraying one .  but all else is mere frippery , miss novak - bathed in a particularly beautiful spectrum of technicolor - is the sole raison - d'etre for  " bell , book and candle "  . it survives , its reputation enhanced , as the ultimate showcase for one of hollywood's most beautiful women .  loved by moviegoers , ignored by critics , miss novak will continue to captivate with that enigmatic smile all the time thinking old men have the strength to push the  " play "  buttons on their dvds . one day , probably after we are all gone , she will be discovered by a new generation who will - belatedly - realise that it is quite possible for a woman to be fully - dressed and sexually attractive at the same time . 
john van druten's  " bell ,  book and candle "  is a delightful and unexpected fantasy about a coven of modern-day witches living in new york city ;  it was obviously an attractive movie property .  it had a stellar part for gillian holroyd ,  for her erstwhile book publisher enforced-sweetheart ,  shepherd henderson and her madcap family and circle ,  including shep's bewildered fiancée ,  the hateful merle kittredge ,  against whose chances with shep gillian begins her magical spell-casting .  it even had pyewacket ,  a siamese cat-familiar with well-timed miaows ,  sidney redlitch ,  a fake witch expert with atrocious pretensions and bad manners .  in short ,  it seemed to its producer ,  perhaps ,  box-office magic .  and so it proved to be .  so many things were right about its production ,  it only had one element not perfect ;  but i found the rest to be amusing ,  charming and very consistently-entertaining .  to begin with ,  the screenplay by daniel taradash kept the best qualities of the fine theatrical play but opened out its scenes to include greenwich village and other areas of new york's scene .  the technical production was beautiful ,  with cinematography by the legendary james wong howe ,  a fine score by george duning ,  more-than-clever sets by louis diage and gowns by jean louis .  in the attractive cast were wolfe barzell ,  howard mcnear ,  janice rule as merle ,  ernie kovacs as redlitch ,  jack lemmon as gillia's mischievous brother ,  wonderful comediennes elsa lanchester and hermione gingold as fellow witches and lovely kim novak in one of her most touching parts as gillian .  jimmy stewart was the imperfect element in my judgment ;  he did well with the comedic portions of his part ,  but he was never convincing as a new york book publisher ,  and a bit too-old for the part of henderson anyhow .  but director richard quine used subtle lighting ,  pace changes ,  and unusually-composed shots to indicate the oddness of the witch portions of the film ,  keeping the other portions very luminous but straightforward in their presentation .  the plot's main crisis in the film comes to pass when in reality gillian falls for henderson ,  who does not believe in witches at all .  she started out merely to alienate him from his fiancée ,  her stuck-up college rival .  later ,  when henderson tries to walk out ,  he keeps coming back to her--and realizes he is under a spell ,  as she has apologetically tried to explain to him .   .  . meanwhile ,  sidney redlich has been summoned by witching spell to come to new york to sell his book to henderson .  of course he knows nothing at all of magic ,  but is quite puzzled and interested to find out why he had come anywhere at all ;  but gillian's brother enlightens him .  all comes out right in the end in this romantic satire as gillian proves her love to henderson by losing her powers--which is what happens to witches when they truly love a mortal .  of course ,  he never really wanted to resist her anyhow .  the film has sprightly dialogue ,  charm ,  and a little  " magic "  of its own in the fey charm of the witches and the torments gillian must undergo in her battle with herself ,  and to win the man she loves .  a lovely ending to this beautifully-photographed and unusual romance makes its amazing realism ,  though a fantasy ,  just about complete in my view .  memorably delightful . 
 " bell book and candle "  was shown recently on cable .  not having seen it for a while ,  we decided to take another look at this comedy .  based on the james van druten's broadway hit ,  which was a vehicle for rex harrison and lilli palmer in the early fifties ,  the film was adapted for the screen by daniel taradash .  the film was directed by richard quine ,  who turned the play into a delightful comedy .   evidently ,  judging by some of the comments submitted by imdb ,  the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars ,  who had collaborated on  " vertigo "  ,  released the same year .  movie audiences didn't think anything about the age difference when this film was released .  in fact ,  most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women .   the film set in manhattan during christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers .  kim novak was at the height of her beauty as it's clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing .  as the witch that becomes human ,  her gillian is charming .  james stewart ,  who plays the publisher shep' henderson ,  is also seen at his best .  mr .  stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top .   in supporting roles the wonderful elsa lanchester ,  playing queenie ,  is a welcome addition to any movie ,  as she proves here .  jack lemmon's nicky holroyd ,  the brother of gillian ,  is also good .  ernie kovacs is also seen as the writer sidney radlitch .   this is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching  " bell book and candle "  . 
i watched this movie after watching practical magic ,  and the older film was far superior .  i liked the way the lighting ,  makeup ,  and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story .  jimmy stewart's mannerisms didn't do a lot for me in this film ,  but i suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of gillian's character .  i was also struck by nicky's and gillian's mannerisms--it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and gillian to appear masculine .  the gestures nicky makes when he's showing redlich his powers especially struck me .  i've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate ,  so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters . 
have not seen this 1958 film in a very long time and greatly enjoyed kim novak playing the role as gil holroyd who is an actual witch and has an aunt named queenie holroyd who is also a witch and gillian also has a brother warlock named nick played by jack lemmon .  when gillian sets her eyes on shep henderson ,  ( james stewart )  who is engaged to a girl he is going to marry ;  gillian performers some magic spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very lust full and falls in love with gillian .  the story tells that a real witch cannot fall in love ,  blush or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between shep and gillian ,  so nick and aunt queenie decided they have to do something about this situation .  great film to view over and over again and a great classic film from 1958 . 
after you see vertigo ,  then watch bell ,  book and candle ,  made within months of each other .   my second favorite kim novak film ,  with picnic ,  coming in as third .   all three performances are great ,  vertigo ,  being the best ,  of all .   they came to my nowhere kansas prairie town ,  near by ,  at salina ,  kansas in the 50s ,  to film ,  picnic .    bell ,  book and candle's musical score ,  i believe is one of alex north's .  perfect for this bit of comedy .   after vertigo ,  stewart and novak ,  did this comedy ,  how amusing to note the dramatic contrast .   worth your time ,  if you like kim novak .  the greta garbo of my youth . 
although i agree that it's a good but not great movie ,  for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned ,  i still enjoy it .  one reason is the music :  i'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the candoli brothers -- conte and pete -- in a well-staged scene in the nightclub .  these guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day ,  and they manage to convincingly boggle the mind of jimmy stewart by playing an hysterical trumpet duet ,  one trumpet in each of stewart's ears .  the candolis really did play that well ,  too ,  though i suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them .  i don't know much about george duning ,  who gets the credit for the music  ( other than that he seems to have worked with the three stooges on more than one occasion )  ,  but the casting of the candoli brothers as jazz-playing warlocks was a real nice touch . 
this may not be war & peace ,  but the two academy noms wouldn't have been forthcoming if it weren't for the genius of james wong howe .  .  .   this is one of the few films i've fallen in love with as a child and gone back to without dissatisfaction .  whether you have any interest in what it offers fictively or not ,  bb&c is a visual feast .   i'm not saying it's his best work ,  i'm no expert there for sure .  but the look of this movie is amazing .  i love everything about it ;  elsa lanchester ,  the cat ,  the crazy hoo-doo ,  the retro-downtown-ness ;  but the way it was put on film is breathtaking .   i even like the inconsistencies pointed out on this page above ,  and the  " special effects "  that seem backward now .  it all creates a really consistent world . 
once in a while ,  you come upon a movie that defines your values and shows you the true depth of human emotions leaving you drained .  vivah is just that  maybe more .  after watching ddlj ,  saajan ,  and lamhey ,  i really thought that bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never come up with anything like that - ever .  boy was i wrong !  i went to the store to buy some groceries and decided to pick this movie up along with the new  " don "   ( just so i can compare the great ab with shahrukh  although the decision is already made in my mind )  .  after debating whether i should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie i decided to watch it realizing i had nothing else to do .  when i saw the rating of u instead of an a ,  i was happy that at least it is something where i don't have to watch scantily clad women with bad acting skills doing nothing but dancing on every opportunity they get and making out with every guy to show that they have more skills in bed than a hollywood b actress .  for the first 5 minutes or so i thought i would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting .  after all everyone who has seen shahid kapor know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor .  boy  was i wrong about this movie .  this movie grabbed my interest after the first 5 minutes and would never let it go .  it was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing traditions of our society .  i liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept  ( of arranged marriage )  ,  but also that he did it with a conviction  ( that it is the right thing to do )  .  i have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good .  i felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not be considered the best ever ,  it was still very very good .  the good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the i watched that movie a second time .  the other good thing is that thee songs are not pushed into the script as we have all seen in so many movies .  these songs actually tell a big part of the story and are certainly a welcome addition .  just like ajay devgan went from being a joke to a great actor  ( after company )  ,  and salman found his groove after  " hum aapkey hain kaun "  ;  this movie will help shahid kappor jump to being of the better actors and entertainers in bollywood .  this is the first movie of his in which i like him and his role .  he acted well and adjusted to being the nice good looking young rich kid .  yes you will not find him playing basketball and scoring every point on a dunk like you saw shahrukh in ddlj  ( even though he is shown to be an indian in england  both countries not big on basketball by the way )  ,  he does come across as very believable as a person who holds true to his values .  amrita rao ,  for the first time came across as someone to be remembered .  in all her other movies she was competing with big faces which was actually hindering her .  no one knew how good of an actress she really is until they watch this movie .  some of the scenes in which she has to cry especially towards the end really shows her knowledge and depth of acting .  although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one .  i think this movie will and should do wonders for her .  move over rani  there is finally another girl who if given a decent chance to work with good directors can grab the torch from you .  she is beautiful with a great voice and has a face that exudes complete innocence .  oh having almost 0% body fat does not hurt either  ( yes people i will challenge you find even 0 . 1% fat on her and unlike so many others like sonali she can actually act too )  .  i thought i will never be enamored by anyone's beauty after madhuri and early kajol ,  but she completely changed that .  shahid and amrita worked very well together and their relationship fitted their characters and they both did an excellent job  ( although i was waiting for shahid to turn into a girl like salman did every time he uttered  " hum aapkey hain kaun "  )  .  when i finished watching this movie ,  it left me so emotionally drained that i decided to watch this movie again  ( right away )  .  yes right away .  i have never ever done that .  not even with ddlj ,  but this movie just had something that had to be understood again and again .  i will probably watch this movie a third time over the weekend just so i can watch and relive the traditions we all grew up with .  i miss those times where families sat down and had fun .  when parents had time for their kids and where kids respected what their parents believed in .  i know a lot of people think that movie does not portray real life but deep down don't we all want it to happen .  the families ,  thee tradition ,  the love and respect .  this is what this movie will remind all of us of .  i can assure you it is an extremely well made movie which you will enjoy .  i am sure some young people will not like this movie but if you are over 28 i doubt that you will be one of them . 
bell ,  book and candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century ,  very similar to the phenoms we see today  ( back in the 70's - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film )  .  it made novak a huge star ,  put a nice item on jack lemon's resume ,  cast new light on jimmy stewart ,  and gave lancaster and gingold new avenues to explore in their careers  ( both went on to continue to play witches and other curious  " old bats "  ,  in film and television )  .   along with the 40s movie i married a witch  ( which helped to make veronica lake an icon )  ,  bell ,  book and candle inspired the grand film and tv fascination with all things witchy that began with bewitched and has continued through practical magic ,  worst witch and harry potter .   what i rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative xmas movie .  the story takes place over the christmas holidays ,  and ,  despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft ,  actually embodies a great deal of xmas spirit  ( giving ,  love ,  family ,  self-sacrifice ,  etc )  .   i will always watch this movie  ( have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90's )  particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season .  it has style ,  substance ,  a great cast ,  and terrific production values .  and like adam's rib ,  it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time ,  are radical even now  ( in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful )  ,  and so always seems ahead of the times . 
as a pagan ,  i must say this movie has little if any magickal significance .  it's a  " fun "  witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magick of all ,  and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way .  that's a lesson everyone needs to learn ,  not just pagans .   that having been said ,  this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly executed by kim novak and the venerable jimmy stewart .   hermione gingold delivers a stellar performance as bianca ,  elsa lanchester  ( with too many movie credits to mention except as ms .  jane marbles of  " murder by death "  )  was wonderful as ms .  novak's absent-minded-yet-capable upstairs neighbor queenie .  also starring jack lemmon  ( wonderful performance )  and jim kovacs  ( brilliantly witty )  .    " witches can't cry .  why ,  they can't shed a single tear because their heart is full of magick .  they don't have time for silly things such as love .  "  queenie .   gillian holroyd  ( novak )  and her brother nicky  ( jack lemmon )  are manhattan witches .  cloaked deeply within the secret underworld of those of the craft ,  they live among other new yorkers as one of them ,  without so much as causing a raised eyebrow .    but then ,  along comes shepherd  " shep "  henderson  ( stewart )  ,  a steadfast ,  no-nonsense ,  dedicated businessman who is engaged to be married to gillian's old college rival .    by a quirky mishap of chance ,  he finds himself moving into gillian's building and is instantly  " bewitched "  by her charm and grace .  by the use of magick ,  with a little help from pyewacket  ( gillian's familiar ,  trained by robert e .  blair )  and queenie ,  gillian begins to work on this handsome new dream man to get back at her old enemy .   but magick should never be used to control ,  nor to hurt ,  and gillian learns that the hard way in the most bittersweet way .  not only does she have to face what she's done ,  but she has to face shep in her guilt .    from the critical perspective ;  however ,  the movie takes a serious turn :  the effects are very dated to the point of being pure camp .  some of the scenery was seemingly shot in the basement of someone's small home ,  but at least the characters were quirky and fun .   on a personal note ,  pyewacket steals the show .  great cat !  great training by robert e .  blair .    as a note of trivia ,  this is the roots for the beloved bewitched television sitcom .  this introduces the original samantha and darrin .  all the characters of note are present and accounted for .  you have but to look ,  to see it for yourself .   this is one of my favorites ,  and i watch it often .   this movie gets a 9 . 1/10 from .  .  .   the fiend  :  . 
the john van druten broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern-day witch who beguiles a successful manhattan publisher .  james stewart may get top billing ,  but it is kim novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen .  the lead pairing is ,  in fact ,  one of the movie's few weaknesses :  the gray-haired stewart seems a bit old for the role ,  and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for novak ,  it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him ,  as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook .   ( it is one of the story's amusing conceits that witches and warlocks are portrayed as greenwich village beatniks and bohemians .  )  curiously ,  the stewart-novak pairing would generate a lot more heat in  " vertigo "  ,  released the same year as this film ,  but then  " vertigo "  had a compelling suspense story ,  and the benefit of alfred hitchcock's direction .   the film's comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast ,  including a young jack lemmon  ( as kim's warlock brother )  ,  elsa lanchester  ( their ditzy aunt )  ,  and ernie kovacs  (  !  )  as a befuddled writer .  hermione gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of grand witch .  there's lots to like in this movie--wit ,  romance ,  and a great cast--that is ,  if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting miss novak .  i have seen the movie a half a dozen times ,  and i never can . 
by some happy coincidence the same year that jimmy stewart and kim novak made alfred hitchcock's haunting masterpiece  " vertigo "  ,  they also made this light comedy .  perhaps the two actors needed to do it after undergoing the heaviness of the hitchcock film  .  at any rate this a great companion piece to  " vertigo "  as it again explores a very un-likely but powerful romance .  in fact the film can be seen as the flip side of  " vertigo "  with it's happy ending .  here again novak undergoes a transformation ,  in vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she 'transforms' from witch to mortal .  stewart is again bewitched and for awhile tormented by his love for her .  unlike vertigo the two come together in  " bell book and candle "   ,  a perfect antidote for the hitcock movie .  again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined but in an altogether different vein .  the cast is terrific .  lemmon hilarious as novak's warlock brother and elsa lancaster giving a classic performance as the aunt .  ernie kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and of course hermoine gingold playing novak's competitor are all great .  the scene with stewart drinking the potion is comedy at it's best .  anyone who has seen vertigo or even if you haven't should see this memorable light comedy . 
made in the same year as  " vertigo ,  "  this is an equally bewitching movie ,  though in a much lighter vein .  it's set in an enchanted new york during the winter :  kim novak is a witch who casts a spell over james stewart ,  but gets caught in it instead .  the interesting sidelight is that novak's rival is played by janice rule ,  who originated the part of madge in  " picnic "  on broadway  ( the part that novak would make famous on film )  . 
this is a wonderful film ,  makes the 1950's look beautifully stylish .  kim novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern-day witch with one foot in manhattan and another in infinity .  all the supporting performances are terrific ,  from jack lemmon as her bother nicky to ernie kovacs as the author of magic in mexico who is working on magic in manghattan ,  to elsa lanchester as the slightly batty as well as witchy aunt queenie .  and then there is the cat- i have no idea how many witches  ( besides me )  have named a cat pyewacket but suggest a zillion .  jmes stewart looks out of place ,  but only just as much as his character is out of p ; ace in this weird sub-world of magic and witchcraft .  perfect .  and it has the perfect romantic happy ending ,  which we believe in because movies of this vintage do have those happy endings .  gillian and shep certainly have as much chance to be happy ever after as rose and charlie allnut in the african queen  ( another great film ) 
the play bell ,  book ,  and candle was a favorite of mature actresses to do in summer stock and take on the road .  one famous story ,  told by director harold j .  kennedy ,  has ginger rogers insisting that her then husband ,  william marshall ,  who was not an actor ,  costar with her .  marshall wore a toupee ,  and when he walked through a doorway ,  his toupee caught on a nail and stayed behind ,  dangling in the doorway as he walked on stage .   the play was adapted successfully into a beautiful color film starring kim novak ,  james stewart ,  jack lemmon ,  elsa lanchester ,  hermoine gingold ,  ernie kovacs ,  and janice rule .  it's light entertainment ,  about a normal-appearing family of witches  ( novak ,  lemmon ,  and lanchester )  and the publisher  ( stewart )  who lives in their building .  the most expert of them is the sultry ,  soft-voiced gillian ,  who would love to be normal .  one night ,  with stewart in her apartment ,  she puts a spell on him using her siamese cat ,  pyewacket ,  and he falls in love with her .    " bell book and candle "  was filmed on a charming set that replicates new york .  the movie is loads of fun .  jack lemmon is very funny in a supporting role as gillian's brother ,  a musician in the witch and warlock-laden zodiac club .  he uses his powers to turn streetlights on and off and to turn on the occasional woman .  janice rule is perfect as the snobby ex-college rival of gillian ,  now dating stewart ,  and ernie kovacs has a great turn as an eccentric who is writing the definitive book on witches .  lanchester and gingold ,  of course ,  are always wonderful ,  lanchester gillian's daft aunt and gingold as a sort of queen of witchcraft .   kim novak is a good fit for gillian ,  giving the character a detachment befitting a witch ,  showing emotion when it becomes appropriate ,  and with that voice ,  fabulous face ,  and magnificent wardrobe ,  she certainly is magical .  stewart ,  in his last foray as a romantic lead ,  costars with novak as he did in vertigo ,  and they make an effective team .  he supplies the warmth ,  she supplies the coolness ,  and somehow ,  together they spark .  in this ,  of course ,  he's much more elegant than in  " vertigo .  "  a charming film ,  good for a sunday afternoon ,  good around christmas  ( as part of it takes place at christmastime )  ,  and great if you feel like smiling . 
this movie was like any jimmy stewart film , witty , charming and very enjoyable . kim novak's performance as gillian , the beautiful witch who longs to be human , is splendid , her subtle facial expressions , her every move and gesture all create gillian's unique and somewhat haunting character , she left us hanging on her every word . i should not fail to mention ernie kovacs' and elsa lanchester's highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic ( kovacs )  and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to . the romantic scenes between stewart and novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great , but then again when is the chemistry between jimmy stewart and any leading lady bad ! 
stewart is a distinguished bachelor and a successful executive who is about to marry his fiancée janice rule but instead gets involved with a capricious ,  sensual art dealer  ( kim novak )  who turns out to be a greenwich village witch novak desires earnestly and intensely to love ,  but is unable to feel it .  .  .   stewart slowly falls in love with her ,  and looks for a way to free her from her witch-spell .  .  .  novak resents his well-intentioned concern ,  as does her siamese cat ,  pyewacket .  .  .  still ,  stewart continues in his attempts to change her into a loving ,  feeling woman as he aspires to marry her .  .  .   also blocking his way are such talented supporting actors as novak's brother  ( jack lemmon )  ,  a silly ,  charming sorcerer who can walk nonchalantly through walls ;  a terrible author who is writing a book about witchcraft ;  and the head of the association of manhattan witches ,  none other than the incredible hermione gingold .  .  .   novak's aunt queenie  ( elsa lanchester )  ,  unlike her other relatives ,  is a tender witch who accepts that nothing should prevent the course of true love .  .  .  she aids and stimulates them in turning novak into the woman of stewart's dreams ,  for a happy ending .  .  .   if you like to see a lightweight comedy about magic ,  fantasy and love ;  beautiful cinematography ;  stunning use of color ;  and with an exceptional cast ;  don't miss this enjoyable and amusing movie
i researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the post wwii greenwich village world of gays and lesbians .  with the exception of stewart and novak ,  the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle .  john van druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this greenwich village .  i thought this was ironic because i first saw bell ,  book and candle in the theater when i was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me .  it was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses ,  machine guns ,  or alien monsters and i planned on being bored .  but ,  i remember the moment when jimmy stewart embraced kim novak on the top of the flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground .  as the glorious george duning love theme soared ,  i suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love .  the first stirrings of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as i left the theater .  i am sure i'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by kim novak's startling ,  direct gaze .  it's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us .  i am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as i watched that hat touch down fifty years later  .   .   . 
what can i say ,  i have grown up watching hum saath saath hain ,  hum aapke hain koun and maine pyar kiya .  soraj have always been different .  movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times soraj creates something thats hard to find .  love and joint family that loving and great .  vivah is journey for a couple that are getting arrange marriage that turns on arrange and love marriage .  shahid has done fine work .  anupamji as always brilliant .  amrita rao quit different even though i felt that someway the other to me she doesn't suit in that role .  we've seen her in ishk vishk and ab ke baras ,  and main ho on na .  so quit different role that she isn't in to .  she is been excellent in main ho on na and ishk vishk but may be she could've put little more in the role .  anyways great going work by barjatya .  this movie rejuvenates the values that we forgot .  sweet film of the year .  great music and lyrics .  i am not sure if its a remake but anyways brilliant story that is original .  soraj's movies have been brilliant all the way so we always expect something different from him .  great work by all the cast the crew and everybody .  lovely family film to enjoy with your parents ,  siblings ,  friends and love ones .  i give it 10 out of 10 . 
generally ,  i am not a huge fan of stop-motion films and at first ruka didn't capture my attention .  however ,  knowing that this film was made in the repressive czechoslovakia during the soviet-domination era ,  the more i watched the film ,  the more i realized just how subversive this innocent looking little film was .  this subtext really made the film come to life and gives it real staying power as both a work of art and a political statement .   the sad little film is done without any dialog ,  but it's pretty clear what is happening .  a cute little wooden man is making a clay pot and having a lovely time when suddenly a meddling animated hand appears and destroys the pot--making it into a sculpture of a hand instead .  well ,  the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing .  however ,  over time the hand becomes more and more insistent and eventually cages the man .  and ,  by the end ,  the man is dead thanks to the meddling hand and the hand ,  in a sign of real hypocrisy ,  gives the man a hero's funeral !    as i said ,  this film is an obvious attempt by the brave jirí trnka to criticize his domineering government .  not surprisingly ,  though czechs loved the film and gave it critical praise ,  the state  ( i . e .  ,  the hand )  banned this little parable .  sadly ,  trnka did not live to see his nation liberated a little more than two decades later during the co-called  " velvet revolution "  . 
my discovery of the cinema of jan svankmajer opened my eyes to a whole tradition of czech animation ,  of which jirí trnka was a pioneer .  his ruka is one of the finest ,  most technically-impressive animated movies i've ever seen .   a potter wakes up and waters his plant .  then he goes about making a pot .  but in comes the huge hand which crashes the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of itself .  he casts the hand out ,  but soon it returns and imprisons him in a bird cage where he's forced to sculpt a stone hand .  he sets about it ,  fainting from exhaustion ,  but eventually completes the task .   in a marvellous sequence of metacinema ,  the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings ,  which keep him in thrall ,  and he escapes back home .  he shuts himself in and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head .   this movie doesn't hide the fact it's pure animation ,  unlike modern movies that strive to be realistic  ( why ?  )  .  the hand ,  for instance ,  is clearly someone's hand in a glove .  everything else is clay .  strings are visible and are part of the narrative ,  making it a precursor of the movie strings .  the atmosphere is eerie :  that hand going after the little potter managed to instill more dread in me than many horror movies combined .   the movie is obvious but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity .  it's a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny which can't help winning the heart and mind of anyone who holds freedom as a natural right . 
i saw this film when i was a young child on television  ( thank-you canadian broadcasting corporation )  and had nightmares about it for years afterwards .   trnka was one of the mentors for bratislav pojar ,  one of canada's national film board's best animators .  pojar was ,  in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great drouin .  if you like trnka you should see  " night angel "  .   the symbolism is obvious ,  but deftly used .  the oppositions of beauty and life  ( the plant )  are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand .  the poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda .   what i most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor .  the small room where the action takes place is the character's entire world .  the invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world .   beautiful and haunting film .  i found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by trnka at the public library and showed it to my own kids .  a must see . 
jiøí trnka made his last animated short an indictment of totalitarism ,  which caused him trouble in his native czechoslovakia .  the elements are few ,  the symbolisms simple ,  and his trademark ornaments almost absent here ,  allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable .  a man in his room dedicates to pottery and to take care of his only plant .  but suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of itself .  the man refuses and he's persecuted by the ominous gloved hand .  in these days ,  where the impression of reality factor seems to be erased from most animations that try to replace the real world ,  it is refreshing to watch a film ,  which makes its technique part of the enjoyment . 
an absolutely brilliant film !  jiri trnka ,  the master of puppet animation ,  confronts totalitarianism in this ,  his final ,  film .  it would be banned by the communist czechoslovakian government  ( at the time )  ,  despite taking the country's highest animation award .   in this dark and entertaining short film ,  an artist attempts to create a new pot for his favourite plant .  he happily makes his creations while dreaming that his plant will grow to be a beautiful rose .  all of a sudden ,  he here's a knock at the door ,  and in comes this giant omnipotent hand ,  that tries to force the artist to make statues in it's likeness .  the artist resists as best he can ,  but he eventually becomes overwhelmed by the constant attempts ,  by the hand ,  to force him to conform .  he becomes brainwashed ;  an intellectual zombie .  at this point the hand attaches strings to the artist ,  puts him in a cage ,  and uses him to make hand statues .  all the while glorifying the artist's work and awarding him with medals and honours .   the artist's inner lust to be able to express himself freely is what helps him prevail over his indoctrination ,  and enables him escape his prison ,  whether it be literal or in his mind ,  and return to his home where he now must live in constant fear of the wrath of the omnipotent hand .  he shuts himself in ,  thinking he is out of the reach of the almighty hand ,  but in the process he puts his plant and pot up high ,  hoping it is out of the reach of the hand ,  and it ends up falling on his head ,  killing him .  the artist is inevitabally destroyed by his own creation .  all because of the constant fear he had to live with once he escaped the hand's strings .  once dead ,  the hand paints the artist as a great person ,  a national hero .  unfortunately not in the circumstances or for the reasons that the artist would like to be remembered .   trnka's condemnation of totalitarian society ,  and their lack of right for free expression is dark ,  damning and an amazingly animated .  it is no wonder the government banned it as this is the sort of media that people admire ,  and would perhaps even listen to .  that was obviously not acceptable .  an amazing example of an artists civil disobedience and the impact it can have .  and still quite relevant today for many parts of the world ,  from the us to the middle east .  a must see and definite 10 out of 10 !  talk about going out with a bang ! 
starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the world war ii years .  when you've got such stars as gary cooper ,  james cagney ,  doris day ,  gordon macrae ,  and randolph scott ,  etc .  ,  in the film and with such people as the gershwin brothers ,  cole porter ,  jule styne and sammy cahn supplying the music ,  it's an easy to take film .  and the plot isn't even in the way .   what plot there is involves two air force enlisted men ,  dick wesson and ron hagerthy ,  trying to meet warner brothers starlet janice rule using as a gimmick the fact that both come from youngstown ,  ohio and hagerthy's father was rule's dentist as well as half of the town's .  the scheme works too well as louella parsons is soon putting them as an item in her column .  yes ,  louella's in the film as well .  she must have liked warner brothers or jack warner catered to her more than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to publicize her hollywood hotel radio program back in the day .   but the rest of the plot also touched on the real life efforts of ruth roman also playing herself to get her studio and others to do shows at the air force bases for the servicemen and women going to korea .  some of the names i've mentioned and others sing and perform in a show at travis air force base where a lot of this film was shot .   one specialty number was shot for the talents of phil harris who sing/narrates a ballad look out stranger ,  i'm a texas ranger aided and assisted by virginia gibson ,  frank lovejoy and gary cooper .  yup ,  cooper looked like he was having a great old time kidding his image .   this is the oldest of clichés when you say they don't make them like this any more ,  but they really don't because you don't have a studio system that has all this talent under contract .  that's one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn . 
as a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period ,  it's almost a must-see and rates a 9 as a variety show !  i was drawn to watch this by the presence of richard  ( captain midnight )  webb who plays the colonel in charge of the event .  what surprised me was the stunning performance of doris day .  outside of 'calamity jane' ,  i've never seen her put over a song better than she does here .  randolph scott is memorable as well ,  even if he doesn't see much screen time .  it's been a while since i saw the movie but i was almost sure humphrey bogart put in an appearance .  with so many familiar faces ,  it's hard to keep track .  if it ever turns up on a tv station near you ,  be sure to catch the doris day sequence ,  if nothing else !   
at first i didn't like the movie cause of it being a nazi swastika drama . but after buying it and seeing it ,  it wasn't that bad .  i heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and ilse werner not singing .  now i understand .  the radio show was a super propaganda radio program .  ilse  ,  johanne and zara plus rudy shruki and band like kurt widman and his orchestra and fud cantics ex cetera never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories .  the club foot had that regulated that for touring occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave radios for the soldiers also night clubs and hotels , in berlin and hamburg ,  and record sales only .  this is why ilse wasn't allowed to sing in this picture .  this would be made up by medium budget musical  , were making music ,  1942 ,  in which she would demonstrate her whistling . but this is an excellent example propaganda . inge and her aunt eichhorn , played by ida wust ,  goes to the 1936 olympics .  the aunt forgets her tickets so inge has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets .  she meets carle radditz ,  who plays herbert ,  who has an extra ticket .  she goes with him and it's love at first sight .  they plan to marry but the spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right side . carl raddatz as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain .  when he did opfergang and they put a mustache on him plus his own suntan that made him plain looking . you see the nazi soldiers acting normal , like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in france and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs .  this reflect adolphs animal rights extremism .  the character was a butcher now soldier  .  this was a subtle put down against meat eating . late on in world war 11 ,  herbert is flying in a german airplane .  we shoot one of the pilots so herbert takes over .  we shoot his plane .  they crash .  unfortunately for us they survive . another seen the nazis soldiers go in a bomb catholic church  , now it's putting the catholics down ,  and hubert's best friend helmet , played by joachim brennecke starts to play the organ ,  beethtoven ,   . more bombs come in from us .  the church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the organ he's being told to leave .  we end up injuring him .  propaganda message ?  the catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to it . it injured him .  see ?  by this time inge is with her either mother or grandma ,  played hedwig bleibteu ,  the same german grandame actress who played maria holst's aunt in weiner blut . well  , later it comes to the short view of the radio show .  this was not intended to be a musical revue ,  such as kora terry released that same year were as well as rosen in tirol ,  the music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop .  it was mainly a war romantic movie . it's easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the nazi cause ,  cause of the job and the monthly pay that they would receive .  after the war many of them who survive would regret it .  this is a good swastika classic .  the only problem is that today you have neo nazi and nazi skin heads ,  who watched the same movies to reflect their hitler worship and their .  they have disturbing websites who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity  .  be careful most of the time it's the direct hate only classics .  if their scenario looks like they are glorifying it  , then its a nazi website skip it  . go to ihf or german wartime films dot com ,  amazon dot dee or german video dot net .  they are legitimate .  01/23/10 mada a mistake it wasn't herbert's friend that got killed at the church  .  it was malte yager's character's friend schartzscop . 
i loved this film ,  at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but i quickly got into it .  there must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and i really admire the work done in cutting it down .  if you're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here ,   ( and some real tossers )  .  technically i liked it a lot too ,  they must have used a new de-interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but i wasn't annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers .   ( open water drove me nuts ,  mostly because there are cheap ,  progressive cameras available now and i see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema )  .  sorry that's my own little rant .  i definitely recommend this film if you've ever been involved with the music scene ,  it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious ,  i might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it's a classic piece . 
to be honest ,  i had no idea what this movie was about when i started it .  that's how i watch movies whenever possible .  no preconception .  i thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something .  i was wrong ,  kinda .   loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me .  i know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to do .   another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but i beg to differ .  these kinds of things do happen .  i'm sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are  " implausible "  .  really sorry but the reality of the world is that they do happen .  the creator of this movie as well as the actors did a great job of portraying how things can just go bad and how people can make really bad choices .  sometimes things turn out good ,  sometimes they turn out bad and such is life .   i highly recommend this movie . 
i should admit first i am a huge fan of the dandy warhols ,  and that is the reason i came watching this film .   the uniqueness of this film ,  compared to other modern rockumentaries ,  is that it's not just about one page of a band's history  ( like  " i am trying to break your heart "  ,  about wilco )  ,  but rather covers long period of the band's history .  in this movie ,  director/producer ondi timoner closely followed friends/rivals the brian jonestown massacre  ( bjm )  and the dandy warhols  ( dw )  for more than 8 years  ( 1995 - 2003 )  and shoot tremendous 1500 hours of raw video ,  cut than to 1 : 45 hours  ( the future dvd release will contain much more material than the original film )  .  the result is astonishing - there are no fillers - the film is 100% pure and genuine archive footage ,  which gives you feeling as film progresses that you live with the bands ,  through all these years .   both bands in the start of their careers promised to  " make a revolution "  in the music making ,  and not to sell their souls to the devil of  " record industry "  .  however ,  their paths quickly diverged - the dandy warhols signed a contract with capitol records and became relatively popular  ( especially in europe )  after only one album ,  while the brian jonestown massacre  ( with its self-destruction-bound leader anton newcombe )  dissolved into oblivion  ( at least how it is portrayed in the film )  .  and the movie follows the descent of the brian jonestown massacre ,  contrasted by the ascent of the dandy warhols .   first ,  i was delighted by the movie and its approach of telling the story of anton newcombe  ( for example ,  courtney taylor - the leader of the dandy warhols - narrates )  ,  but after some thinking i realized that something is wrong with this film .   first ,  it treats anton newcombe as a disappeared person .  the project started in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups ,  in which anton newcombe and ondi timoner were equal partners  ( that was the reason why all these years ondi timoner had unmediated access to the both bands )  .  it was anton newcombe who brought the dandy warhols into the project .  in the end he was ignored completely ,  as if he was kicked out of the project .  everybody talk about bjm ,  but he does not take part in the discussion .  i guess he wasn't even informed when the group started the final editing process .  there are always both sides of the story ,  and here we have only one .  .  .  of course ,  as one would expect ,  anton does not approve the final result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends .   second ,  the film is very dandy warhols-biased .  sure ,  the winner takes it all ,  but the fact that courtney taylor  ( leader of dw )  narrates  ( even though it seems a good choice - it provides a feeling of seemingly closer involvement )  and that bands' late history is represented nonproportionally  ( bjm is covered till 1997 ,  and dw - till 2003 )  ,  does not add objectivity to the film .   third ,  the movie is  ( somewhat )  shallow .  what does it want to teach us ?  as one critic said :   "  .  .  .  movie examines old questions :  where does genius fit into a commodified world ?  can it thrive and get its due ,  or does it need to self-destruct to preserve its integrity ?  "  no ,  it does not examine these questions !  it just depicts a story of a brilliant ,  but unsuccessful musician ,  narrated by a less brilliant ,  but successful one ,  who indulges in self-assurance and eternal coolness of an ego greater than mountain .   anyway ,  the movie was fun - it's raw ,  it's fresh ,  it's stylish ,  it's  .  .  .  just god damn interesting ,  at least for the dw or bjm fans .  for the rest of the crowd - i don't know .  .  . 
one would have to be very jaded indeed not to be swept up into this gem of a film  ( and i've seen hundreds of hindi and bollywood movies ,  too )  .  the actors ,  the beautiful settings ,  locations ,  and surroundings ,  the deep emotions portrayed ,  the sweet songs  ( especially the singing voice of udit narayan ,  my favorite )  -- everything was just lovely .  the human  ( imperfect )  element was also woven in ,  to create some drama and drive the plot ,  as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution .  alok nath is such a terrific actor ,  so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays ,  he almost steals the show from the young stars .  i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances -- ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love -- as one of the best films out there ,  hindi or otherwise ! 
dig !  i would say to anyone even if you don't like metallica to see 'some kind of monster' it is a spinal tap type documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world acting like mental kids during a breakdown of sorts .  it's fun and fascinating .  along the same lines comes dig !  a film about 'the dandy warhol's' and 'the brian jonestown massacre' two portland bands who start off a kind of music scene in there home town only for one of the bands to become huge and one to fall by the wayside into the musical history books .  right from the start the two bands pull in opposite directions just on their ability to make decisions whether good or bad .  filmed over seven years and at times painful to watch we see the dandy's meteoric rise to fame  ( thanks to that vodaphone ad !  )  and the jonestown seminal fall from scene instigators to bickering wannabes .  as the bands become more disjointed the friendships are stretched tension tight and at several points snap into arguments and even on stage fights .  all of this is half funny and half tragic and believe it or not is perversely watch able .  like i said at the beginning you can watch the metallica film even if you have no interest in the band .  dig !  on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band .  still a good film and more a testament to not be in a band than encouraging that as a career path .  dig !  is a mad ride on rock and roll's coat tails and a fine example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous . 
damn ,  was that a lot to take in .  i was pretty much mesmerised throughout .  it was pretty perfect ,  though i would say the editing had a lot to do with that .  i can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them  ( anton especially )  to get all of this footage without any serious .  .  .  beef .  the dandy's did come off well-together ,  middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation  ( and rightly so !  )  .  i felt bad for jonestown and especially for anton ,  which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt .  great piece of film-making and great choice of subject ( s )  .  i recommend this to any music/film fan .  you'll probably learn something about film-making . 
shot into car from through the windscreen ,  someone is playing someone else their latest song ,  someone else didn't react ,  according to the voice-over .  i just wonder how that came to be made .  there were too many scenes in this movie that i wondered about how come a camera was there .  if the scenes shot where the warhols descended on a bjm post-party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max ,  if not ,  then it was a total fabrication ,  either way it made me uncomfortable ,  if that was the purpose ?  all the way thru this movie i kept wondering how the footage came about .  taken at face value ,  a nice portrait of the  ( tortured )  genius we all believe ourselves to be . 
i first saw this film when i was flipping through the movie channels on my parents directv .  it was on the sundance channel and was just starting .  i love music ,  especially late 60s and this is what the bjm sounded like  ( the dandys are alright )  .  everything about the brian jonestown massacre intrigued me from the music ,  to anton and joel's personalities ,  to the illicit drug use .  it was funny because as i was watching the first party scene when everyone is doing lines my parents walked by and decided to watch  ( the look on their faces were priceless )  .  anyways this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to the brian jonestown massacre who is now my favorite band of all time .   just watch it .  .  .  seriously
although dig !  was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated .  the director has misled the audience into believing the brian jonestown massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post-'98 .  and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and jonestown has been milked .  the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film .   that said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art .  one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene .   recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands . 
anton newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject .  watching him knock up a song if not a whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent .  he thinks he is god but is so prollific and interesting .  the dw are not really that interesting in comparison musicly or otherwise .   " hey ,  do you haver a drivers license ?  "   , anton says to the cameraman ,   " well lets go pawn this guitar !  "  .  great use of archive/ home video material .  great to see rock docs still being made .  a cool doc about the creative process .  if you like this go see nirvana live !  tonight !  sold out !  on dvd .  a good experience anton is this film .  8 out of 10
i recently rented this doc ,  having remembered hearing about it from imdb . com and being intrigued by the premise .  i knew very little about either of these bands ,  but i do remember hearing  " not if you were the last junkie on earth "  by the dandy warhols ages ago and enjoying it .  that being said ,  this is my perspective on the doc :   one thing i found incredible about this film is there is no need to have any prior knowledge of either of these bands .  the director  ( ondi timoner )  wastes no time in engaging the audience and familiarizing them with the people in this film .  i quickly became grooved to the lives both anton and courtney as well as their respective bands ,  the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols .  i think that is part of what makes this doc so good ,  and what makes ondi timoner such a master documentarian .   i also loved how the  " story "  of these bands was told .  most of what you see is of the bands on tour .  both bands start out playing small venues and struggling to make it in the recording industry .  throughout the film ,  each band strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm .  however it is this that makes the two bands similar ,  and thus the brilliant perspective on how two bands of a feather can go in such different directions .   i would basically recommend this for anyone who likes film in general .  you do not need to have a particular love for documentaries ,  or either of the bands .  an appreciation for music helps ,  but the music itself takes a backseat to the love/hate relationship between the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols . 
to suggest anton newcombe of the brian jonestown massacre could also use some therapy is putting it mildly .  in dig !  which won the grand jury prize at sundance ,  we watch him and his band self-sabotage over seven years ,  while ex-friends and contemporaries the dandy warhols rise to comparative greatness  ( a mobile phone advert ,  anyway )  .   what elevates dig !  above its contemporaries is the immense ,  near-biblical comic-tragedy being played out :  a depressingly honest treatise on art versus commerce and compromise .  for all his  " look at me ,  i'm a bloody genius "  posturing ,  newcombe is in fact revealed to be a singularly gifted ,  if immensely troubled ,  musician - far more talented than his rival ,  the dandy's courtney taylor who narrates the picture .  if newcombe is dennis hopper ,  taylor's peter fonda .   even sadder ,  taylor appears to realise this ,  evinced by his weary ,  self-loathing voice-over :  he knows his band won the battle - but at what cost ?  in truth ,  they sold out ,  made indie-lite records ,  kept their teeth nice and clean ,  and probably brushed their hair twice before bedtime - thus winning record contracts and a large tour bus .  and jettisoning all credibility in the process .  newcombe ,  on the other hand ,  lives in filth ,  is continually busted ,  beats up fellow band members on stage ,  kicks hecklers in the head - and is last glimpsed in dig !  being ferried away by police ,  having lost the right to see his child .   two of the best films about rock's subculture have been directed by women :  penelope spheeris's the decline of western civilization and this one  an instant classic the moment it was released . 
anton newcombe and courtney taylor are friends ,  they both are the leads in their own respective bands ;  anton with the brian jonestown massacre and courtney with the dandy warhols .  what's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals ;  its a love hate relationship .  at times you both hear them praising one another ,  but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are .  while the dandy warhols went on the reach commercial success ,  bjm still was stuck in the underground scene ;  and for good reason why .   the focus of dig !  is more towards anton and the bjm ,  as they have a lot more substance .  they are the most dysfunctional band .  during gigs they will fight and bash each other .  anton will hit other members if he feels they aren't performing correctly .  with the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume ,  fight was always waiting to happen .  you know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens ;  that's why people would go to their gigs ,  for the fights .    anton is very unstable .  always thinking himself as a music messiah ,  he wants to change music and create a revolution ,  but he could never get out of the underground .  he is a very talented musician ,  its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill .  but his draw back is he cant escape the world he created ;  a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs ,  alcohol and depression .  on the other side ,  the dandy warhols were having their own troubles .  they didn't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label .  but they found huge success in europe .  but courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of anton .  its interesting that both anton and courtney both had what the other needed .  courtney always wanted to be musically talented as anton ,  though anton wouldn't say it ,  he needed the commercial success that the dandy's had ,  to make his revolution .   over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands ,  there is a lot of footage .  there is never a dull moment in dig !  .  it is constantly moving along as it doesn't have time to slow down as it has to much to say ,  seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job .  ondi timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more .  even if you don't like the bands it still deserves viewing ;  it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure .   you wont be disappointed . 
the movie is about anton newcombe .  the music and careers of the two bands are simply backdrop .  it's only fair that newcombe have the last word about the film ,  which at this writing you can find in the  " news "  section at the brianjonestownmassacre website .  i'd link it here but imdb won't permit it .   documentarians are limited by what the camera captures ,  as well as by the need to assemble a cohesive narrative from the somewhat-random occasions when chance has put the camera lens on a sight-line with relevant happenstance .  in dig !  ,  fortune smiled on the dandy warhols ,  capturing their rise to the status of pop-idol candidates ,  as they formed slickly-produced pop confections for mass consumption ,  most notably  " bohemian like you ,  "  a song that made them global darlings thanks to a euro cell phone ad .    no such luck for brian jonestown massacre .  the film captures little of what made the original bjm lineup great ,  with the sole exception of a single montage ,  lasting a minute or so ,  showing newcombe creating/recording a number of brief instrumental parts ,  unremarkable in themselves ,  and concluding the sequence with a playback of the lush ,  shimmering sounds that had to have been in newcombe's mind and soul before they could enter the world .   three commentaries accompany the film ;  one by the filmmakers ,  and two by the members of the bands  ( the bjm track is solely former members ,  and without newcombe )  .  both the warhols and bjm alumni point up this montage sequence as the  " best "  bit in the film ,  and i'd agree that ,  given the film's focus on anton newcombe ,  it is the only part of the film that sheds proper light on his gift ,  and seems too brief to lend proper balance to this attempted portrait of the  " tortured artist .  "   interesting thing about commentaries is that ,  unlike film ,  they are recorded in real time -- one long take -- which can be more honestly revelatory than a documentary that takes shape primarily through editing .   the dandies do not come off well in their comments .  if the rock and roll world extends the experience of high school life for its denizens -- as i believe it does -- the dandies are the popularity-obsessed preppy types ,  the ones who listen to rock because it's what their peers do ,  while the bjm crew come off as the half-rejected ,  half-self-exiled outsiders  ( to insiders like the dandies ,   " losers "  )  that are the real rock spirit .  bjm's joel gion ,  who talks a lot ,  nails the film's message for me when he says  ( paraphrasing )  :   " you can't forget that anton has been able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do .  make a lot of great music .  "   the dandies ,  meanwhile ,  laugh too easily at every outrageous display in the course of newcombe's meltdown  ( all the bjm footage here ends at 1997 ,  before newcombe quit heroin )  .  courtney taylor-taylor's discounting of newcombe's commitment to his vision is summed up as follows :   " he's 37 and still living in his car .  you can download all his work at his website .  he was so tired of being ripped off by everyone else ,  he's giving it all away .  he could be making a mint .  "  you can practically hear him shaking his head in disbelief .   the film's shortcomings can't be blamed on the filmmakers ;  rather it's the difficulties of the documentary form ,  and the loss of cooperation by the film's subject ,  that makes this portrait of newcombe so fragmentary .  but it's likely the best we will get ,  outside of his music .   i only rented disc one ,  which has the feature .  most of the extras are on disc two .  not renting that ,  as i've put in my order to buy the set . 
dig !  is funny ,  fun ,  amusing ,  interesting ,  stylish ,  and very well done .  knowing that it was made on such a shoestring budget over 7 years it is amazing that such a story can be told ,  especially with such style and substance .  if you are a music fan or documentary fan this is a must see .   focusing on the brian jonestown masssacre and the dandy warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band who meets with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a genius megalomaniacal lead singer backed up by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs ,  alcohol ,  and insanity .  if i did not know that this is footage of real people ,  i would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative scripted piece .  the story is compelling ,  concise ,  and simply amazing . 
a really cool flick .  a must for any music snob .  you don't really have to know about the bands to enjoy the movie .  before the movie ,  i only heard only two songs from the dandy warhols .  the only thing is required is an open mind .    the movie centers around the brian jonestown massacre .  the dandy warhols have a role in the film ,  as the 'rival band , ' but they are second fiddle to the bjm .  the dandy warhols don't play as big of a role in the film as i originally guessed ,  but then again ,  they didn't have the element of excitement and unpredictability of the bjm . you can't help but be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic front man ,  anton newcombe .  by itself ,  it's an insightful film and study on the music industry .  just watch this film and enjoy . 
rock n' roll is a messy business and dig !  demonstrates this masterfully .  a project of serious ambition ,  and perhaps foolhardiness ,  the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups .  with that said ,  the abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to captivate the audience .  if you've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry ,  this movie will undoubtedly be an arresting viewing .  the music in the film ,  although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting ,  is worth the price of admission alone .  the morning after i saw dig !  i went straight to the record store to pick up a brian jonestown massacre album  ( i was already initiated to the dandy warhols' sounds )  .  primarily defined by its exploration of rock music ,  the film succeeds at other profound levels .  dig !  is a sincere ,  and sufficiently objective ,  glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces . 
excellent documentary ,  ostensibly about the friendship and subsequent rivalry between two west coast retro rock'n'roll bands :  the dandy warhols and the brian jonestown massacre .  what it actually turns out to be is a portrait of a borderline psychopath - anton newcomb - and his tortured relationship with the rest of the world .  interestingly ,  for a music documentary ,  there is hardly any music .  what there is - snatches of songs ,  more often than not aborted by the performers - is incidental rather than central .  although the protagonists are musicians ,  the story is not about music but rather about a particularly american version of a british myth of a cartoon lifestyle ,  ie ,  one where nobody has to take responsibility for behaving like spoiled adolescents on a full-time basis .  tantrums ,  drugs ,  violence ,  grossly dysfunctional attitudes ,  egomania on a truly epic scale - all of this is excused or positively encouraged because it conforms to some collectively held idea about what rock'n'roll is about .  as a film this is a first-class documentary but it raises more questions than it answers .  for example ,  why is anton's music so conservative ?  for someone so wild and outrageous  ( and he is wild and outrageous )  his music never seems to have progressed beyond the most obvious derivations of his 60s idols  ( the stones ,  velvets etc .  )  for someone who claims to be able to play 80 instruments he has never bothered to learn to play any one of them beyond the most rudimentary level .  similarly ,  the dandy warhols burning ambition is based on a vision of rock'n'roll which is astonishingly fossilised in 1969 .  nothing wrong with pastiches ,  of course ,  but surely there's more to musical life than perpetually acting out a cartoon from the late 60s .  why don't they take some risks with their music - in the way that their role models did ?  because ,  one suspects ,  this is not about music .  music is just an accessory ,  a prop ,  or an excuse ,  to lead completely dysfunctional and irresponsible lives .  but why ?  in the dandy warhols case ,  the answer is obvious :  to make lots of money and be famous .  big deal .  anton newcomb's case is more interesting .  he is obviously very talented ,  but every time he is given an opportunity to reach a wider audience he sabotages it ,  usually in the most dramatic way possible .  he is terrified of success ,  and at the same time ,  deeply resents anyone else who has it - especially his former friends the dandy warhols .  fascinating movie .  highly recommended . 
i couldn't find anyone to watch dig !  with me because no one i knew was a fan of either of the bands .  naturally everyone assumed you can only enjoy this film if you like the music of either the dandy warhols or the brian jonestown massacre ,  but this is so far from the truth .  the only requirement is that you have an interest in music and/or pop culture in general .  the way in which the careers of the two groups are paralleled is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take ,  and watching the public eat up and spit out the dandy warhols is fascinating .  i agree with other reviews that mention it would be nice to get a final word from anton himself ,  since he's clearly depicted as his own worst enemy and the bulwark to the band's ability to just remain .   most interesting to me is the dandys' respect for the bjm  ( despite their lack or reciprocation )  and for anton  ( despite his erratic behavior )  .  the dandy warhols respect the art the group produces even if the group hates everything the dandy warhols now stand for  ( although that's disputable )  .  the best line is when the drummer for the dandy's says  " i won't have them anywhere new me again "  and the guitarist unconsciously blurts out  " i'll still buy their records though .  "  to me ,  this just shows how powerful good music can be .   definitely see this movie ,  even if you know nothing of either band .  it's more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this film so interesting .  it's rare to follow a group so closely for so long . 
a documentary about two rocks bands ,  spanning a number of years .  brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols .  what makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure .   anton newcombe ,  the main man of brian jonestown massacre ,  is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues ,  his friends and rivals the dandy warhols ,  but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him .  sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world .  newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience  ( getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan )  .  newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments ,  writes and produces all bjm's music ,  can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day ,  has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius ,  but is also a heavy drugs user ,  flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity ,  orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life ,  and can blow deals as fast as he makes them .  bjm go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable .   the warhols acknowledge their debt to newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the warhols have something that bjm don't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense ,  the real world ,  and their market  as a mixing pot of talent  ( even if much of it is distilled from guru newcombe )  and accessibility ,  they are the very definition of 'cool . ' dig !  follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy .  at one point ,  newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the warhols  ( in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act' )   only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against newcombe .  by the time the dandy warhols take off in europe with hits like 'every day should be a holiday' and 'bohemian like you' ,  newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated .  bjm are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the warhols get busted for drugs around the same time ,  let off with a warning ,  and even allowed to keep the grass .   the wider appeal of dig !  is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music .  the downside is that it is still a documentary ,  however intimate ,  and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands .  newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius ,  and there are feint glimpses of this in the film ,  but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this .  in the words of one of the band members :   " in every spiritual tradition ,  you burn in hell for pretending to be god and not being able to back it up .  "  newcombe isn't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime ,  and dig !  has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius . 
i've seen this movie on several different occasions .  i find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it .   type 1 :  old people .  a lot of old japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest-to-goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval japanese dialogue .  as soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences ,  the old people walk out ,  usually disgusted .   type 2 :  film snobs .  these people think that just because a movie bears the label of  " independent "  that it will automatically be a load of hard-to-follow ,  overemotional crap that may or may not be in english .  yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured .  they are really in for a surprise when they see this film .  as soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime-inspired sword battles or the over-the-top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation ,  these people will be so dismayed ,  they will walk out .  a few will stay just to see  " how bad it will get "  and later they'll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends .   type 3 :  people expecting to see live-action anime or matrix-like special effects .  sorry folks ,  the martial arts are pretty solid in the film ,  but director yamasato really doesn't have the budget for that kind of thing .   type 4 :  people with no expectations .  these are the people who really enjoy the film .  whether they had only heard of blood of the samurai ,  picked it at random ,  or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze ,  these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is :  entertainment .  this movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought ,  it was meant  ( if i may borrow a line of dialogue from the film )  to  " really kick some ass .  "  and that's what it does .   so depending on what type of person you are ,  you may or may not enjoy this film ;  however ,  if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting ,  then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends . 
i watched this movie alongwith my complete family of nine .  since my younger brother has recently got married ,  we could connect with the goings-on .  the movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple .  thankfully this time all indian locales like ranikhet almora etc have been used ,  which have been already visited by most of the urbanites ,  hence adding to the connection with movie .  the dialogues are much better than those in the  " umrao jaan ada "  - a supposedly dialogue based movie .  the background music is augmenting the  " soft focus "  of the movie .  it somehow remind me of vv chopra's  " kareeb "  ,  in which neha and to some extent bobby did full justice to the character .  same here ,  in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department-looks or acting .  the supporting cast are too good .  i rate the actress playing the role of bhabhi in the front league .  the situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters .  songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie .  however ,  though i respect ravindra jain for his body of work from movies to ramayana ,  i missed ram laxman badly .   it had no double entendres ( sivan category )  ,  no bikinis ,  no intrigue ,  and no nonsense .  you would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you're already or going to be soon engaged .  i want to express on candid thing here that though suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals ,  his approach is totally individualistic .  the movie is only about prem & poonam ,  rest of the characters are incidental .  art immitating life ?  the  " peripheral characters "  are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair .    coming back ,  everything was almost great .  except ,  for the drama part .  the situation of tragedy was artificially created .  the outcome ,  the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all .  that is why it lacks the emotional punch-the very purpose of this turn of events .  but ,  a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a 'feature film' .  but i kept waiting for the punch and it never came .  the preaching by mohnish bahal and later by alok nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard .  may be this will help the movie a tax-free status .  but the plot could have been made more interesting and non-linear than what it was .   there were too question in my mind when the movie ended :  1 has the movie really ended ?  2 has the movie ended ? 
this movie for what it is ,  may be one of the most amazing indie films of recent day .  made on a super small budget ,  the film has special effects that blow away alot of the current films !  if you have a chance watch it ! 
this films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre -- a campy b movie .  it will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy .  it should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese .  but the two come together in this film in ways that make you go ,   " hmmmmm .  .  .  that's so stupid !  "  and then have you laughing .  for example ,  there is a scene back in  " 16th century japan "  ,  which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple .  in the background of the temple ,  there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts .  hmmmm .  .  .  hahahah !  i could not stop laughing .  and the acting goes from decent ,  to bearable ,  to oh my lord ,  but that's what makes it funny .  you'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible .  i have to digress somewhat though because i have seen stephanie sanchez in several plays and she is awesome .  her air time in the film was pretty short though .  i have also seen bryan yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he's also better in theatre than in this movie .  anyhow ,  it's an entertaining film ,  if you've got nothing to do on a weekday evening . 
i first saw blood of the samurai at its premiere during the hawaii international film festival .  wow !  blood just blew us away with its sheer verve ,  gore ,  vitality ,  gore ,  excitement ,  gore ,  utter campiness ,  and even more gore ,  and all in such great fun !  especially for those of you who enjoy all those japanese chambara samurai and ninja films ,  you definitely have to see blood ! 
this is one of the best bollywood movies i have seen up until now .  family and friends feel the same way about it .  this movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time .  in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive .  shahid kapoor and amrita rao acted extremely well in this ,  also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies .  this is a must see movie ,  it's a family and romantic movie .  this movie is also from the makers of hum saath saath hain and hum apke hain kon .  this movie is their best right now .  .  .  the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction .  this movie is must see .  .  .  recommended to everyone !  ! 
a quite good film version of the novel ,  though at the beginning a little bit lengthy .  fortunately there are a few funny scenes from time to time .  this movie is surely not for the main stream audience - but for fans of italian  ( or portuguese )  cinema ,  a must-see also for mastroianni-fans . 
i thought this movie was really really great !  helena did an amazing job in it !  i thought she played her character very well !  she's an awesome actress !  !   :  )   the movie was also really funny too !  the jokes were great !  i couldnt stop laughing !   :  )   i think everyone should see it .  .  .   :  )   
   i suppose this is not the best film ever made but i voted it at 10 stars all the same .  mainly because of my feelings at the end .  i and all the people around me were simply touched .  this is something you don't often feel  .  we are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality ,  lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films .  the story of the film centres around jane a young woman in the last stages of mnd and the friendship that grows between her and richard ,  a man on the verge of a breakdown .  this could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous ,  humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie .    the acting from branagh and bonham-carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role .  the chemistry between the two also lifts the movie .    the title comes from richards masterpiece ,  a plane made of junk and his old paintings .  flying here is a symbol for both richards and janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end .    a beautiful and funny movie that i would recommend to anyone .  don't let the subject matter put you off . 
i had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication .  and it's still not at the top of my list .  but the performances from helena bonham carter and kenneth branagh and exemplary ,  almost stunning ,  and rescue this from being just another tear-jerker .  carter's depiction of an als victim is strong ,  perhaps even overdone at times  ( sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings )  .  but the overall effect is commendable and rewarding .  branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance .   
this was one of those times when i had nothing to do with 27 premium movie channels available to me .  the theory of flight grabbed me and held my interest .  i found it both touching and amusing ,  a nice combination of feelings .  i recommend it ! 
helena bonham carter is the center of this movie .  she plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity .  kenneth branagh was tolerable .  the movie itself was good not exceptional .  if you are a helena bonham carter fan it is worth seeing . 
this is the best movie i've seen since white and the best romantic comedy i've seen since the hairdresser's husband .  an emotive ,  beautiful masterwork from kenneth branagh and helena bonham carter .  it is a tragedy this movie hasn't gotten more recognition . 
i saw this film without to know what about were .  .  .  i'm a fan of branagh ,  even more his shakespeare' films ,  and ,  in the beginning ,  i saw it only for this .  .  .  and i finished with tears in my eyes ,  because the great ,  great serenity ,  values ,  affect and brave philosophy about life of helena's girl .  recommended to people who are bored with tv programming  ( in spain ,  at least )  . 
this movie truly captures the feeling of freedom .  .  .  .  .  .  . and what the freedom of your own integrity is worth .  .  .  . in the most delightful ,  light-hearted way .  not a serious ,  but hilarious adventure .   the story mirrors life .  we don't always get what we want right away but we find out we get what we need to to understand why we didn't get what we wanted .  .  .  . which results in us getting more than we thought we would get !  you will get this once you see the movie .    and this movie is truly about finding love and knowing one has found it and that it totally changed one's life .   it is one of my all time favorites .  .  .  .  .  . not easy to find but worth the hunt .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . i guarantee you will watch it more than once ! 
a bit quirky and bordering bad taste ;  but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching .  a wheelchair-bound young woman jane hatchard ( helena bonham carter ) is teamed with a reluctant caregiver ,  richard ( kenneth branagh )  .  richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight .  he builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it .  he wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent ,  dying jane ,  who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills .  wheelchair-bound and full of spirit ,  her last dying wish is to loose her virginity .  she offers herself to richard ,  who won't help her directly ;  but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed .  i found this flick ambitious and humorous .  even in this role ,  carter has a certain charisma and likability . 
i found this movie quite by accident ,  but am happy that i did .  kenneth branagh's performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter ,  but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie .  this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that branagh made with emma thompson .  carter's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time .  portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off ,  but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life ,  she made it so believable .  if this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women  " uglying "  themselves up for roles  ( charlize theron ,  halle berry )  ,  i fell sure carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar .  if you run across this movie on cable late at night as i did ,  trust me ,  it is worth the lost sleep . 
imagine the plight of richard ,  a painter ,  whose real passion is flying .  when we first meet him ,  he is seen atop a building in london wearing his home made wings .  he has ripped his canvases and other works ,  at the height of his despair ,  and fashions a flying device for his jump .  when he falls into the protective police contraption ,  he doesn't suffer a scratch ,  but it lands him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service .  richard ,  whose relationship with anne apparently ended badly ,  decides to relocate to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he plans to use to construct his own plane .   richard ends up trying to help jane harchard reluctantly .  she is a young woman suffering from a . l . s .  ,  or lou gehrig's disease and is confined to a motorized wheel chair .  jane is extremely intelligent ,  but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary .  she uses a hand held device to speak sometimes ,  as her speech is not clear .  what jane loves to do is to lose her virginity ,  at any cost .  jane and richard clash as they meet ,  but a mutual tolerance soon makes them comfortable with one another .   jane ,  who watches porn on her computer ,  has a notion for finding someone like richard gere in  " american gigolo "  ,  who will ,  for a fee ,  have sex with her .  when richard takes her to london ,  they find the right man for the job .  his fee is exorbitant ,  but they agree .  since they have no money ,  richard decides to rob a big bank .  unfortunately ,  things don't go according to plan when jane realizes that she can't go through with what she had wanted .  at the end ,  richard takes jane for a ride in his crudely built plane for the thrill of her life ,  something that brings them closer ,  as they find an affinity with one another .   peter greengrass directed this quirky film which presents an unusual situation .  jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in mainstream films ,  and yet ,  she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard not to feel for her and what she is trying to accomplish .  mr .  greengrass shows an affinity richar hawkins' material he wrote for the film .  the movie doesn't try to be cute or give a rosy picture of a young woman afflicted with an incurable disease .   helena bonham carter is the main reason for watching the film .  she makes a wonderful jane .  on the other hand ,  kenneth branagh doesn't seem too well suited for this type of comedy .  somehow ,  he has problems of his own in the way he interprets richard .  gemma jones has some good moments as anne ,  richard's former love .    " the theory of flight "  shows a good director .  no doubt peter greengrass will go to bigger and better things . 
although this movie has some weaknesses ,  it is worth seeing .  i chose it because of the cast ,  and applaud bonham carter and branagh for choosing roles different from those they have taken in the past .  both portray very troubled people ,  complete with warts ,  but make them likeable because of their humanity .  the story is touching ,  but it is the performances that soar .  bonham carter's  " jane "  is a remarkable achievement ,  whose quest for romance opened my eyes to aspects of being disabled that i had not thought of before ,  but was interesting as well for other reasons .  i felt the movie ended too abruptly ,  but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending  ( see  " stepmom .  "  )  the very real english setting added to my enjoyment - it was england in the 90's ,  both urban and rural ,  without being depressing . 
shamefully ,  before i saw this film ,  i was unfamiliar with helena bonham carter .   i had to do some research ,  in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted ,  as was her character ,  with  ( well ?  )  ,  what she was afflicted with .  i was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady .  she pulled it of flawlessly .   who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants ,  and needs ,  of a unique young lady ,  could be interpreted as tender ,  and romantic ?  well ,  they can be ,  when the right performers present them in the proper manner ,  as they did in this wonderful movie .  i forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful miss carter looked in this movie .  i have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth ,  but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie .   i hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as i did .  thank you for letting me express my opinion . 
at the start ,  this one is from england ,  so ,  of course ,  i had 98 % chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema .  i never heard of this film before .  from the minute i saw helena bonham-carter ,  i said to myself  :  oh !  here's comes the feminine version of my left foot .  i was right ,  but i was also wrong .  wrong because the two movies are very differents .  my left foot was a john ford alike movie and this one is a chaplin alike movie  ( not because this is funny ,  but chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes .  )  i was right because in 1990 handsome daniel day-lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality .  here ,  very beautiful bonham-carter did exactly the same thing ,  but with very feminine emotions .  the story is well written and it's very intelligent .  for me ,  miss bonham-carter gives one of the greatest woman's part of the 1990's ,  with emily lloyd in breaking the waves .  gee !  and look at her eyes !  she had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since jobyna ralston ,  louise brooks ,  michele morgan and ava gardner !  she's also a true talent ,  as seen on many other movies .  see this one ,  you won't regret it !  and a very fine job by branagh too ! 
loved this film .  real people ,  great acting ,  humour ,  unpredictable .  the characters were believable and you really connected with them .  if you're looking for a film about slightly offbeat characters outside the mainstream of society and how they help each other ,  this would be a good choice . 
this film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an als  ( lou gehrig's disease ) sufferer .  the subject is done with compassion as well as humor .  helena bonham carter is so convincing as a person with als that i found it hard to believe that she was only acting .  kenneth branagh ,  a superb actor ,  lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide companionship to helena's character as part of his  " community service "  ,  an alternative to prison time .  watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end .  tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances .  one comes to care deeply for the two of them . 
despite its low-key release in this country ,  and its apparent disregard in other countries  ( the 'r' rating in the states can't have helped - honestly ,  just because hbc uses the c-word !  )  ,  this is actually a fine piece of work .  the sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it ,  but it's overcome by the playing of the two leads .   it's easy to win plaudits just because you're playing a physical or mental cripple  ( daniel day-lewis ,  geoffrey rush ,  dustin hoffman ,  etc .  )  ,  and helena bonham-carter may not quite capture the physical degradation of mnd ,  but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely .  in fact ,  almost all her performance is conducted through her eyes  ( and what eyes !  )  .  this is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly undoing her english rose reputation ,  and emerging as a figure of some stature .  awards must surely follow ,  though not ,  alas ,  for this fine performance .   branagh ,  one feels ,  has never quite given his best on film  ( except possibly 'hamlet' ,  and there his playing was diluted by the large cast )  .  here ,  though ,  he tops his other appearances ,  playing to the hilt a self-loathing ,  unstable ,  ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he hasn't always displayed ,  and exhibiting both intelligence and depth .  in short ,  we believe him ,  just as much as we could not believe him as frankenstein ,  as the priest in 'the proposition' ,  as the lawyer in 'the gingerbread man' ,  even as andrew in 'peter's friends' .  this is surely his finest performance yet - so why could he not produce the goods much earlier ?   as a film ,  it looks more like a television offering ,  and without its stars it probably wouldn't amount to very much .  but it's been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks off like this ,  and i eagerly await more from them  ( though not 'love's labour's lost' .  .  .  )  .  8 out of 10 ,  but branagh and hbc get 10 out of 10 . 
well .  .  .  vivah is quite a good ,  but typical sooraj barjatya's movie .  it shows different aspects of indian families ,  wedding ceremonies ,  etc .  the movie is more than good ,  but not extremely good .   the big plus point of the movie is direction ,  music and shahid and amrita's acting  ( especially the last scene )  .  the movie starts with a common factor of indian movie--- a girl being disliked by her step-mother .  story is the movie is a bit common ,  but it is good ,  good enough to make the movie a blockbuster .   minus point is common story of bollywood movie .  overall i would say it is two times must watch movie ,  if you want to see typical indian family values and of-course love ! 
not wishing to give *anything* away here ,  i would just say this technically excellent ,  flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half's entertainment :  it will amuse ,  surprise ,  possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time ,  as it approaches the inevitable ,  but not obvious ,  ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way .  most definitely recommended .   a previous user's comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both branagh and bonham-carter's outstanding performances - i agree entirely .  .  .  . 
the theory of flight is an engaging character study of an artist  ( branagh )  yearning to break free of boredom and mediocrity ,  and a terminally ill patient  ( bonham-carter )  in the last stages of asl ,  confined to a wheelchair ,  who desires to make love to a man before dying .   helena bonham-carter exudes wit ,  defiance ,  and independence as an asl patient who is virtually dependent upon people around her to take care of her .   kenneth branagh ,  sentenced through community service to take part in caring for her ,  complements helena's charm with woeful melancholy ,  creating a sentimental ,  compelling love story in which two people try to help each other find the road to happiness ,  before time runs out . 
myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of tenko and agree this is by far one of the bbc better series . the whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without it . no doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which i would never get sick of watching . excellent viewing and full marks to the bbc for such a brilliant series and the casting . first rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits must be considered because of some adult material . so grateful to the bbc for releasing this series on dvd and video . 
well ,  tenko is without doubt the best british television show ever ,  the performances ,  the directing ,  the casting ,  the suspense ,  the drama .  .  .  .  .  everything is fantastic about it .   although the show fell a little later in its final season ,  this ending movie picked up the threads nicely and wove a superb story for fans of the show and newbies .  i cannot recommend this movie more ,  find it and watch it .  but i do advise watching the series first ,  as the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie .   an obvious  ( 10/10 ) 
a very gritty ,  gutsy portrayal of a part of world war 2 history ,  that most of us in the u . s .  had/have no idea ever occurred .  i would love to have this on video .  it only was shown on t . v .  one time as far as i know ,  back in 89or 90 .  i have asked around for this movie ,  and most video stores don't even know about it .  great actresses all around ,  wish that i could see it again .  top notch series . 
five years on from the tenko survivors returning home ,  and from marion's double-edged  " well that's that "  .   it's now 1950 :  reunion time .  the gang's all here :  marion ,  bea ,  ulrica ,  kate ,  dorothy ,  christina ,  dominica ,  and latecomers maggie and alice .  the story that unfolds is a beaut :  as perfectly written and acted ,  and as thought-provoking and moving ,  as the original series .   all the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here .  from marion's family to joss's health centre ,  everything has changed in five years ,  and not everything has changed for the best .   a trip to dominica's plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge-of-the-seat tension .  there's a real sense of tragedy and disaster as ,  once again ,  fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives .  dominica finally shows her true colours ,  and there are some shout-at-the-telly moments of drama .   lush location filming in singapore ,  and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends .  it's such a shame that this really is the end .  i could watch it all over again .  perfection . 
the film belongs to inventor - underdog genre .  jake gyllenhaal ,  laura dern and chris cooper bring a little acting verve to story with several standard elements .  well filmed ,  well edited ,  with plenty of well acted secondary roles .   some have declared this movie to be classic american hokey .  it is that and more .  i agree with those who say  " the movie celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration .  "    the film is a pleasant reminder that achievement may be born of ordinary roots .   
in my opinion ,  october sky is one of the best movies of 1999 .  .  . it totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need ,  like ,  wonderful story and good character interactions .  october sky will remain in heart for as long as i can remember ,  and i just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film . 
above-average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line .  even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time .  a scent of  " pleasantville "  camp hangs around this flick .  as a period piece ,  it's more accurate than not .  its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy but moving .  chris cooper turns in a first-class performance as howard's coal-miner daddy . 
this movie will kick your ass !  powerful acting in a story that pushes all of us to live out our dreams .  jake gyllenhaal will go places from here ,  and the supporting cast was superb .  why would would anyone want to stay in coalville and develop black lung anyway ? 
i saw that movie few days ago .  this movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad that you have always dreamed about it - you can have it .  this shows a big wish come true trought happiness and sadness ,  hopeless and failure .  but if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something that you love you can make things different and be happy . 
i thought this movie was really really great because ,  in india cinemas nowadays ,  all you see is skin ,  music ,  and bad acting .  .  . in this movie ,  you can see some tradition ,  ethnicity ,  and at least some decency .  .  . although some parts were a little dramatic ,  guess what ?  that is what indian cinema is all about !  after watching this movie ,  at least you don't get a headache from all the loud overrated music ,  or any violence ,  its just the truth ,  it teaches about love ,  and of course caring for the person you love throughout life .  .  . i think it was an amazing movie .  .  . kids can watch it without a doubt ,  and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be india's sure profoundness .  .  . until all these rap hits ,  miniskirts ,  and skin showing became a part of it . 
this film caught me by surprise .  my friend told me that this movie was a  " chick flick .  "  boy ,  was he wrong !  this movie has a great family appeal ,  with no sex scenes like _other_ movies .  jake gyllenhaal does an excellent job in homer hickam's shoes .  the supporting cast is great ,  as well .   science ,  coming-of-age ,  family quarrels ,  a great train scene .  .  .  this film has it all .  the soundtrack is good ,  although the score is presented quite choppily .  the 50s music kicks the movie over the edge of greatness .   the dvd is definitely worth its weigh in coal .  replay value is great - i've seen it quite a few times already . 
  i'm sure things didn't exactly go the same way in the real life of homer hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book ,  rocket boys ,  but the movie  " october sky "   ( an anagram of the book's title )  is good enough to stand alone .  i have not read hickam's memoirs ,  but i am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation .  the film ,  directed by joe johnston and written by lewis colick ,  records the story of teenager homer hickam  ( jake gyllenhaal )  ,  beginning in october of 1957 .  it opens with the sound of a radio broadcast ,  bringing news of the russian satellite sputnik ,  the first artificial satellite in orbit .  we see a images of a blue-gray town and its people :  mostly miners working for the olga coal company .  one of the miners listens to the news on a hand-held radio as he enters the elevator shaft ,  but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness ,  losing sight of the starry sky above him .  a melancholy violin tune fades with this image .  we then get a jolt of elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting :  october 5 ,  1957 ,  coalwood ,  west virginia .  homer and his buddies ,  roy lee cook  ( william lee scott )  and sherman o'dell  ( chad lindberg )  ,  are talking about football tryouts .  football scholarships are the only way out of the town ,  and working in the mines ,  for these boys .   " why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college ,  "  questions homer .  roy lee replies ,   " they're also the only ones who get the girls .  "  homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother ,  so he is destined for the mines ,  and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine foreman .  until he sees the dot of light streaking across the october sky .  then he wants to build a rocket .   " i want to go into space ,  "  says homer .  after a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's  ( natalie canerday )  fence ,  homer enlists the help of the nerdy quentin wilson  ( chris owen )  .  quentin asks homer ,   " what do you want to know about rockets ?  "  homer quickly anwers ,   " everything .  "  his science teacher at big creek high school ,  miss frieda riley  ( laura dern )  greatly supports homer ,  and the four boys work on building rockets in homer's basement .  his father ,  however ,  whose life is the mine ,  does not support him .  john hickam  ( chris cooper )  believes that homer shouldn't waste his time on the rockets ,  that the coal mines are all that matter .  the coal from the mines is used to make steel ,  and without steel ,  the country would be nothing .  the difficult relationship between homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships i have ever seen in a film .  miss riley introduces homer to the idea of entering the local science fair ,  with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship .   " you can't just dream your way out of coalwood ,  "  she tells homer .  homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets ,  improving the models with each attempt .  despite the many attempts ,  the boys do not lose their determination .   " what are the chances of us winning that science fair ,  "  o'dell asks homer in one of their more despairing moments .   " a million to one ,  "  answers homer .   " that good ?  "  o'dell replies ,   " well ,  why didn't you say so ?  "  the music ,  composed by mark isham ,  conveys sadness and hope at the same time ,  especially sad at a point when homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of coalwood .  rollicking 1950s' rock and roll ,  including songs by the coasters and buddy holly ,  occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light-hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers' lives with the lives of the miners .  the film ,  photographed by fred murphy ,  also uses colors to set moods and symbolize .  the town of coalwood ,  actually filmed in tennessee ,  is washed with blues ,  grays ,  and browns .  it's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything- faces ,  clothes ,  houses ,  and roads .  when a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys ,  it is obvious that they are from the world outside of coalwood and the olga coal company .  the book on guided missile design that miss riley gives homer is red .  the red stands out enough against the blue-gray world of coalwood to symbolize  " getting out "  ,  but it is still subtle .  the reds are fleeting hints of a world that homer only dreams of .  jake gyllenhaal expresses such zeal ,  hope ,  and pertinacity as homer hickam that it is hard to believe he isn't the real homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film .  chris cooper is also extraordinarily believable as homer's stubborn father ,  who doesn't recognize ,  or just doesn't want to admit ,  that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive .  homer ,  and everyone who encourages him in his rocket-building ,  is aware that the town is dying .  with the community disintegrating ,  the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys' demonstrations .  again ,  i'm sure things didn't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them ,  but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism ?   " october sky "  has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real . 
maybe not the most original way of telling a story ,  we've seen all this before in many movies .  .  but .  .  i liked it october sky alot anyways .  it got something ,  great directing and good acting by all parts ,  especially laura dern ( the teacher )  and chris cooper ( the father )  .  i wanna be a rocket-engineer !  :  ) 
i watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to billy elliott  ( 2000 )  .  both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship .  in both films ,  the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town .  both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them .   the major difference that i found between the films was that october sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film .  laura dern puts in a moving performance and chris cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in american beauty  ( 1999 )  .  joe johnston surprised me with his subtle directing ,  very different from his other directorial features such as jumanji  ( 1995 )  and jurassic park iii  ( 2001 )  .   
this film was absolutely brilliant !  !  every performance in this film is excellent ,  especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper .  it looks like mr gyllenhaal will have a huge film career if this is anything to go by .  i thought that joe johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbusters ( jumanji ,  honey i shrunk the kids )  .  he pulls of every scene with sheer class .  my favourite scene was where homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky ,  going down ,  as all of his dreams were ,  it was beautiful .  joe johnston should direct more of these brilliant ,  acting driven films as well as his big budget blockbuster faire ,  which is also excellent .  kudos !  !  to all involved in this masterpiece ! 
the acting in this movie was superb .  as an amateur rocketeer ,  i found very few mistakes .  as a human being ,  it touched my heart and soul .  to watch the actors ,  you would think that they are the actual characters .  laura dern ,  a favorite actress of mine ,  left nothing out of her performance .  the young actors playing the rocket boys showed talent beyond their years ,  especially young homer .  homer's father inspired that eternal love/hate relationship between a father and son so that it felt real .  if you don't get a lump in your throat or shed a tear when that first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms ,  then get your pulse checked  ( you may be dead )  . 
my wife did not realize what a gem this movie was when she picked it up .  it is a story that shows real world success through hard work and determination .   that is so refreshing in a world of violent movies not that i dis-like them )  ,  but you have to love a movie that succeeds without it . 
october sky is a highly lauded movie ,  and it¡¦s easy to see why .  the story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping ,  the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs ,  especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper ,  the hero finally gets what he wants ,  and it¡¦s a true story .  frankly i think the director¡¦s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates .  we don¡¦t see any special narrative or cinematography ;  the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters .  we feel homer¡¦s desire to earn his father¡¦s recognition and create his own future ,  and his resilience wins our respect .  ¡§october sky¡¨ reminds me of a later 2001 japanese production of mini series ¡§rocket boy , ¡¨ which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie .  actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison .  when october sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny ,  ¡§rocket boy¡¨ offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society .  starring the outstanding actor yuji oda ,  ¡§rocket boy¡¨ focuses on three men as ordinary as can be :  a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut ,  a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother  ( like what homer feels in his family )  ,  and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea .  the collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them ¡§impossible . ¡¨ to compensate for his lost ideal ,  kobayashi  ( yuji )  works in the tour operator because it¡¦s called ¡§galaxy . ¡¨ when his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him ,  he finally finds strength from his father¡¦s words ,  who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed .  ¡§but i don¡¦t regret it , ¡¨ his father told kobayashi ,  ¡§at least i tried . ¡¨ it is his father¡¦s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair .  kobayashi¡¦s effort finally fails ,  and he goes back to the travel agency .  but his ¡§crazy¡¨ courage inspires his friends ,  and everyone loves him more .  just before the end of the series ,  kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts .  after the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree ,  unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says :  ¡§astronauts wanted for 2004 . ¡¨ kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs ,  just like a kid looking at his ticket to disneyland .  kobayashi may never get what he wants ,  but he dares his destiny and ¡§just does it . ¡¨ this series is so heart-gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds ,  but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy .  unlike dilbert or other sarcastic writings ,  this show enlightens us and teaches us something .  homer and kobayashi both have the dream ,  and they do what they can despite other people¡¦s opinions .  i recommend other imdb users to see the japanese tv series .  if you are a nine-to-fiver ,  you will feel more touched .  i feel sorry that imdb doesn¡¦t have its data ,  maybe you can ask somebody from japan to help you . 
i loved october sky .  the thing i loved most had to be the music .  it worked two ways :  in the first hour of the film ,  it gives the viewer a time-frame .  this is done by playing songs from the late fifties .  in the second hour ,  an instrumental score takes over .  the music now fits the mood of the film perfectly .   i did not only enjoy the music ,  i also quite enjoyed the cast .  jake gyllenhaal as homer hickam was especially a surprise for me .  he gave off a first-class performance ,  as did chris owen  ( quentin )  and chris cooper  ( john hickam )  .   i've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now ,  and both times i thoroughly enjoyed myself . 
i can honestly say i never expected this movie to be good .  i do not like family films .  i am far from a fan of shahid kapoor .  the director's last movie  ( mpkdh was complete stupidity .  and the music was very boring and bland .  but there was amrita rao ,  who has become my favorite after main hoon na .  there was also seema biswas ,  alok nath ,  and anupam kher who are very talented .  so a few plus points .   i finally saw the movie and i was very impressed .  he brings us the young lovers of mpk with a pinch of the hahk wedding ,  and we have a winner .  the story outline is similar to hahk ,  light hearted in the beginning to serious mode at the end .  the director also made character that you could relate to .  the thing i did not like about hahk was that the characters were too eccentric .  the casting adds to its perfection .  shahid kapoor surprised me with a good performance .  this is a major improvement ,  and most importantly he suits the role .  the best is easily amrita rao .  in fact ,  this is her best performance .  her screen presence is so electrifying ,  you are bound to love her performance .  sameer soni ,  amrutha prakash ,  anupam kher ,  alok nath and seema biswas are terrifically cast .  not one actor feels out of place .    the songs were quite disappointing but they will sound better after watching them .  mujhe haq hai and do anjaane ajnabi are nice ballads .  milan abhi aada adhura hai is also nice in watching .  the songs aren't colorful and dancey ,  and they are more like ballads .  the exception is hamari shaadi mein which is bound to remind you of hssh and hahk .  so what was the flaw in the movie ?  the movie gets quite slow ,  and the ending is quite stretched .  but the movie is still goes at a good pace ,  making it a perfect family film . 
i grew up in southern west virginia ;  i'm about the same age as  ( or maybe a year older than )  homer hickam ,  author of  " the rocket boys ,  "  the book forming the true-story basis of this heart-warming film .   and so i relate closely to the west virginia coal-mining theme ,  and to the stunning effect sputnik had at that time  ( october 4 ,  1957 )  on all of us .  the rocket boys went on to make great lives for themselves .  i went on to get my degrees in physics and computer engineering .  all because sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the  " science gap "  the u . s . s . r .  had on the u . s .  in those cold war days .  .  .   this is a wonderful film for everyone ,  of all ages .  but if you grew up in west virginia in the late 1950's ,  it'll touch the core of your being .   everyone :  get it ;  watch it ;  recommend it to your friends .  .  .  who'll thank you many times . 
a true wholesome american story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural west virginia coal mining town ,  after the launch of sputnik in 1957 .   through trial ,  tribulations and perseverance beyond belief ,  they are ultimately able to achieve their goals .   jake gyllenhaal ,  as the leader of the group ,  is excellent in the title role .  as his motivating science teacher ,  laura linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the top .   there is a standout supporting performance by chris cooper ,  a head miner ,  who wants his son to follow in his footsteps ,  but gradually comes around at film's end .   what makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed-hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever .  it is the epitome of an american story that is well done .   besides the science angle ,  we have the father-son disagreement ,  football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining ,  and the loving spirit of family .   why aren't pictures like this recognized more at award times ? 
suraj barjatya is best in movies on marriage .  and here he is ;  back to his basics on vivaah .  as the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage .  a movie you can watch with your entire family around you .  a movie you will hate watching alone .  the story is simple ,  but the music is good ,  cinematography is excellent ,  direction is best ,  everything about the movie has a class of its own .  there are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart ,  you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the movie .   shahid & amrita jodi has given us hit movies earlier like ishq vishq ,  & shikhar .  though shikhar was a good movie it wasn't accepted well by the public . a truly shahid & amrita film . 
based on fact ,  this is the story of a teenager named homer hickam  ( jake gyllenhaal )  ,  growing up in a coal town in west virginia where a boy's usual destiny was to  " end up in the mines .  "  but homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets ,  to the dismay of his mine-foreman father ,  and the consternation of the townsfolk generally .  a misfit for sure ,  he and three of his equally outcast buddies begin making rockets ,  which they fly from a patch of barren land eight miles out of town ,  so as to no longer terrorize the community with their oft-times errant rockets .  unfortunately ,  most of the town and especially homer's father  ( chris cooper )  thinks that they are wasting their time .  however ,  the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in droves to watch the 'rocketboys' send off their homemade missiles .  only one teacher  ( laura dern )  in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize .  now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars .  director joe johnston has always been a famous name for his movies such as jumanji & jurassic park 3 &  " october sky "  surely stands above all of his other films .  without any doubts ,   " october sky "  is his best effort & obviously his best film .  it's not only a true story filmed extremely well ,  but even as a movie ,  it has every single thing ,  which is required for a top level cinema .  and along with johnston's extra-ordinary direction ,  are some exceptional performances .  jake gyllenhaal was around 19 ,  when this movie was released & he gives a beautiful & natural performance .  he is a perfect actor .  chris cooper as his father ,  also gives a very fine performance .  the same goes for laura dern & also she looks beautiful .  even the rest of the performances are extremely well .  the background score was fine .  highly inspiring movie ,  which lifts up your spirit sky high .  one of those movies which definitely inspires you for all of your life .  an amazing inspiring movie along with loads of entertainment .  not to be missed . 
i think i read this someplace :  joe johnston  ( director of the film and also one of the guys who founded industrial light and magic for work on the first star wars film )  and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie ,   " rocket boys "   ( i guess )  was lacking something .   one day they were messing with a pc program that forms words from other words  ( ie :  you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words )  i think the technical term is an  " anagram "   anyway ,  they typed in  " rocket boys "  and sure enough what comes back is  " october sky "  .  they were shocked to say the least .  the title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around sputnik .  at first homer jr did not like the idea ,  but he warmed up to it after the  " movie poster paperback novel "  came out and took off . 
i just accidentally stumbled over this film on tv one day .  it was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies .  this one ,  however ,  was nothing less then good .   october sky tells the true story of homer hickam ,  a boy inspired by the sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist .  he and his friends begin to build rockets .  his father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal-miner as himself or go to college on a football-scholarship like his brother .   the story is well written .  a bit too predictable maybe ,  but that's ok cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story .  it's important part ,  but where this is obvious the inner action ,  the action between the characters is focused on .  the story is good .  it has some clichés ,  but that's ok .  it's based on actual event's so you kind of can't just drop out these clichés .  the characters are really good .  where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high .  you get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them .  they are well written and believable .   this is a good looking movie .  the sets and the 50's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit .  this all sets the mood of the film very good .   the acting is really good .  jake gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as homer hickam and chris cooper is good as john hickam .  as for the rest of the cast they are good too .  all together this makes out a pretty strong cast .   all in all i'm glad i caught this movie .  it was first after seeing it i learned that it was based on actual events .  if i had known that when seeing it ,  it would probably just be even more interesting .  october sky is a good and interesting movie .  it's a movie i believe everyone can enjoy .  it's kind of a feel-good movie .  not bad at all ! 
i have recently seen this movie due to jake's recent success with brokeback mountain .  i figured i would see the movies that i missed .  i had no expectations going into the film so was astounded that i had missed this movie at all .  it's a gripping father and son tale ,  and it is also an underdog story .  i even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale .  this movie appeals to all ages .  the only reason i give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a little in the middle ,  but it comes back strong in the end .  the acting was great ,  the story was magnificent ,  and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film .  go see this movie !  rent it ,  buy it ,  watch it ,  love it !  i know i did ! 
there is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where homer watches the attempt of december 6 ,  1957  ( at least that was the video used on the tv he was watching )  which showed the vangard launch attempt ,  which failed .   he is next shown reading or dictating a letter to dr .  von braun offering condolences about the failure .   von braun was at marshall space flight center in huntsville working for the army .  the vanguard project was by the early nasa team which was at what soon became goddard space flight center .   the army rushed the jupiter-c ,  which was essentially a us made v2 technology ,  but worked to launch a satellite in response to russia's success with sputnik .   this error may have actually been made by homer ,  because of the notoriety of von braun ,  but his team didn't have their attempt fail .  in fact the underlying redstone was flying from 52 and was the first us man rated booster ,  used for shepard's sub orbital flight ,  as well as grissom's .   this is why this sort of movie is so good ,  as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia ,  and in the process see what has been done ,  and be inspired to do more . 
i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead  ( 2005 )  a little while back and ,  since then ,  i've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen .  like clive owen ,  he has an intensity  ( and he even resembles owen somewhat )  that just oozes from the screen .  i feel sure that ,  if he lands some meaty roles ,  he'll crack an oscar one day .  .  .   that's not to denigrate this film at all .   it's a fine story ,  with very believable people  ( well ,  it's based upon the author's early shenanigans with rocketry )  ,  a great cast  chris cooper is always good ,  and laura dern is always on my watch list  with the appropriate mix of humor ,  pathos ,  excitement .  .  . and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping .   but ,  this film had a very special significance for me :  in 1957 ,  i was the same age as homer hickham ;  like him ,  i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness ;  like homer also ,  i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel ;  and like homer ,  i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster !  what fun it was .  .  .   i didn't achieve his great  ( metaphorical and physical )  heights though .  but ,  that's what you find out when you see this movie .   sure ,  it's a basic family movie ,  but that's a dying breed these days ,  it seems .  take the time to see it ,  with the kids :  you'll all have a lot of good laughs . 
a simple and effective film about what life is all about ,  responding to challenges .  it took a lot of gall for homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son ,  to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate .  it took also three different challenges for homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future .  the challenge of the first ever man-made artificial satellite ,  sputnik 1 ,  a soviet satellite ,  a milestone in human history ,  a turning point that homer and his friends could not miss ,  did not want to miss .  then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds .  finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack ,  even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity ,  and even then homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams .  but there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough .  homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need .  if he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship ,  because his friends gave him precedence ,  his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate ,  thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes .  it is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road .  but the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man ,  like mining or football .  the working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father .  if the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day ,  the working class fate i am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap .  here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think .  this might have been the fourth challenge homer had to face :  the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father .   dr jacques coulardeau ,  university paris dauphine & university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne
i resisted seeing this movie and i understand why it was not a big hit in theatres .   " october sky "  feels and looks oh so familiar .  and it is .  all plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films -- and possibly even better .  but despite it's familiarity and resistance to all formulas hollywood ,  this movie is winning and likeable at every turn .    sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart ,  mind and soul .  just as the characters from steven sondheim's musical merrily we roll along stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation  (  " what do you call it ?  you call it a miracle .  "  )  ,  sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale .  while jaded townsfolk of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event ,  homer hickham sees sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines .   masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy homer and his pals seem fresh and new .  especially affecting are subplots concerning homer's ailing young school teacher .  remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship .  also remarkable is the father / son supblot that anchors the film .  perfectly played all around .  even homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion .  her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking .   " myrtle beach "  says it all .    a major video chain i despise has a sign next to this film stating that you'll love this film or they'll refund your money .  for once ,  i agree with them .  you'll never look at the october sky quite the same again .   
there is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by joe johnston that goes something like this :   " the man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right .  "  that is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual ,  which ,  in this movie ,  stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way .    " october sky "  is about a young man who believes in himself named homer hickam ,  growing up in a strict ,  traditional family in the 1950's .  homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner .  all of his friends ,  quentin ,  roy ,  and o'dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's .  homer is not exited about that future .   one night ,  while everyone stares at the sky ,  a russian space craft called sputnik passes overhead .  this is something new for homer ,  and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming .  from this point on ,  his look at life will never be the same .   first ,  he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation .  flabbergasted at what he says ,  his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual his friends ,  however ,  think that this idea may have some potential .  after all ,  quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing .   when the four friends start to test model rockets ,  and blow a white picket fence to smithereens ,  then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them ,  they're forced to end their progresses .   the performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish .  all of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here .  standing out in all of the glory :  laura dern as miss riley .  this very well may be academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released .   the characters are also extremely well developed .  not only to the filmmakers give clear ,  apparent reason why homer is interested in the subject ,  but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry .  we clearly understand all of the characters' motives and beliefs ,  especially the father ,  who is bent over on everlasting tradition .   the film ,  unfortunately ,  loses some of its momentum at mid-point because of a silly ,  recycled romantic sub-plot involving homer's love interest and how his brother stole her from him .  this type of this is becoming so awfully common in high-school movies ,  not that this film is aimed at high-schoolers .  the actors stare at each other mindlessly ,  like the are in a trance .  i put up with it without complaining in 1997's  " inventing the abbots ,  "  but i have had just about enough this .   but that is just a minor complaint .  with an authentic looking time period ,  cinematography worth an oscar and clips of the real life homer and friends at the end ,  whom all hit it big with their dreams ,  especially homer ,  this is the first great film of 1999 .   
this is a gem ,  a real piece of americana for all that this implies .  if you are self programed to resist  " life-afirming "  stories ,  just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe .  and what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story ,  no need to nit-pick what details were changed to make a compact story .  chris cooper is one of the greatest living actors ,  and the complex ,  self-conflicted ,  bottom-line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight .  the simple minded comments ,  refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off-track ,  expose the limitation of the commentator ,  not the writers or the acting .  this is not for the cynical ,  or the simple minded . 
i had lost faith in sooraj r .  barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon ,  then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good .  but i didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema .  when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj .  i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie .  sooraj r .  barjatyagot it right this time ,  okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun .  but i have always loved manie pyar kiya ,  after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work .  i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying .  if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie ,  the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it ,  my view a much underrated movie .   the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times ,  but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition .  it's done in present times ,  lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage ,  but i do .  the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly .  when prem meets poonam for the first time ,  they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen .  it was a very sweet ,  you feel nervous yet excited ,  the song  " do ajnabe "  shows that very well .  getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam  ( shahid kapoor and amrita rao )  and there families .  a twist occurs in this movie which is really good ,  the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box .   what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam ,  how they fall for each other is too sweet .  simple boy and simple girl ,  when they first meet during and after the song  " do anjane ajnabe "  it's very sweet to watch ,  she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking .  then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other .  it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have .  another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness ,  you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem .  when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl .  which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie ,  her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness .  shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too ,  he is poonam support in the film ,  he is her happiness the movie ,  together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol .  if ishq vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will .   " mujhe haq hai "  the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show .  scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet .  again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to .  the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever .   the direction is spot on ,  to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them .  to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie .  the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop !  the music is amazing ,  the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for ?   what i can finally say it ,  rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good ,  this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person .  its basically the sweetest journey ever ,  its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your lifewell this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that ?  why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing !  watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing ! 
i was watching this when my wife called to inquire from the other room as to my choice of fare .  my comment ?   " i am watching my life !  "   though younger ,  but only by 5 years or so ,  than the  " rocket boys "  i remember the absolute urgency with which sputnick was greeted by our administrators of education and how the whole science fair thing gained momentum and took me and others into the competitive whirlwind .  my own tornado landed me in my own state's science fair ,  in physics by '62 ,  though our group was less successful in gaining the support of ,  for example ,  firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event ,  our city went so far as to allow us to tour the nike missile site on chicago's lakeshore .   this movie brought it all back for me and i will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us  " ubernerds "  of the late '50s and early 60's .   we are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country .  see it ! 
this is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more hectic and loud films .  it is another solid based-on-a-true store ,  which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes .  frankly ,  i don't know but i liked the story .   the story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else ,  including his father ,  does in this west virginia town .  the big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father ,  which i think was overdone .  i would like to have a little less tension between the two .   the young man ,  still a boy ,  is played by jake gyllenhaal ,  one of his first staring assignments ,  i think .  he's likable ,  as are his school buddies in here .  it's nice to see nice kids in a modern-day film .  the two other key actors in the movie are chris cooper  ( the dad )  and laura dern  ( the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time .  )   the cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear .  once again :  i wish there more of these kind of films made today . 
1 .  )  this movie was amazing !  i watched it while i was in the town next to the one where he grew up !  i went and saw the buildings that the story took place in .  overall ,  i loved this movie ,  one of jake gyllenhaal's best !  !  also- my favorite parts were the science fair ,  and all the times with his father .  they were so sad ,  it seemed .  homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad didn't seem to care one way or another .  that tag line is true .   " sometimes one dream is bright enough to light up the sky .  "  2 .  )  the way this movie was shot was impeccable ,  it was all so believable that it could have been recorded during the 1950's .  dress was accurate and they had their slang down too .  definitely recommend this movie ! 
 " october sky "  is a film that will steal your heart ,  fill your mind with vivid imagery ,  and lift your spirit .  the tale of homer hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first ,  especially when the film is set in a mining town ,  where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine .  but homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps .  with the encouragement of miss riley ,  ( a friendly teacher )  ,  members of his father's staff ,  and his friends ,  homer attempts to make his dream a reality .   yet as in any true to life story ,  there are many stops along the way .  director joe johnston lowers us into the coal mines ,  where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock .  with lit helmets and bent posture ,  they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness .  the hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work .   contrasting the mine shaft's lugubrious load are the images of homer and his friend's rocket launches .  underneath the blue bowl of sky ,  rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere .  .  . and nothing can match the scene when homer sees sputnik for the first time .   yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters .  homer's father is a classic hardened man .  .  . but he has a soft side as well .  we see that he does love his son ,  despite their many arguments .  the love and support of miss riley is evident as well .  best of all ,  the film is uncomfortable .  it doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow .  it tears at you ,  lifts you up .  it keeps an air of reality ,  which is important in a film like this .   this film can be considered a complete work .  at first ,  i was disappointed that the film did not continue with homer's life .  i didn't want it to end .  then i realized .  .  . that's what a good film does to a person .  if it has done its job ,  you won't want it to end .  and  " october sky "  accomplishes just that . 
this is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good !  even though some of the actors and actresses weren't very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old !  it was funny ,  gross and just all out a very good movie .  in most parts i just didn't know what was going to happen next !  i was like i think this is going to happen ,  wait i think this is going to happen .  all age groups will love this movie !  in some parts i couldn't stop laughing ,  it was so funny ,  but in some parts i was totally grossed out and i couldn't believe what i was seeing !  i am definitely going to see this movie again !  it is one of those movies where it can't get boring .  every time you see it is so suspenseful .  i definitely recommend seeing this movie !  ! 
so we compromised .  this was a fairly charming film ,  i liked the art direction  ( it felt far more  " real "  than most kids movies )  ,  and the costumes weren't too cutesy .  the child actors were not bad to watch  ( the adult performances trended toward cheesy )  .  it was great that they showed how a bullied kid bullies others as well as kids standing up to bullying .   i don't know how many grown ups would want to see this for themselves ,  but it's a great film to take a kid to .  and since  " barnyard "  was apparently attended by 100+ kids at the same time ,  i'm really glad we picked the sparsely attended showing of  " worms "  instead . 
let's keep it simple :  my two kids were glued to this movie .  it has its flaws from an adult perspective ,  but buy some jelly-worms and just enjoy it .    and the pepsi girl was excellent !   and kimberly williams was pretty gosh-darned hot ,  although she's not in the film very much ,  so don't get too excited there .   not that's it's really a bad thing ,  but it is the kind of movie you watch just once .  don't buy the dvd .   enjoy !   did i mention kimberly williams ?   ( that was for the dads .  ) 
i read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later i saw the movie .  there are a few differences :    1 . billy was oringinally suppose to eat 15 worms in 15 days ,  not 10 worms in one day by 7 : 00pm .   2 . billy is suppose to get 30 dollars after he's eaten all the worms .  in the movie after billy eats all the worms ,  joe has to go to school with worms in his pants .   3 .  joe is suppose to fake some of the worms but in the movie ,  he doesn't at all .   even though there are changes , this movie is still one that kids will enjoy . 
this is a good movie ,  a good family movie to watch if you have nothing else to do .  if you are expecting this movie to be word to word from the book ,  you will be very very disappointed .  i was somewhat disappointed because i read the book a few times when i was in elementary school .   this is about a new kid in town named billy .  he makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets .  billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins .   the acting is ok ,  probably the worst part of the movie .  the kid actors over exaggerate on many things .  they think it's apocalypse if billy does not eat the worms .  hallie eisenberg did a magnificent job ,  though .   the plot line is good as a movie ,  but it sucks as a book adaptation .  i was able to watch this movie without looking at the time .  .  .  . sometimes .   overall ,  this was a good family movie with some weak points .  i rate this movie 7/10 . 
saw this today with my 8 year old .  i thought it was cute .  i agree with the other poster that it wasn't anything like the book that i can remember ,  but we still enjoyed it .  all of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining .  billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day .  if he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants .  the beginning of the movie is set up to show that billy has a very weak stomach and pukes at almost anything .  hilarity ensues with a bunch of different way to cook the worms .  good message about standing up to bullies and of course ,  a sappy happy ending . 
vivah is in my book the best movie of 2006  !  period  !  !  .  in my book it is one of the best 100 movies ever made in bollywood .  its sad that this movie doesn't have that many reviews and isn't having that much popularity .    vivah is once again a true achievement from a director who does it again .  after hahk and maine pyar kiya sooraj has once again pulled off a brilliant one vivah .    this is the most simple and cute movies that i've seen this year .  after seeing don 2 which was crap and later dhoom 2 which even beat don in that matter ,  i finally see a movie which is so close to my heart and my culture .   i don't know why bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture which we have and are making hollywood remake style crap movies like dhoom 2 and don .    the story is beautiful and relates much to the indian system of arranged marriage which i too would like to be a part of .  our system which teaches us to obey elders ,  follow them and of course obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie !  .  of course there isn't any force in choosing your life partner and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and its up to them to decide as it is brilliantly shown in this movie .    coming back to the movie .  .  .  .  . vivah is a story of journey between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage .  the phase where the guy meets the girl  !  .  .  .  . both understand each other  .  . both try to assess if they could love each other for seven generations  ( as our system says )  and the various which occur during marriages .   amrita rao is brilliant in the movie .  .  .  .  .  .  . shahid is ok .  .  .  .  . and alok nath and anupam kher are awesome  !  !  the songs are brilliant .   !  i especially like the hamari shaadi main hafte reh gye chaar and do anjaane ajnabi  .  .  .  .  .  .   overall a must see for anyone who still believes in the indian culture and tradition and i certainly do  !  .   go see this movie .  .  .  .  .  . i just have to say one word .  .  .  .  .  .  .   bliss  !  . 
i really liked the movie .  i remember reading it several times as a kid and was glad to see a movie had been made about the book .   i was kid-sitting for a boy and a girl ,  ages 11 and 8 and had to talk the girl in to seeing the movie .  but happily ,  at the end ,  she was glad she saw it and even said that she wanted to buy it on dvd as soon as it came out .   there were some great laugh-out-loud moments and the movie was not as  " gross "  as i expected it would be  .  .  .  tho it did rank pretty high up there on the gross-o-meter  .  .  .   the only thing i cannot figure out is why they had to have the  " dilly "  line in there that was done by woody in reference to his private part  .  .  .  that to me was the only shocker moment  ( and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly gasp at that moment in the movie )   .  .  .  i have no clue why that was put in the movie ;  it added nothing to the actual movie except for that shock/gasp factor  .  .  .  other than that ,  a pretty good movie .  nice to see the  " pepsi "  girl all grown up . 
it's a weekend i've been watched this funny film .  and i really like it .  all the kids are cute ,  who remind me of my own childhood with those stupid thinking .  it's a real entertaining movie for a group of families at weekend night ,  which could make lots of memories and laughters .  kid's humor always work .  nice acting as well .  simple story but cool shooting .  nice job for directer to find the kid's way .  when it comes to the kid movie ,  i think of  " 12 and holding "  .  another one this year but differed aspect to the kid's world ,  which is real and cruel .  awesome work .  h2efw focuses on the happy side of childhood ,  which every kid and family need .  p . s .  twitch ,  i think ,  is the voice of nemo from  " finding nemo "  . 
it's a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their rollicking kids .  i felt like instead of a movie ticket ,  i should have been given a nambla membership .   based upon thomas rockwell's respected book ,  how to eat fried worms starts like any children's story :  moving to a new town .  the new kid ,  fifth grader billy forrester was once popular ,  but has to start anew .  making friends is never easy ,  especially when the only prospect is poindexter adam .  or erica ,  who at 4 1/2 feet ,  is a giant .   further complicating things is joe the bully .  his freckled face and sleeveless shirts are daunting .  he antagonizes kids with the death ring :  a crackerjack ring that is rumored to kill you if you're punched with it .  but not immediately .  no ,  the death ring unleashes a poison that kills you in the eight grade .   joe and his axis of evil welcome billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos .  once discovered ,  billy plays it cool ,  swearing that he eats worms all the time .  then he throws them at joe's face .  ewww !  to win them over ,  billy reluctantly bets that he can eat 10 worms .  fried ,  boiled ,  marinated in hot sauce ,  squashed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich .  each meal is dubbed an exotic name like the  " radioactive slime delight ,  "  in which the kids finally live out their dream of microwaving a living organism .   if you've ever met me ,  you'll know that i have an uncontrollably hearty laugh .  i felt like a creep erupting at a toddler whining that his  " dilly dick "  hurts .  but fried worms is wonderfully disgusting .  like a g-rated farrelly brothers film ,  it is both vomitous and delightful .   writer/director bob dolman is also a savvy storyteller .  to raise the stakes the worms must be consumed by 7 pm .  in addition billy holds a dark secret :  he has an ultra-sensitive stomach .   dolman also has a keen sense of perspective .  with such accuracy ,  he draws on children's insecurities and tendency to exaggerate mundane dilemmas .   if you were to hyperbolize this movie the way kids do their quandaries ,  you will see that it is essentially about war .  freedom-fighter and freedom-hater use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy wars ,  only to learn a valuable lesson in unity .  international leaders can learn a thing or two about global peacekeeping from fried worms .   at the end of the film ,  i was comforted when two chaperoning mothers behind me ,  looked at each other with befuddlement and agreed ,   " that was a great movie .  "  great ,  now i won't have to register myself in any lawful databases . 
i sat with my children as we watched this film .  we all found it to be a very entertaining movie .   when billy goes to a new school ,  a fifth grade bully starts stuff with him and this is what leads to the eating of worms .   a bet is made and billy has only so much time to eat 10 worms or else .  from this point the bully and his friends try to come up with nasty ways to cook ,  fry or bake the worms to try and get billy sick so that he will lose the bet .   billy stays strong and eats his way into becoming liked more and more by everyone ,  even the bullies friends .   i wont tell you if he wins the bet or not .  .  . you will just need to watch it to find out but i will think that if you like good family movies you will like this one .   p . s .  let me add that this movie is not just for boys ,  i have all daughters and they really liked it a lot . 
watching the commercials for this movie ,  i was fairly convinced that i was going to loathe it .  for one thing ,  it was one of those  " loosely based on the novel "  movies ,  which usually means that the book author saw the script ,  hated it ,  and refused to be associated with the film .  worse ,  the trailer showed only the most mundane slapstick imaginable  ( ex :  kid gets squirted in the face with a garden hose .  .  . and falls over )  .  so when my little brother got it into his mind that this was the  " must see "  film of the season  ( of course ,  he thought the same thing about  " cars "  ,   " over the hedge "  ,   " the ant bully "  ,   " monster house "  ,  etc ,  etc )  ,  i was admittedly less than thrilled .   but once at the theater ,  the film won me over for a variety of reasons .  first and foremost ,  the writers capture 'kid dialogue' better than just about any other children's film i've ever seen .  a prime example of this comes directly after the boys' principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg omelet .  the boys do a lame ,  over-exaggerated impression of the principal lecturing them ,  which makes it realistic since all little kids think  ( mistakenly )  that they do great mocking expressions of their adult tormentors .  then one of the boys asks ,   " why did he say ,  'alley oop' ?  "  another boy responds ,   " maybe he's crazy !  "  and the entire group laughs uproariously .  not an overly witty rejoinder ,  but exactly the kind of thing a young kid would come up with on the spot and exactly the type of remark other kids his age would find hilarious .  as if to confirm it ,  my kid brother laughed right on cue when they were spoken on-screen ;  i could practically hear his voice spouting the same exact lines if he was placed in a similar situation .   another reason the movie works is that the writers manage to work in issues like bullying ,  sibling relationships ,  the new kid in school ,  and peer pressure/conformity without making any of them seem as though they were subplots for some after school special .  for example ,  the bully  ( joe )  isn't stereotypical ;  he's definitely bad but not pure evil ,  and just enough of his home-life is revealed that the audience feels sympathy for him and understands his bullying origins .  there's also no  " cue the dramatic music "  moment where billy  ( 'worm boy' )  realizes what a complete tool he's being to his younger brother woody ,  and yet ,  by the end of the movie ,  some type of minor transformation has been made .  there's some realism here in the way the characters resolve situations and in the way they relate to each other ,  and very little of it comes across as corny .   the only drawback to the movie comes in the form of an absolutely laughable dance scene that even the creators of the infamous mcdonald's dance party in  " mac and me "  would scoff at .  why oh why was it put into the movie ?  ?  did austin rogers  ( adam )  pull a macaulay culkin and refuse to take the role unless he was given a vehicle to showcase his oh so impressive dancing skills ?  the entire sequence definitely did not need to be there and had slightly less comedic value than any given show on  " the history channel "  .   overall ,  though ,  this movie was excellent ,  and the length  ( about an hour and twenty minutes )  was just about perfect .  one of the best ,  most realistic live action kid films you'll ever see if you're ever around children or just remember what being a kid was actually like . 
~~i was able to see this movie yesterday morning on a early viewing pass~~  i am a mom of 2 children ,  who range from 11 down to 6 .  so i'm sure plenty of parents can relate to having to see many many  " kids "  movies .  this was refreshing for me .  i haven't read this particular book ,  so i don't know if it stayed true to the book or not .  but it sure took the grossness factor to a high level .  this is the story of the  " new "  kid in town and it just so happens that there are a group of boys who have formed a club of sorts and love to pick on kids  .  .  .  . sound familiar ?  haven't we all suffered this one time or another .  he has the little brother who he cant stand and parents that he is embarrassed about .  what i enjoyed most of all was seeing how each character was totally different from another they all stood out .  the bully  ( why do they always make the bully a red head ?  my daughter has red hair !  and she is no bully !  .  . lol )  is well a great bully ,  who finds himself being yelled at by his own big brother .  it took twists and turns and well you fall in love with all of them and really find yourself routing for all the characters !  even the parents ,  great connection between father and son .  all around enjoyable ,  sweet , funny ,  gross etc .  .  .  .  .  . take your kids !  !  !  you will enjoy it as much as they do ! 
after being forced to sit through some real stinkers  ( racing stripes ,  shark boy and lava girl )  -- i truly enjoyed watching  " fried worms "  .  for once ,  i did not guess the ending !  it was funny and entertaining and didn't resort to a ton of gross-out humor ,  despite the title .  my boys  ( 6 and 10 )  both loved it too -- oh and my 45 year old  " boy "  had a smile on his face the whole time .  this is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents .  the relationship with the little brother is so close to real life .   " he is not stopping singing just to annoy me !  !  "  also ,  the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is right-on with the way kids behave .  of course the parents have to act a little goofy -- but my favorite scenes involved the dad getting used to his new job .  have fun ! 
i thought the kids in the movie were great .  i deal with kids in that age group ,  and i thought their behaviors were very believable .  i did have a problem with the reference to the private parts made by the 5-year old .  i didn't think the comment was necessary and actually slightly lowered my opinion of the movie .    i think luke benward is up and coming star .  i would like to see more of him on the big screen .  i enjoyed his reactions to the situations that he found himself in .  often kids in this age group do things without thinking through the consequences .  almost all of the actors did this throughout the movie .   i also think the message of bullying needs to be examined more in movies with this age group .  it is a major problem in schools today .   the ending was quite unexpected .  billy's thoughts on whether he won or didn't win the bet were very surprising .  how he handled that situation was excellent .  too often today kids are not willing to compromise .  the actors in this movie showed that compromise is an important part of life . 
if you like films about school bullies ,  brave children ,  hilarious toddlers and worm eating ,  then how to eat fried worms will appeal to you .   the film is about a boy named billy ,  who when arriving on his first day at a new school ,  discovers that some of his classmates have played a prank on him by putting worms into his lunch .  the school bully ,  joe and his  " team "  of friends start teasing billy and calling him  " worm boy "  .   billy decides to play along by saying that  " he eats worms all the time "  .  joe and his friends don't believe him but billy assures them and bets joe that he can eat ten worms in one day otherwise he will come to school with worms in his pants .   the boys take billy up on his bet ,  leaving the weak stomached child with a mission to gain respect from his classmates by eating worms cooked ,  fried ,  or alive .   the film may sound gross but there are a lot of messages in it .  for one ,  it portrays true friendship and how to accept people for who they are .  it also shows you why some bullies resort to bullying other children .   the film's protagonist ,  billy is a strong minded and brave person who all of us can relate to .  it is easy to empathize with him as we silently cheer for him to reach his goal ,  even though we might not always agree with what he's doing or the choices he makes .   the children in the film are portrayed exactly how children are in real life and the film deserves a lot of credit for that .  the child actors are the stars of this show ,  showing true emotion and feeling than most other children's movies portray .   some adults may not enjoy this film but kids will ,  perhaps even teenagers .   there are hardly any other good movies on circuit at the moment ,  so if you're not in the mood to see snakes on a plane ,  try worms on a plate in how to eat fried worms .  it is a feel good fun film and not just fear factor for kids . 
it started out slow after an excellent animated intro ,  as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop .  once the bet is on ,  though ,  the movie picks up the pace as it's a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm .  we had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son :  bullies ,  helping others ,  mind over matter when you don't want to do something .   of special note is the girl who played erica  ( erk )  :  hallie kate eisenberg .  the director kinda sneaks her in unexpectedly ,  and when she is on-screen she is captivating .  she's one of those  " hey ,  she looks familiar "  faces ,  and then i remembered that she was the little girl that pepsi featured about 8 years ago .  she was also in  " paulie "  ,  that movie about the parrot who tries to find his way home .   ms .  eisenberg made many tv and movie appearances in '99-00 ,  but then was not seen much for the next few years .  she's now 14 and is growing up to be a beautiful woman .  her smile really warms up the screen .  if she can get some more good roles she could have as good a career  ( or better ?  )  than haley joel osment ,  another three named kid actor ,  but hopefully without some of the problems that osment has been in lately .   anywhozitz ,  according to my 8 y . o .  son ,  who just finished reading the story ,  the film did not seem to follow the book all that well ,  but was entertaining none the less .  the ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels  ( how to eat boiled slugs ?  escargot kid's style ?  )  ,  which might not be such a bad thing .  it was nice to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language ,  violence or sex scenes .   one other good aspect of the movie was the respect/fear engendered by the principal mr .  burdock  ( boilerplate )  .  movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons .  while he has one particular goofy scene ,  he ruled the school with a firm hand .  it was also nice to see andrea martin getting some work . 
pre-adolescent humor is present in large quantities .  the acting and story are wonderful if you can stomach the concept .  those with weak constitutions will have some difficulty since the  " worms "  are realistic enough to cause churning of more than a few in the audience .   tom cavanagh and hallie kate eisenberg stole the spotlight ,  but the young ty panitz could get some serious time on screen over the next few years .   miss eisenberg has developed from a cute face into a strong young actress with charm and wonderful comic delivery .    the story does a spectacular job in dealing with bullying ,  friendship ,  and fairness .  it creates an opportunity to discuss these topics in an open and frank manner while recalling some  " gross "  scene from the film . 
i remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now .  i knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day !  we rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare .  wasn't necessary .  the only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters' first name ,  the fact that there is a bet ,  and a whole lot of worm eating .  oh yeah ,  i almost forgot ,  the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent .  how the kids know each other ,  the number of kids involved ,  how the bet came about ,  the number of worms that must be eaten ,  the time frame in which he has to eat the worms ,  how they are cooked ,  progression of friendships ,  climax scenes ,  etc .  ,  nothing is the same .  but somehow ,  it did not ruin the movie for me .  the characters are all enjoyable ,  and the film did not leave me disappointed .  word of caution for parents ,  there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when billy's little brother referred to his penis as a  " dilly dick "  .  the embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us ,   " does anybody know what a dilly dick is ?  "  lol .  that and an occasional  " shut up "  is as foul mouthed as this film gets .  my daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4  ( and was holding the empty nacho container just in case )  but was fine by worm 6 .  she and i both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience . 
my wife and i took our 13 year old son to see this film and were absolutely delighted with the winsome fun of the film .  it has extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood ,  but even women enjoy the film and especially hallie kate eisenberg's refrain ,   " boys are so weird .  "  it's refreshing to see a film that unapologetically shows that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup .  boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers silly !  we enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend ,  myself and my daughters 23 year old boyfriend went to see the movie the next day for a guys day out .  we had even more fun the second time around and everyone raved about it .  it's clean and delightfully acted by a pre-adolescent cast reminiscent of the tv classic  " freaks and geeks "  .  we all feel it will become a sleeper hit not unlike the  " freaks & geeks "  which didn't survive its first season but sold-out its dvd release .  do see it especially if you have boys and you'll find it stimulates conversation about fun and safety !  girls will love it because of the opportunity it affords to say ,   " boys are so weird !  "  don't miss it .  .  . 
the show is really funny .  nice theme .  jokes and one liners are really good .  with little extra tuning it can become a very popular show .  but the only major negative point of this show is the cast .  david spade does a great job as russell ,  megyn price does a good job .  but who the hell did cast patrick warburton ,  oliver hudson and bianca kajlich .   technically russell and jeff are the main characters of the show ,  which make viewers wanna watch the show .  russell is a playboy and jeff is a kind of frustrated family man ,  the relationship wiz .  .  .  with an experience of all the problems a married couple face in a relationship .   patrick warburton - does a horrible job as jeff ,  he is not at all suited for the role .  he is like a robot ,  literally there is no punch in his dialog delivery .    cast is really very important for viewers to like it .  the bad acting certainly will take the show downhill .  .  . 
i missed almost all of the first season ,  but when the other shows went to reruns ,  i started watching .  i ended up buying the entire first season off itunes .  this is now one of my favorite comedy shows .  patrick warburton is the key .  his dry sense of humor has me rolling all the time .  david spade is funny ,  but sometimes a little russell goes a long way .  i enjoy the other cast members more  ( but not saying he doesn't add to the show )  .   do yourself a favor .  if you haven't checked this one out ,  give it a try .  if you can catch the episode where  " jeff "  goes to the sperm bank ,  you will see how good this show is .   i hope this series has a long run . 
this would have to be one of the funniest tv sitcoms to come out of the states since the demise of  " everybody loves raymond "  .  warburton is always hilarious ,  and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection .  david spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines .  after having raved over the british series ,   " coupling "  i can see from just where the creators of  " rules of engagement "  got their original idea ,  but this is not intended as being a  " brickbat "  - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart .  but it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series ,  particularly in the very difficult field of comedy .  having been a part of a professional tv comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in australia ,  i can appreciate particularly ,  the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew .  one of the few grievances i have with the series is the very obviously  " canned "  laughter .  surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series . 
i really enjoyed the pilot ,  it was as amazing as i hoped it would be ,  if not better .  patrick warburton was a riot ,  although at first i thought that i wouldn't be able to stand his character .  him and megyn price had little chemistry at all ,  but hopefully as the season goes on they'll get more comfortable around each other .  it must have been weird for megyn to go from being the star on her last show [ " grounded for life " ] to being a co-star .    bianca kajlich and oliver hudson seem really new to the whole sitcom scene ,  but i think in time they'll get better .  david spade's character ,  to my surprise ,  wasn't the whole focus of this pilot .  the way he delivers his lines is so different from anyone else i've ever seen on tv ,  but i think that it is just his style .  it works for him .   i think that couples ,  or even singles ,  will be able to relate to all the doubts and fights and being unsure about your decisions ,  that this show is about .  all the situations that the characters are put in just feel like real life ,  not sugar-coated like most shows .   i hope for all the actors sakes that cbs gives them a chance .  this show has the potential to be one of the best series ,  if just given the chance and time . 
generally speaking ,  the plot was much better than i was expecting .  the laugh track was a bit annoying at times and did tend to get in the way ;  however ,  there were enough real chuckles in this episode to make up for it .  my biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown in the trailers .  spade ,  in particular ,  was not presented in the best light in the earlier promotions ,  but his character comes across quite well in the pilot .  there is is enough eye-candy to please almost anyone and all the regular characters seem up to the task ahead of them .  now ,  if the writers can just live up to what they have begun . 
this movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional indian values which are being replaced by western ones . its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around . shahid kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with amrita rao who is also very desi and she also acts pretty well .  .  . the genre of the movie is the same as hahk and such movies deserve to be made in india for the revival of old traditional values .  .  . the movies doesn't get 10 as it isn't very good at music which counts a lot in every movie , besides this it is flawless .  .  .  . 
this show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship .  as a man married for 26 years ,  i empathize with patrick warburton's character :  he loves his wife ,  but he assumes she knows that .  i also enjoy his monotone delivery ;  never gets too excited or too low .  a nice ensemble of characters .  this will be a nice addition to the monday night line-up .   i don't know how david spade will be in his role .  he is best enjoyed in small doses .  he also seems a little old to still be trolling for women .   i enjoyed the pilot and i look forward to seeing how the series develops . 
yeah ,  the poster is quite a horrible piece of work .   i thought the movie was ok .  .  . nothing really outstanding .  .  . i just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life .   ahh ,  but that can't happen to rich kids now can it ?  not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansion .   no .  .  . the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed .  after all ,  who will drive the brand new suv and who will go to law school ?    ah ,  the poor little rich kids .  .  . in their quaint pretty house ,  with their ivy league schools ,  ultra clean homes and socialite parties .  .  . what will the world do without them ?    i hope they all get addicted to drugs ,  pass-away their life and end up in jail .  .  . so maybe we can see movies that don't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world . 
maybe i need to have my head examined , but i thought this was a pretty good movie . the cg is not too bad . i have seen worse . the look of the creatures ( and by creatures i mean the good and the bad snake ) was pretty cool . the action scenes involving the snakes was really good , i thought . there are some lapses in logic at times , and the story doesn't always make sense . but for a creature feature , there are a lot worse . a lot of the other creatures seemed lifted from other movies , so it's not wholly original . i think the gist of the story is original though . there is a bit of similarity to godzilla ( the big budget american version ) which liked a lot . i didn't like this movie as much , but i still say it was pretty good . i also liked the music . all in all , i think dragon wars is about a 7/10
if you like sci-fi ,  monsters ,  and ancient legends ,  then you will love this movie !  !    the special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago .  while the acting may have been a little less than desirable ,  the story line and effects adequately compensated for it .   i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen tv .   if you like non-stop action ,  awesome visuals ,  and taste for myth and lore .  .  .  . you have to see this movie !  ! 
i have never seen such a movie before .  i was on the edge of my seat and constantly laughing throughout the entire movie .  i never thought such horrible acting existed it was all just too funny .  the story behind the movie is decent but the movies scenes fail to portray them .  i have never seen such a stupid movie in my life which is why it i think its worth watching .  i give this movie 10 out of 10 for being the most pathetic movie ever created ,  this movie seems like it was solely created to become trash .  i mean the scenes seem so fake and the actors act like  " the camera is in front of them "  .  you will get a kick just watching how lame this movie is ,  me and my friend could not stop making jokes during the movie ,  the darthvader guy who tries to get the girl got ran over not once but twice and the second time he got ran over it sounded like he said sh ! # although he doesn't speak english lol .  if you watch this movie you will think to yourself that all those other movies you didn't like you took for granted they are way better than this .  this movie should be seen out of curiosity as well as what kind of movie defines lame .  the evil serpent encountered the girl so many times it was ridiculous ,  the evil serpent just roared and roared and let her get away every time .  the evil serpent had so many chances it was like god was trying to say hurry up and eat the girl how many miracles do you want .  the transition between scenes leaves you wondering did i miss something ?  so many plot holes from scene to scene .  i was laughing like crazy when they decided to  " escape to mexico "  to get away from the serpent .  hmmmm hopping the border will save you from a serpent from korea ?  interesting .  .  .  very interesting .  .  .  .  i guess hopping the border solves all problems .  another scene that completely stupified me .  .  they met for the first time and had a romantic scene at the beach they kissed and didn't even know each other .  .  .  the scene was so clichéd and the was no substance at least in other movies it might seem logical afterwhile but i mean they just met even though they are reincarnations there feelings were like they instantly loved each other instead of it rather developing .  anyways this movie is worth watching for the sake of opening your eyes and seeing the light .  bad hollywood movies will seem like heaven when compared to this .  in the end its worth watching you wont get bored you will be occupied criticizing every moment ,  every scene in your head . 
i enjoyed this movie and i had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews i read before going .  i went because i was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the postings were so angry with this movie and with the koreans .  oh and it's from korea which has put out some of my favorite movies .  i liked host but not my absolute favorite .  some of my favorite sci-fi /fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste :  mirrormask ,  stardust ,  serenity ,  gattaca ,  willow ,  matrix ,  resident evil series ,  lotr ,  stargate ,  dark city .   it wasn't confusing like everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles great .  there are some holes in the story but didn't really matter .  i sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when i see summer blockbusters .  the korean legend was interesting ,  the reincarnation stuff was different ,  and i thought the main characters suspiciously dressed like korean actors in other shows .  ethan's ( behr ) hair looked so asian .   yes ,  it could be better and i hope in the future that korea ,  with its unusual quirky sense of life ,  intense emotions ,  and unexpected humor ,  can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre .  maybe a combination of host and dragon wars in the future ? 
yes ,  some people have said that this movie was a waste of money ,  but i'm the kind of die hard dragon/world-ending/holy crap action movie fan .   but if you take it from my stand point this movie had some of the best action sences were pretty dang good .  but its that kind of movie that everything just fell tougher at the right time ,  or just about when evil was trumph something fell in to save them at the right time .  though there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie which surprised me .   the 3d graphics were pretty damn good .  i mean for this kind of movie the 3d effects were great !  !  !  !  big battle that was shown in the trailers live up to whatever hype the movie had .  the fight between good and evil at the end was ,  i have to to say could have been longer and slightly better ,  it was still pretty good .   now on to the parts that i think could have been better .  the beginning was pretty good showing the parts that lead up to the big battles .  i mean if you don't really want to go see this movie in theaters then at least this is a dvder .  .  .   overall i loved the movie , but the plot just fell into place to fast and fit tougher just to well . 
i see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in august ,  though the movie was not released in the us ,  at least ,  until the middle of september .  maybe these are unhappy expats living in s .  korea who saw it early .  i am in the us and just saw it today .  i thought the special effects were excellent ,  better than the trailer .  the story was non-western ,  but i think we are all used to this from many other movies .  it wasn't at all hard to follow .  the acting by the leads was weak ,  but other people were quite good .  there was humor throughout ,  too .  i rated it at 8 because i had a good time watching it ,  which is what i went for . 
if you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated ,  you'll enjoy d-war .  if you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films ,  you'll enjoy d-war .  otherwise ,  don't bother !  i saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends .  they really loved it and that made me feel good .  after the movie was over ,  all the kids ( my nephews and their friends ) could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater .   the cg is good .  acting and directing are horrible .  storyline is extremely simple .  but ,  since the half of the audience was kids ,  they were screaming ,  shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen .  this made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been .   it's a good movie to take your kids to ,  but except for the final battle sequence ,  d-war is disappointing .  i give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much . 
saxophonist ronnie bowers  ( dick powell )  wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood .  he stays at hollywwod hotel  ( of course )  .  at the same time big egotistical star mona marshall  ( lola lane )  has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture .  in a panic the studio hires lookalike virginia  ( rosemary lane )  to impersonate her and have bowers take her to the premiere not telling him it's not marshall .  naturally they fall in love .  you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself .   the plot is old  ( to put it nicely )  but powell and rosemary lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices .  the score is good  ( highlighted by  " hooray for hollywood "  )  and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive-in musical sequence  ( with edgar kennedy doing his patented slow burn )  .  also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as monas sister jonesie .   still the movie isn't that good .  the rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny .  lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play mona for comedy .  also there is racism--a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there's some truly appalling racist  " humor "  at one point .  that's probably what keeps this off tv most of the time .  i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today .   all in all a so-so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs .  i give it a 7 . 
when we talk hollywood hotel we could be talking about one of three things ,  the actual hotel ,  the radio program ,  and this film which was partially inspired by the first two .  dick powell was the host of the hollywood hotel program on cbs radio network in which louella parsons dished out the weekly scoop on the stars .   powell and parsons debuted the hollywood hotel program in 1934 so by 1937 it had its fair share of the radio audience .  powell hosted ,  sang ,  and kibitzed with louella and her movie star guests .  with the power she had with her column ,  she was able to get the various stars to go on and plug their latest films for nothing .   then the american federation of radio artists stepped in and demanded she pay wages accordingly and they won the case .  that ended the hollywood hotel program in 1938 .  of course both powell and louella went on to other radio venues .  the whole story is covered in the tony thomas book ,  the films of dick powell .   but before the plug was pulled this film came out from powell's home studio of warner brothers inspired by the radio program .  powell plays a singer/saxophonist with the benny goodman band who gets signed to a hollywood contract .  but when he gets out to hollywood he gets himself tangled up with an egotistical film star lola lane ,  her lookalike double real life sister rosemary lane ,  and a ham actor in alan mowbray .   when mowbray is called upon to sing in a civil war epic he's making with lola lane ,  it's powell's voice they use .  then mowbray develops a lina lamont problem when he's asked to go on the hollywood hotel radio program ,  broadcast from the hollywood hotel .  that's got the studio in a tizzy .  let's say the problem isn't solved the way it is singing in the rain ,  but powell's manager ted healy proves to be resourceful .   richard whiting and johnny mercer provide a really nice score for the film .  the big hit song comes right at the beginning as the benny goodman band with scat singing johnnie davis sing hollywood's anthem ,  hooray for hollywood .  my favorite however is powell and rosemary lane singing ,  i'm like a fish out of water .  just listening to johnny mercer's lyrics about ginger rogers running the brooklyn dodgers or sally rand without her fan ,  it's a compendium of american popular culture in the thirties .   busby berkeley does the choreography here and while the film doesn't have the soaring imaginary stuff that his earlier work with warner brothers has ,  the numbers are well staged .  berkeley's big moment is in a drive-in eatery where powell and healy have been forced to take jobs .  the number starts with benny goodman broadcasting from the hollywood hotel doing let that be a lesson to you and then at the drive-in powell ,  lane and the entire place start joining in song to the exasperation of owner edgar kennedy .  and you know what you can expect from edgar kennedy exasperation .   benny goodman gets to show why he was named the king of swing when the band with drummer gene krupa and xylophonist lionel hampton as part of his ensemble .  that together with frances langford singing as well .  and possibly the last surviving cast member of the group was a fellow who had a small bit as a radio announcer .  he died in 2004 ,  but not before he became the 40th president of the united states .  ronald reagan always credited dick powell and pat o'brien as being the two guys on warner brothers who were the most helpful to an eager young player looking to make his mark .   hollywood hotel is one delightful and entertaining motion picture ,  dated ,  but charmingly so . 
i can't believe currently this movie is rated a 6 . 9 .  anyway this movie was probably one of the most touching real indian movies i have ever seen .  it was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema .  as for the story i thought it was great it was about shahid kapur being set up on an arranged marriage with amrita rao .  he is kind of a happy go lucky kind of guy ,  while amrita rao is a traditional indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is her cousin doesn't seem to get as much attention as she does so her aunt dislikes amrita with a passion .  this upsets amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her .  it was also very touching to see that although amrita's family wasn't that rich maybe just middle class to lower class ,  while shahids family was quite upper class ,  they still treated their family with respect and didn't even ask put them down which really struck a nerve with me .  this is because i've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow .  this movie showed that shahids family was willing to look at the great values that amrita had been brought up with and turned a blind eye to the fact she wasn't a rich business tycoons daughter or anything .  all in all this movie deserved an 8/10 i wish more and more of these kind of movies were made . 
 " hollywood hotel "  has relationships to many films like  " ella cinders "  and  " merton of the movies "  about someone winning a contest including a contract to make films in hollywood ,  only to find the road to stardom either paved with pitfalls or non-existent .  in fact ,  as i was watching it tonight ,  on turner classic movies ,  i was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic  " singing in the rain "  may have taken some of their ideas from  " hollywood hotel "  ,  most notably a temperamental leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by mouthing along on screen .    " hollywood hotel "  is a fascinating example of movie making in the 1930s .  among the supporting players is louella parsons ,  playing herself  ( and ,  despite some negative comments i've seen ,  she has a very ingratiating personality on screen and a natural command of her lines )  .  she is not the only real person in the script .  make-up specialist perc westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble another .   this film also was one of the first in the career of young mr .  ronald reagan ,  playing a radio interviewer at a movie premiere .  reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes - particularly when he realizes that nobody dick powell is about to take over the microphone when it should be used with more important people .   dick powell has won a hollywood contract in a contest ,  and is leaving his job as a saxophonist in benny goodman's band .  the beginning of this film ,  by the way ,  is quite impressive ,  as the band drives in a parade of trucks to give a proper goodbye to powell .  they end up singing  " hooray for hollywood "  .  the interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose .  throughout the johnny mercer lyrics are references to such hollywood as max factor the make-up king ,  rin tin tin ,  and even a hint of tarzan .  but the original song lyric referred to looking like tyrone power .  obviously jack warner and his brothers were not going to advertise the leading man of 20th century fox ,  and the name donald duck was substituted .  in any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of goodman's orchestra at their best .  so did a later five minute section of the film ,  where the band is rehearsing .   powell leaves the band and his girl friend  ( frances langford )  and goes to hollywood ,  only to find he is a contract player  ( most likely for musicals involving saxophonists )  .  he is met by allen joslyn ,  the publicist of the studio  ( the owner is grant mitchell )  .  joslyn is not a bad fellow ,  but he is busy and he tends to slough off people unless it is necessary to speak to them .  he parks powell at a room at the hollywood hotel ,  which is also where the studio's temperamental star  ( lola lane )  lives with her father  ( hugh herbert )  ,  her sister  ( mabel todd )  ,  and her sensible if cynical assistant  ( glenda farrell )  .  lane is like jean hagen in  " singing in the rain "  ,  except her speaking voice is good .  her version of  " dan lockwood "  is one  " alexander dupre "   ( alan mowbray ,  scene stealing with ease several times )  .  the only difference is that mowbray is not a nice guy like gene kelly was ,  and lane  ( when not wrapped up in her ego )  is fully aware of it .  having a fit on being by-passed for an out-of-the ordinary role she wanted ,  she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film .  joslyn finds a double for her  ( lola's real life sister rosemary lane )  ,  and rosemary is made up to play the star at the premiere and the follow-up party .  but she attends with powell  ( joslyn wanting someone who doesn't know the real lola )  .  this leads to powell knocking down mowbray when the latter makes a pest of himself .  but otherwise the evening is a success ,  and when the two are together they start finding each other attractive .   the complications deal with lola coming back and slapping powell in the face ,  after mowbray complains he was attacked by powell  (  " and his gang of hoodlums "  )  .  powell's contract is bought out .  working with photographer turned agent ted healey  ( actually not too bad in this film - he even tries to do a jolson imitation at one point )  ,  the two try to find work ,  ending up as employees at a hamburger stand run by bad tempered edgar kennedy  ( the number of broken dishes and singing customers in the restaurant give edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto )  .  eventually powell gets a  " break "  by being hired to be dupre's singing voice in a rip-off of  " gone with the wind "  .  this leads to the final section of the film ,  when rosemary lane ,  herbert ,  and healey help give powell his chance to show it's his voice ,  not mowbrays .   it's quite a cute and appealing film even now .  the worst aspects are due to it's time .  several jokes concerning african-americans are no longer tolerable  ( while trying to photograph powell as he arrives in hollywood ,  healey accidentally photographs a porter ,  and mentions to joslyn to watch out ,  powell photographs too darkly - get the point ?  )  .  also a bit with curt bois as a fashion designer for lola lane ,  who is  ( shall we say )  too high strung is not very tolerable either .  herbert's  " hoo-hoo " ing is a bit much  ( too much of the time )  but it was really popular in 1937 .  and an incident where healey nearly gets into a brawl at the premiere  ( this was one of his last films )  reminds people of the tragic ,  still mysterious end of the comedian in december 1937 .  but most of the film is quite good ,  and won't disappoint the viewer in 2008 . 
 " hollywood hotel "  is a fast-moving ,  exuberant ,  wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from warners which is sadly overlooked .  it should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of tinseltown --  " hooray for hollywood .  "  the score by richard whiting and johnny mercer has a number of other gems ,  however ,  including the charming  " i'm like a fish out of water ,  "  and  " silhouetted in the moonlight .  "  the best musical number is  " let that be a lesson to you ,  "  in which dick powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves  " behind the eight-ball ,  "  a fate which literally befalls slow-burning edgar kennedy at the number's end .  the picture celebrates hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once ,  as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego-maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives .  the cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians--allyn joslyn as a crafty press agent ,  ted healy as dick powell's would-be manager ,  fritz feld as an excitable restaurant patron ,  glenda farrell as mona marshall's sarcastic gal friday ,  edgar kennedy as a put-upon drive-in manager ,  mabel todd as mona's goofy sister ,  and hugh herbert as her even goofier dad .  the  " racist "  element mentioned in another review here is a ten-second bit where herbert appears in black-face during a pseudo- " gone with the wind "  sequence .  it's in questionable taste ,  but it shouldn't prevent you from seeing the other delights in this film ,  notably the benny goodman quartet  ( including teddy wilson and lionel hampton !  )  in what i believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo .  the  " dark eyes "  sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late ,  but otherwise  " hollywood hotel "  is a gem ,  well worth your time and certainly a film which should be considered for dvd release . 
a fabulous film .  with everything you could want in a film .  huge battle scenes and lots of other action .  suspense ,  and a romantic love story .    kind of like an old swashbuckler film .  totally entertaining from start to finish .    the editing was fast and you are never bored for a second .  the story is like a classic story of trouble in the royal household .  the actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent .  the costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative .  the special effects are amazing too .   gary stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at .  he looks like a sure bet for super stardom .    john rhys-davies is wonderful as he usually is .  he is one of the great actors of our time .   and cindy burbridge ,  ex miss thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady ,  even doing an english accent with remarkable success .    i found out that the film has won numerous awards ,  and i can see why .   all in all this is an amazing independent film .  see it for sure .    i highly recommend it .  and give it a ten + !  !  ! 
i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction .  the way it shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is very interesting .  .  . the portuguese ,  the japanese ,  and the various communities being managed by the king .  the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason .  the wardrobe is fine .  the film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production .  the scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting .  it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective . 
i am the parent of a special needs child and i enjoyed the the movie very much !  it was loving ,  warm and fun .  i learned a long time ago to see the humor in things .  i especially thought it was sweet how all the other characters worried about frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died .  i attended a focus screening of the film with other parents and siblings of special needs children before the film was edited .  everyone enjoyed the film and it actually inspired wonderful discussions .  we talked about how our kids make us laugh and we also talked about how we worry about them .  the screenwriter talked about how she work with autistic children and other special needs children as a volunteer for several years .  she based the character on a real person .  our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has gotten us through some very stressful times .  i give the movie two thumbs up !  !  ! 
i saw this independent film when it was in philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise .  i left the theater with a smile on my face .  one of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story -hilarious !  it has some great character actors in it too .  mindy sterling is in it and is very good .  i loved her in austin powers .  howard hesseman is also terrific .  i remember him from head of the class .  i am tired of all the dark edgy movies that keep getting made .  this is fun and light ,  and i can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed .  i keep checking to see when it will come out on dvd .  i will definitely buy it . 
a charming ,  funny film that gets a solid grade all around .  i saw a screener of this film recently at work .  it was so nice to see this film in contrast with all the crappy horror movies i see every day .  so much so ,  that i figured i'd write in .  not sure if this film is going to theaters ,  but i hope it does .  its a nice film to see with friends ,  its a charmer ,  and has some funny jokes .  the acting was terrific  ( especially howard hessman and larry dorf .  the directing was pretty good  ( not a film that needed to be over-directed )  .  what really makes this film stand out i think is the writing .  it was like neil simon ,  seinfeldish ,  and the banter between characters is smart and has a nice rhythm .  as an aspiring screenwriter ,  i notice those things !   ( i'm a dork )  .  anyway ,  a really cute film that i recommend . 
adorable !  i saw domestic import in philly in october with my kids .  we all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents .  i haven't heard them laugh like that in years !  it was the first time that i can remember seeing a movie that my parents and my kids could enjoy .  it's really cute and we can't wait for it to come out on dvd .  they need to make more movies like domestic import .  it is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy  ( and not be embarrassed )  .  i have not seen a movie this cute since my big fat greek wedding .  i loved mindy sterling as the mother .  she was also in austin powers .  howard hesseman is in this too and he is hilarious .  i remember him from wkrp . 
i gave this movie such a high mark because it was really cute ,  really funny ,  all while being unpretentious .  i went to see this film when it was playing in the philly area ,  and it was the centerpiece of a great night out with friends .  the film is well written and well acted ,  and though it does feel a bit like a sitcom rather then a movie ,  that doesn't take away from the film .  you just don't find comedies like this anymore ,  where you don't have to shock people to be funny .  the film centers around a ukranian housekeeper that finds herself working for a young couple in need of help .  though at first she helps ,  soon she adds more craziness to their lives then the couple bargained for .  things get further and further out of control until .  .  .  . you'll have to see !  the banter had me laughing ,  even after leaving the theater .  this film just put me in a good mood .  i can't wait until it is released on dvd because i want this movie in my collection . 
domestic import was a great movie .  i laughed the whole time .  it was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations .  the acting was great .  alla korot ,  larry dorf ,  howard hesseman ,  and all the others did an awesome job .  because it is an independent film written by a first-time writer ,  it doesn't have the clichés that are expected of other comedies ,  which was such a relief .  it was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart-warming story .  i heard it was based on a true story ?  if so ,  then that is hilarious  ( and amazing !  )  .  i highly recommend this movie . 
i liked this movies .  its a another yash raj film which you know will look good on screen ,  all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice .  .  .  another rule of yash raj's film is that either hero or heroine ; s have only one or none parent .  think back to all of those films .  .  mpk suman didn't have mom ,  hmapk salman didn't have parents ,  and final rule is that you are 90% likely to see alock nath crying .  .  .   the film is good too .  its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained .  there is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough .  the little kid  ( hero's nephew )  is well placed and deliver very good one liners .  the actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn't get that in real life .  this film doesn't have massively big happy families living in big house which i thou was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films .  there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film .  there isn't a strong message from this film but its a good watch .  if you are married  ( arranged marriage ) the film will remind you of what you went through .  and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you  .  .  .   overall a very good looking film .  no big plots or twists but a very gentle film ,  very much like bollywood classic . 
a pure reality bytes film .  fragile ,  beautiful and amazing first film of the director .  represented spain on the berlinale 2002 .  some people has compared the grammar of the film with almodovar's films .  .  . well ,  that shouldn't be a problem .  .  . 
spanish films are into a ,  if not golden ,  definitely a silver age .  piédras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflicts seriously .  although the feelings are strong or nearly at life or death-level ,  they still aren't really melodramatic .  this could happen .   there are different stories here ,  which become connected .  one is about the retarded girl ,  who doesn't dare to pass the street to the next block .  one is about the middle-aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetischist .  another is about the girl with drug problems who's lover leaves her .  still another one is about the madame of a brothel who  ( almost )  finds true love .   definitely worth seeing .  it's in spain the moviemakers take women seriously . 
it is nice to see suraj barjatya back at what he is best at . a story woven around a marriage . it feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene which you would avoid watching with your family .  though the story is simple and does not contain any new elements , you still like the movie , because of the presentation ,  performances , and actually the over all treatment .  hats off to suraj .  .  the movie is about the fact that engagement leads to love .  the depiction of the changes in the way of thinking , behaving once you get engaged is excellent .  director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfection . though the movie is slow , you don't mind it , because you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just wanna continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple .  as a typical rajshree stuff it has many sentimental scenes which are highly likely to make viewer burst into tears ( specially ladies )  .  but when you come out of the cinema hall you are very much satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth  : - )  . 
the movie begins a with mentally-challenged girl with bright yellow sneakers looking skyward on a madrid street corner and being spellbound by a passing plane .  the movie examines the life of five womenadela ,  leire ,  maricarmen ,  anita & isabelwho have completely different lives and choices of shoes .  their shoes is the first superficial ,  yet affixed with some glancing meaning ,  clue we get at their fragile identities .  in a theatrically embroidered and embellished way ,  a podiatrist tries to esoterically reveal the deepest secrets of a woman's souls by the sole of her feet .  the premise is risky and slightly contrived ,  but the tone and depth of the movie takes a daring plunge for the good .   what may have been light-hearted and superficial ,  quickly switches gear with the a superb dysfunctional couple scene that leaves the viewer riveted for minutes ,  seeing the love or lack thereof ,  the pain ,  the confusion ,  the hope ,  the needs and escape mechanisms develop through minutes different rooms of the house and down to the street and eventually below .  .  .  what a scene  (  !  )   ,  but there will be others as effective to follow and strengthen the strong characterization and directing displayed in this slice of life affair .   moving along ,  a woman has lost the husband she loved and inherited his kids and his taxi ,  while another has completely lost her husband emotionally ,  sexually ,  intellectually ,  but not physically .  a ghost ,  a pending divorce reproach ,  regret & remorse .  a new love ?  can you love a mirage ?  can you love the person in the mirror ?  can you love someone you can't love ?  or think you can't love ?  can you love and live life even though it will always be somewhat hopeless ?  yet isn't it exactly these hopes and dreams that keep us here grounded and in a spectrum of relative happiness ?  a lot of deep themes emerge and the final act brings people and ideas together to coalesce in an existential crisis with no clear cut solution ,  definitive decision or effective healing .  maybe a elusive thought ,  a fleeting feeling ,  but a lasting appreciation of life and of the artistry and intellect of the film .  live .  live again .  rewind the reel .  unveil the real ,  the important ;  the big stones  ( piedras )  of life .  the rest is just details . 
i saw this movie at the 18th haifa film festival ,  and it is one of the best i've seen this year .  seeing it on a big screen  ( and i mean big ,  not one of those tv screens most cinemas have )  with an excellent sound system always enhance the cinematic experience ,  as the movie takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you into the story ,  into the picture .   the movie presents a set of characters ,  which are loosely inter-connected .  their stories cross at certain points ,  and the multiplicity of story lines reminded me very much of the great robert altman and his exquisite films .  but the true hero of the movie is obviously the city of madrid ,  which provides the backdrop for the entire movie .  it houses the characters ,  contains the pavements and roads on which they walk ,  and sets the background atmosphere for all the events ,  all in beautifully filmed scenes .   the movie returns again and again to certain themes  ( shoes ,  for instance )  ,  and in essence salazar makes his metaphores more and more understandable to the viewer as the movie progresses .  he combines the views of the city with the shots of the characters ,  and elegantly matches the feeling of the scene to the background .  a set of talented actors helps him portrait a wide variety of characters .  one excellent example is the scene in which juaquin takes anita across the street for the first time .  it might not work on a small screen ,  but it gave me goose bumps easily on a big screen .   the message of the movie is very positive ,  and accordingly the movie is light and funny at times .  the music along the movie is usually pop ,  with a few instrumental pieces  ( i hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day ,  although i seriously doubt i will )  .   all together ,  i came out of this movie with a sensational feeling ,  and i'm not easily impressed  ( you'll have to take my word for it )  .  for this and more i give this movie a solid 8/10 . 
in life ,  we first organize stones  ( piedras in spanish )  such as a career ,  family ,  friendship ,  and love .  in this way ,  we shall find space between these to fit smaller stones ,  our small necessities .  if you act in an inverse way ,  you will not have enough room for larger stones .  the five protagonists in this film are women who have not been able to organize the large  " stones "  in their lives .  ramon salazar ,  a spanish motion picture director defines his first feature stones in this way .  the film tells the parallel ,  conflicting trajectory of five women :  anita  ( monica cervera ,  1975- )  ,  isabel  ( angela molina ,  1955- )  ,  adela  ( antonia san juan ,  1961- )  ,  leire  ( najwa nimri ,  1972- )  ,  and maricarmen  ( vicky pena ,  1954- )  . all are endeavoring to remove the stones that insistently appear in their path or ,  worst ,  that are in their shoes .  they are five cinderellas in search of prince charming and a new chance in life .  the best story of these five cinderellas is that of anita  ( monica cervera )  who also stars in  " 20 centimeters ,  "   " busco ,  "   " crimen ferpecto ,  "   " entre vivir y sonar ,  "   " hongos ,  "  and  " octavia .

well i do disagreed with the other comment posted .  piedras is much much better them magnolia or any of the other films that were mentioned .   specially about non real characters ,  i think that someone just wrote that only because he never lived in the spanish society like i did  ( and i'm not spanish )  ,  is a very real film with real characters ,  very well done by one of the best spanish actress antonia san juan .   about be a european film in contrast with an american film ,  well we different societies ,  personally i dislike american modern films a lot  ( i like the classics and some of the andy american films but they are very few )  .   is a film about the continuous constitution of a person ,  liked or not we all make mistakes but some can learn about the mistakes . 
women have never looked so attractive and pathetic as in salazar's film piedras .  although editor's cut here and there might help the film ,  it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense mark from pedro almodovar's latest films .  5 different women are coping with their male partners and families .  beginning with several different stories bound to meet as the plot goes on ,  salazar portraits his women characters in the same neurotic and border-line behaviour familiar to almodovar .  a kleptomaniac high society lady with a fattish to smaller shoes ,  a burlesque house madam taking care of her disabled daughter ,  a drug addict dancer obsessed with her former boyfriend and a taxi-driver taking care of her late husband's disturbed kids ,  all roaming the streets of madrid in well designed scenes .  using some of almodovar's familiar actresses ,  the director succeeds in it's first film to give depth to all the characters sharing the film ,  and to create genuine sympathy with each of them .  the women controls the plot line ,  and the men are bound to be left with each other ,  eventually .  .  .  surprisingly good for a first film ,  and worth the time in any standard .  it is noticeable that salazar hesitated in some needed guidelines to the actresses ,  but an impressible act is shown anyway on the screen ,  especially by monica cervera ,  which played in his former short film .   a must to all almodovar's fans ,  and enjoyable to all . 
since i watched it for the first time ,   " piedras "  is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures i actually could watch over and over again .  the great screenplay depicts the lives of a bunch of women  ( all of them somehow interconnected )  with deep understanding and sensibility .  ramón salazar achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut ,  and proves himself as an efficient actors' director .    not that all performances are excellent ,  though .  of all leading ladies ,  they range from average  ( najwa nimri )  to very good  ( vicky peña )  ,  but the standing ovation should be directed to newcomer mónica cervera ,  who convincingly plays antonia san juan's retarded daughter .  enrique alcides is irresistibly charming as the girl's male nurse ,  and there are nice small turns from andrés gertrúdix ,  geli albaladejo and the director himself ,  ramón salazar .    " piedras "  is beautifully written and filmed ,  when i watched it i got so moved that i couldn't stop thinking of it for days .  i highly recommend it . 
several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters .  the shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives .  all are transformed at the end of the movie .  adela  ( antonia san juan )  leads a brothel ;  her daughter anita  ( monica cervera )  is retarded and has a restricted life .  leire  ( najwa nimri )  is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend ;  maricarmen  ( vicky peña )  has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife .  isabel  ( ángela molina )  is a bored rich lady .   other characters are used to connect the five main women characters .  in storytelling not everything is given away in the beginning :  some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience .  the shoe-theme is driven to extremes :  for example when leire as a shoe-designer and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes faints ,  she breaks one of her heels .   in editing small connections are made between the scenes .  a telephone rings ,  a cigarette is lit ,  a song ,  etc .  are used to make the connection and fast cuts .  frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching tv-levels .  it is strongly music-driven to set tone and atmosphere .  the cities of madrid and lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories ,  and shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters .  one of the more moving shots is when anita ,  who makes the same walk every day ,  widens her walk and restricted life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road :  how the restriction of space is visually translated is well done .  as with most spanish movies a lot of storytelling is done visually ,  using the soap-like stories as the simple backdrop .  there is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental but is still beautiful .   as ramón salazar is too much in love with his own material it is overlong .  some scenes are kitsch and on the soap level ,  including the acting  ( adela's love life ,  isabel's doctor )  .  the shoe-theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor .   this is often compared to magnolia because the structure is the same .  but they are different .  magnolia is more technically competent ,  but somewhat mechanical .  this has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually .  after seeing this ,  you are inclined to immediately move to the new movie-city :  madrid . 
a true story about a true revolution ,  25 of april  ;  a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years ,  that was imposing a colonial war on it's military's ,  for maintaining an empire  ( angola ,  mozambique ,  guine-bissau ,  cabo verde ,  s .  tomé e principe ;  the first and the last of the great colonial empire's of europe )  of 600 years ,  since it's beginning in the conquest of ceuta in 1415 ;  a revolution by the army for the people ,  and for a democratic portugal ;  the most's surprising fact in this revolution is that it were no people killed in it  ( except those that died in the hand's of pide ,  the political police of the state ,  during a brutal gunfire against an unarmed crowd protesting in front of it's headquarters in the day of the revolution ,  in 25 of april 1974 ,  has it show's on the film )  . and has all revolutions it has it's heroes ,  one them of was captain salgueiro maia ,  a returned soldier from the war ,  whose convictions along with the rest of the army ,  was that they were fighting  ( since 1961 )  a hopeless war ,  and that sometimes a soldier has to disobey it's country . 
principally it is the story of two men who were part of the portuguese revolution .  it was easy to understand the contest ,  but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else ,  or they shows also the period before or after this fact ,  here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts .  it could also be seen as a kind of documentary .  the movie focalize to these two people ,  showing as normal they were ,  not like common heroes ,  because the revolution come from people .  although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just  " capitaes "  as the main characters .  nice colors and lights during the whole movie ,  excellent work for the director being her first movie ,  she doesn't fall to the banal way .  well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd .  the character of maia  ( main one ) is well-made and there is also a good interpretation for stefano accorsi ,  able to show maia's limits ,  this not-being an hero . 
you know ?  our spirit is based on that revolution ,  it's asleep .  .  .  i can explain ,  i think !  !  well .  .  .  until that happen on 25th april 1974 ,  our freedom was limited ,  we didn't had liberty of speech ,  but when we got it at the revolution ,  it seems that portuguese people lost his opinion ,  we don't use our liberty of speech !  that's all a consequence of the revolution !  i think that's clear !  .  .  .  about the movie .  .  .  i think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting ,  but by the way i use to watch on portuguese movies it's quite good !  !  i like it very much ! 
vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 ,  coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career .  i am not too keen in romantic movies these days ,  because i see them as  " old wine in a new bottle "  and so predictable .  however ,  i have watched this movie three times now .  .  . and believe me it's an awesome movie .   vivah goes back to the traditional route ,  displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage .  the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do  ( or would do )  when it comes to marriage .  in that sense sooraj r .  barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie .   several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately :    * when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride  ( amrita rao )  - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family .  the song 'do anjaane ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene .   * the first conversation between shahid and amrita ,  when he comes to see her - i . e .  a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation .  also amrita's naive nature ,  limited eye-contact ,  shy characteristics and answering softly to shahid's questions .   * the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle  ( alok nath )  when she feeds him at shahid's party in the form of another's daughter-in-law rather than her uncle's beloved niece .   clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way .  the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her .  she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie ,  and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly .   shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too .  he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r .  barjatya film .  in fact shahid and amrita make a cute on-screen couple ,  without a shadow of doubt .  other characters - alok nath  ( excellent )  ,  anupam kher  ( brilliant )  ,  mohan joshi  ( very good )  .   on the whole ,  vivah delivers what it promised ,  a well made and realistic story of two families .  the movie has top-notch performances ,  excellent story and great music to suit the film ,  as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r .  barjatya .  it's a must see ! 
 " capitães de abril "  is a very good .  the story isn't a documentary about the 1974 revolution in portugal .  but it gives us an idea of how it was like .  the fiction of the story isn't of great interest ,  but it doesn't spoil the movie .  the heroic actions of captain salgueiro maia aren't exaggerations and the film is also a tribute for his deeds .  captain salgueiro maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the 25th of april revolution .   all the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully .  lisbon looks beautiful as ever .  don't miss it !  i liked this film very much . 
being half-portuguese doesn't render me half-blind  ( nor half-prejudiced )  when discussing portuguese films .  not that i get to do that very often anyway .  but this film was such a rush of adrenaline !  yes ,  that's right - it was mostly accurate as far as history went/goes - but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguese-film territory :  things like using real locations in the middle of traffic-congested lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago .  and by god did they get it right !  ok ,  to sum it up :  very emotional if you've lived through it ,  but you'll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were .  if you're just watching it randomly ,  you're in for a good historical romp ,  only of the very recent history kind and a bit more thought-proving than usual .  even by european standards ,  yes . 
probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life ,  and i enjoyed it .  the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in portugal in 1974 ,  to finally defeat the fascist government of caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies ,  i . e .  mozambique ,  angola ,  and guinea  ( bissau ) - cape vert .  most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup ,  of the oppressed people ,  who were very happy with this new development and the liberty ,  the resistance of caetano's men ,  and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials ,  including spinola ,  who took over as the new president .  the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers ,  but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that portugal should develop itself democratically ,  and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution .  the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone ;  even the most serious enemies were respected at the end . 
considering the lack of art with in african cinema  ( or black american cinema )  .  the idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers .  but the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short .  but it is the unstated assertion of independence from these themes that is most sticking .  the genre is unique and not the typical expectation .  it is almost this departure which first catches the eye ,  so watching it twice is critical .  the film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self to the true art of cinema .   and it is this true art that with an african voice that is extremely rare .  the film doesn't copy to attain its message ,  it innovates and provokes by pulling at subtle stereotypes  ( not racial but character based stereotypes )  ,  from a writers perspective the film is brilliant .  it carries multiply messages which include a very rapid character development .  it must be remember this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish character very quickly .  the usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended .  but considering the director ,  owen alik shahadah's last venture 500 years later ,  music is to be expected .  but from a theme point-of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire eludes indirectly to a social problembrilliant stuff ! 
the idea ia a very short film with a lot of information .  interesting ,  entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more .  the producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that i have seen .  i have rated this film at the highest possible rating .  i also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment .  what comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to ,  their voice is never heard .  it is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward .  i hope that the produced will produce a second part to this 'idea' .  i look forward to viewing the sequence .  once again congrats to halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind . 
the idea is a very smart title the film has a serious tongue in cheek feel to it .  but it is so subtle you don't know how to read it !  are these guys doing a full blown comedy or is there something else going on .  the little dialogue the film has isn't very delicate and this adds to the power of the film .  if all the sound was switched off from the film it actually wouldn't take anything away from the film .  the physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it on its own carries the entirety of the story .   i is a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame .  i first say this film as part of a  " black "  film festival .  after watching the film i was so impressed by the work .  but then i asked myself what next ?  where can someone else see this work ?  the common association of art without purpose isn't to be found here .  you can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish .  the usage of african music the style the casting everything seems planned and for a reason .  the character development is amazing .  the casting i think is the strongest aspect of the film ;  the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of actual film .   we need to see more of these kinds of films ,  there really needs to be greater support for the development of short films across the board . 
this film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing .  we as a people of african descent owe it to ourselves to make a change to this cycle of  " all talk and no action "  and start to realise in order to make a change ,  there needs to be less talk and more action .  it is a powerful statement of the divisions of our people over small issues ,  and our failings to recognise the bigger picture and the need to unite in order to make a difference .  .  .  despite its reference to the black community ,  all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray . 
i saw this film with a special screening of the work of owen alik shahadah .  it is so interesting where did this guy come from .  now he is probably the key independent african filmmaker in the world .  and i am not talking about black filmmakers i am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture .  the idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of african themes ,  with his film 500 years later it is a african issue .  but the idea doesn't fit that mold .  showing the artistic diversity .  the film is an all african cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to .  i just love the mild comedy in it .  and the kora of tunde jegede is just amazing ,  it is really a art-house gem . 
interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve .  it also addresses the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as outspoken and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity .  the injection of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable experience .  . a must see for anyone who is interested in a reflective yet comical look at life .  i am eagerly looking forward to your next product . hope that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment .  excellent work  .  .  .  .  .  . joanne
this film speaks a universal language ;  one can relate it to the self ,  community ,  society or the wider world .  it has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of discovering and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self conviction / ownership .  the portrayal of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us which must be recognised as being the repeating cycle of destruction ,  the opposing force of innovation ,  creativity and growth .  the factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled .  the idea ,  is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it taps into one's internal voice / conscience through the looking ,  it makes one feel as opposed to just watch . 
spoilers contained in order to make a observation .   twenty years on from 1984 ,  this film speaks loads about prince's future in the music industry .   there is a scene that sums up prince's musical output of the last 10 years perfectly ,  which is if you took the best two songs off his last 10 albums you would have one fantastic album !   the scene plays like this .  prince runs off to his dressing room after playing one song and the owner of the club enters the dressing room to give prince an earful about his fall from grace during the 90's and putting out albums that only the most hardcore fans would be able to tolerate and support his artistry .   club owner-  " you're not packing them like you used to .  the only person that digs your music is yourself !  "   spooky huh !  how about the musical underscore which makes prince even more evil when he smacks apollonia to the ground in two separate scenes !  it gave me chills that that was not the only scene women where mistreated in this film .   i'm all for the comedy sparring's between morris day and jerome benton as these two stole every scene they were in .  but what was funny about throwing a woman into a trash can ?  that was plain nasty !  the other nasty bit was the chalk outline of prince's father on the floor thoughtfully provided by the minnieapolis police ,  which causes prince to go even more loony !  !  fantastic !  !   purple rain is an entertaining film overall ,  as it is the soundtrack of prince songs that boosts it's value by 110% .  but then again the film gives us another theory on prince and his music ,  as the film tells us that prince's biggest song of the film is written by wendy ,  lisa and princes wife beating musical father !   are prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his fathers music sheets of written songs ?  maybe that is why prince started to run out of steam during the 90's because he ran out of his fathers ideas ?  ?  ?  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . hmmmm .  .  .  .  . 
purple rain is a great film if you are a 40-something music lover who partied to prince music in the 1980s .  the story is a much-used formula :  rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional hurdles to find his audience and self-respect .  prince is a bad actor ,  but his performance ,  especially of purple rain/i would die 4 u make it worth sitting through the film .  he is himself and as a showman ,  as powerful on stage as mick jagger or michael jackson ,  circa thriller .  apollonia kotero ,  a former prince protégé ,  is beautiful and shows some acting talent and chemistry with prince ,  but her script doesn't let her far .  morris day and other supporting actors provide comedic elements . 
purple rain is so cool for the dad .  we are tracking 921 callers from minneapolis .  hudson horstachio prepares to ride a motorcycle  ,  take a ride with franklin fizzlybear in the caddy .  let's go back to 1984  ,  it was a movie released and prince tripped into stardom .  you would think hudson horstachio will be a superstar for his new movie in 20th century fox movie called  " vp  :  purple rain "   ,  starring hudson horstachio  ( voiced by dan green  ,  who played max's dad  ,  the pokemon gym leader )  .  9 tracks .  tina turner's private dancer and billy ocean's suddenly was headed for the album as prince held more concerts .  it is time we've pulled the plug on the 1984 movies .  our 20th century fox fans are not watching anymore .  the kid yells out  " look out for the deer !  "  is such a danger in mind  ,  ralph schuckett will be composing and conducting the new movie called  " vp  :  purple rain "  released on video .  tom cruise jumps into his motorcycle  ,  brad pitt jumps into his motorcycle and hudson horstachio jumps into his motorcycle .  thanks to bette midler from beaches and the keyboardists .  you are beholding the heroic horstachio  ,  hudson !  bart is writing  " i shall not watch purple rain "  on the chalkboard  ,  go on the bloomington ferry bridge and enjoy the kid's festivities .  hudson horstachio is watching you ! 
bar some of the questionable acting  ( there musicians at the end of the day )  ,  this in the words of quentin tarrinno is  " the best rock movie ever made .  .  . period "   think 8 mile ,  but without the rapping - a young musician ,  trying to prove himself to the local community ,  whilst struggling to cope with a broken home and a rival band .  throw in the sex interest and the truly exceptional performances ,  this is the real 8 mile .   prince provides a solid performance ,  as does morris day and jerome benton .  decent script ,  good direction ,  great plot ,  and spectacular performances .  not forgetting the some of the best rock/pop/funk music you will ever hear . 
and i really mean that .  i caught it last night on vh1 ,  and i was not expecting it to be so good .  this is now one of my favorites .  i must add that it has a killer soundtrack . 
this film is outstanding and wonderfully scored .  prince's oscar for music was richly deserved  ( many people don't know he won one )  .  i think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on dvd .  a great surprise :  prince does a fine job acting ,  and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera .  morris day ,  wendy ,  and lisa are good in their supporting roles .  very cool landmark film . 
our imp of the perverse did good his first time out ,  thats for sure .  the music is the best you may ever hear by any human ,  but you already know that ,  unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness .  a poor script that doesn't flesh out much of a story ,  but at least it has its moments .  the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it .  he deserved an oscar for this s**t ,  even though he was at times an ego driven twit ,  with his towering bodyguard chick huntsbery always in front .  a movie that made non-fans fans ,  take it or leave it .  prince does need to stay clear of acting in the future though .  he takes himself way to serious .  he is a genius musician ,  but pleaseee .  . just enjoy the ride ,  my purple maestro .  . peace . 
i have to admit that purple rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures .  purple rain not only broke boundaries ,  it set a decade ,  the costumes ,  the music ,  the behavior ,  and the dancing !  to this day ,  my friends and i still jam to the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be prince and the revolution .   now the movie itself ,  i just meant what i said in the title ,  because for the most part ,  this movie itself is made by the music .  the acting ?  please don't let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures ,  because i know that it was not oscar worthy by any means .  but i think the duo that took this movie was morris and jarome ,  their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious .  i just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because i felt that it was what made the movie .   prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music .  while the movie and acting is pretty bad ,  this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too .  this movie defined the 80's ,  so just have fun with it .  prince would want it that way ,  just to party on down !  oh ,  boy ,  that sounded lame .   9/10
this movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old ,  where actors didn't have to take their clothes off to make viewers watch their film .   firstly i think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between shahid and amrita ,  it is definitely the making of the film .   i have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy .  in response to this ,  i think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis ,  however considering this is a barjatya film i think that compared to mpk ,  hahk ,  hssh and mpkdh ,  it has been toned down significantly .  hssh was almost unbearable to watch in some places .   in this film however ,  when the sentimental moments come along ,  you find yourself smiling ,  wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to them .   another major plus point is the performances of shahid and amrita .  both have acted very well ,  especially shahid who looks great in the film .  amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star .   although i really enjoyed the film as a whole ,  i do feel that it was too long .  some of the middle could have been trimmed off and it would maybe made even more of an impact .  i also think the music ,  although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack had been available .  although the picturisation of the songs mujhe haq hain and hamari shaadi mein are wonderful .   all in all ,  i definitely recommend this film ,  its romantic ,  looks stunning and has a dramatic climax  ( i won't go into details ,  just in case you haven't seen it .   ps .  if you're prone to crying-take a tissue !   ( i needed several ) 
when this movie first came out back in 1984 ,  prince was one of the hottest acts around .  everyone wanted to see this movie ,  which was not much more than a extended music video .  the acting was pretty bad ,  but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time ?  despite that ,  it was still a very entertaining film !  morris day and jerome benton provide some all time classic comedy ,  especially their rendition of  " the password "  ,  which will make you think of abbott & costello doing their  " who's on first "  baseball routine .   appolina  ( who went by a single name then )  provided some beautiful breasts ,  so you had the brief nudity covered .  plus ,  she is very attractive .  and of course ,  the soundtrack of the album is one of the best prince ever recorded .  prince later on had a fallout with warner bros .  and changed his name ,  but at this particular time in his career ,  he was at the top of his game .   this movie doesn't rank in the all time great category ,  but it is pretty entertaining . 
i've recently went back and watched this movie again from not seeing it in years .  when i first seen the movie i was too young to understand what the movie was about .  now that i've seen it again i couldn't believe what i've missed all these years .  for me being able to see movies for what they are ,  i think that this movie was great .  most people feel as though the music are the best part ,  but i don't think that's true .  most people don't realize how good the story is because it's judge by the acting .  the truth of the matter is that no one in the movie were really trying to act rather they were just being themselves .  the entire main cast were just playing themselves .  they weren't trying to be anyone else ,  but themselves .   i've actually watched and analyzed the work and effort put into the movie .  now from my perspective ,  the situations shown in the movie are pretty much based on what actually went on musically in minneapolis at the time and it's most of the things that happen are actually true events that happened in prince's career and who can tell it better than him ?  the music that was coming from the city at the time was starting to be recognized and be revolutionary .  it was interesting to see how the music was very influential mainly at the club  " first avenue & 7th st entry "  where in fact prince ,  among other musicians ,  got their career started .  it's also a known fact that prince and morris day always had a competition with each other in real life ,  but it was a friendly competition .  they were always friends .  so the story basically plays off of that competition aspect of their rivalry rather than their friendship which shows the true competitive side of what occurred at club  " first avenue "  for it's time .   another reason why this movie is good is due to the fact that some of the situations that occur in the movie are actually based on events that prince has gone through in his life with the music aspect and the personal .  to me ,  this made the movie more realistic as far as the emotion because he's telling his trials and tribulations pre-superstardom .  plus ,  his dedication he puts into his performances is phenomenal .  prince made sure that every moment in the movie was done perfectly .  anytime you hear a song play in the movie it's in perfect sync with the situation at hand .   prince is in all a musical genius and he has proved it on many occasions .  this movie is what really put prince on the map officially and he hasn't slowed down since .  anyone who has watched this movie or still  ( unbelieveably )  hasn't watched it yet ,  when you sit down and view this film you have have to watch it with intellect or you will miss the whole aspect of the movie .  if you really love music this is definitely the movie to watch .  above what anyone else says i think it's a great movie to watch and own . 
this is one of the best movies to come from bollywood in years .  certainly the best this year until now .  indian to the core ,  the panoramic visuals ,  the heart-pleasing dialogs and the melodious and soft music make the movie an exceptional one .  the apt depiction of indianvalues and culture makes the viewer search for his/her roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on life .   this movie is for viewers who enjoy a call to their imagination and philosophical senses .  if you like watching movies to get all your nerves excited through on-screen action ,  sex or terror ,  then this movie is not for you ,  because you will find that the movie is not full of 90 degrees twists in it .  it is as simple a story for a movie as it can get .  but that's exactly where the art of the movie lies .  one gets a real life experience ,  and the best thing is ,  this experience is one full of values and hope .  it is about the positive side of life ,  about the sweet things that god has showered on humans ,  as against the regressive movies that insist on showing dons ,  terrorists and underworlds .  this is not about things and people that have gone bad .  it is about the goodness that still persists ,  and that keeps the world running .  of course ,  every genre of movies is respectable but it takes a lot of courage and talent to come up with a movie that swims against the current and tries to open the eyes of the public to the hidden realities and truths .    having said that ,  here's more .  .  .    the movie is the journey of a couple from their engagement to their arranged marriage - yes ,  that's right ,  it is an arranged marriage and the couple come to know each other only through their parents ,  and learn to love each other .  the 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time ,  not full of  " enticing "  happenings ,  but one that nurtures the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other .  they learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives ,  and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage .  but have these been strengthened enough ?  their relationship will face the test of not only time but also fortune .  will they pass this test ?  that is what  " vivah "  is about . 
'i only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain . ' this is an excell film .  it should have been re-rated to pg-13 .  but anyways ,  prince's first film and greatest .  the follow-up sucked .  but i haven't seen for years so here's what i can remember about it .  the kid  ( prince )  has to juggle with winning over the love of his life ,  apollonia  ( herself )  ,  keeping his band together  ( the revolution as themselves )  and the tension in his family .  but his rival band  ( the time as themselves )  is ruining his life .  like morris  ( himself )  is trying to steal apollonia from the kid .  just like saturday night fever ,  flashdance and 8 mile .  really good .  rent it ,  laugh and cry and if you luv it ,  buy it . 
i'll start by relating my first encounter with prince's music .  it was in a bar ,  on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing bare breasted to  " 1999 "  playing on the speakers .  i asked people ,  who is this singer ?  i was told it was prince .  it was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful ,  topless dancer .  later i started hearing other prince songs and really  " digging "  them .  when purple rain came out i still knew very little about this fellow minnesotan .  the movie blew me away .  i instantly became prince's no .  1 fan of the  " war baby "  generation .  later i found out one of my cousins was his secretary ,  and she got me ,  and my nephew into a v . i . p .  prince concert where we sat next to his mother .  .  . how cool is that !  getting back to the topic at hand ,  i agree with siskel & ebert who called purple rain an instant classic .  i have seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it .  i thought prince's acting was fine ,  apollonia struggled a bit ,  but all in all the acting was fine .  john gielgud was not available to play 'the kid' so prince took the role .  the film is visually stunning ,  brilliantly paced  ( it never gets slow )  ,  and terrifically directed .  i rank it among the best movie musicals of all time .  the last time i watched it was after about a 7 year gap and it still delivered .  i am so proud of fellow minnesotan prince rogers nelson and would love to tell him personally .  he walked right in front of me during the above mentioned concert and said ,   " hi "  ,  to my nephew but not me .  he was chatting with his mom .  i was a bit crushed but he's still no .  1 with me . 
i was to young to ever know much about prince but in the past few years i've seen a lot of purple rain novelty tee's and i thought they were cool but i didn't want to buy a shirt i knew nothing about .  so one saturday it came on fuse and i decided to watch it .  i didn't know what the movie was going to be about before i watched it but it was great once i found out .  in the movie prince wasn't known as prince but as  " the kid "  .  all the performances where great to me but my favorite were purple rain ,  darling nicki ,  and i would die for you .  all the songs tied into what was going on through out the movie when his mother and father were always fighting the song when doves cried described what he was feeling .  i also like how clever prince was with the way he flirted with apallonia .  i liked when prince and appallonia first met in the club and he stood behind her standing and then once she turned around he disappeared !  great movie and now i cant even find one of those tee shirts  :  ( 
 " purple rain "  has never been a critic's darling but it is a cult classic - and deserves to be .  if you are a prince fan this is for you .   the main plot is prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl .  believe it or not this movie isn't just singing and dancing .  there are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming .  sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works .  very hit and miss .   no one can really act in the film .  everyone is from one of prince's side acts like  " the time "  and  " vanity 6 "  .  still ,  it adds charm to the movie .  when ever prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak .    in conclusion ,  go and see this if you love prince like me .  if you aren't a fan it'll make you one . 
i don't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets ,  this movie rocks !  excellent movie ,  has it all ,  great music ( prince of coarse !  )  ,  romance ,  and drama .   this is really a very sad movie ,  very moving .  i don't want to say to much more ,  i ; m not into giving away the plot ,  but i will say this-the film is very realistic ,  there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems ,  so many familys similiar to the one depicted in the film .  i see this as being very realistic and being so real ,  makes the movie that much more moving .  my generation loved this movie growing up ,  so many of us loved prince and there is alot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through similiar problems .   that said ,  it's definetly not just a movie for teens ,  id recomend it to all age groups .  and it's not all so dark ,  the movie has some great music ,  band performance scenes ,  and sexy fun scenes between prince and appelonia . 
this is not as bad a movie as some reviewers ,  and as the summary at the imdb page for this movie ,  say it is .  why ?  first is the fact that in 1984 the movie makers were daring enough to confront ,  as one of the plot elements ,  the issue of domestic violence -- so reviewers who complain about the plot are sadly missing one of the main points !  second ,  without the plot element of prince's movie relationship with his abusive father ,  the musical climax wouldn't work as well as it does -- so those reviewers who say that only the music is good have ,  once again ,  missed one of the points -- specifically ,  why it is so good .  .  . because all of the music in this film has a plot element backdrop that makes the music more effective .  third ,  give this movie a break !  for first-time movie producers and director ,  this is just not that bad !  there are far worse movies out there by accomplished movie people !  !  and last ,  the reviewers who say that the music is  " good "  have also missed the point -- check out the range of stylistic musical treatments ,  the variety ,  the musicianship ,  and the stage performance of prince -- truly one of a kind ,  going musically where no one else was going during the 1980's ,  and with a style seen in the work of other artists  ( clothes and movement :  which costuming elements came first ,  michael jackson's or prince's ?  also ,  see if you can spot the splayed fingers sweeping in front of the eyes that prince does in this movie ,  long before quentin tarentino's  " pulp fiction "  )  .  as the sum of its parts ,  not a bad movie at all . 
this is the only movie i've seen prince in but it don't matter .  and i thought he was only great at singing boy was i wrong .  this is probably his best performance .  the music is great .  thats why it won the oscar in 1984 for best music to a movie  ( or something like that )  .  now he has an oscar and grammies under his belt .  although the cursing gets in the way with the film  ( just make sure no little kids or in the room )  .  there isn't to much to say without revealing the plot .  you should really go out and get this movie your collection isn't complete unless you got this movie in it .  what else could i possibly say except for go and get this movie now ! 
i own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released .  prince doesn't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything ,  he's a musician and i feel like that is what he displayed here ,  he's just the best one to tell this story through influence .  most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault ,  still it is a great movie with even better music .  the principals and moral convictions in purple rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art . 
the movie is okay ,  it has it's moments ,  the music scenes are the best of all !  the soundtrack is a true classic .  it's a perfect album ,  it starts out with let's go crazy ( appropriate for the beginning as it's a great party song and very up-tempo )  ,  take me with u ( a fun pop song .  .  .  )  ,  the beautiful ones ( a cheerful ballad ,  probably the closest thing to r&b on this whole album )  ,  computer blue ( a somewhat angry anthem towards appolonia )  ,  darling nikki ( one of the funniest songs ever ,  it very vaguely makes fun of appolonia )  ,  when doves cry ( the climax to this masterpiece )  ,  i would die 4 u ,  baby i'm a star ,  and ,  of course ,  purple rain ( a true classic ,  a very appropriate ending for this classic album )  the movie and the album are both very good .  i highly recommend them ! 
i love this movie !  !  !  purple rain came out the year i was born and it has had my heart since i can remember .  prince is so tight in this movie .  i went to a special showing of purple rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued ,  it is really one of the greatest movies of all time .  the music is untouchable .  the movie is about  " the kid "  ,  played by prince ,  his family is dysfunctional ,  his band is the hottest act in town ,  and he has his eyes on the apollonia ,  an aspiring singer .  there is no question why purple is my favorite color i can thank  " the kid "  for that .  so if you have not seen this then you are need to asap .  this is a classic - 4ever ! 
you can debate prince's acting talent ,  or even his choice to parody his own life in this film .  there is no debate about his musical talent either then or now .  he seems like a shadowy has-been twenty years later ,  but the music remains relevant and fantastic .    having lived through the hype of this movie  ( graduated high school in'85 )  i can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time .  from tipper gore  ( al's wife )  trying to censor  " little nikki "  and every thing else under the sun via the pmrc  ( parents music resource center )  to every  " air band "  at the time impersonating prince ,  it was the absolute hottest thing out .  for a few weeks at least ,  prince was bigger than madonna and michael jackson .    we all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered .  it didn't disappoint .  everyone was caught up .  i was an mtv junkie at the time ( they actually played music then .  .  .  . all the time ) prince played at least once or twice an hour .  i must qualify this commentary by saying that ,  at that time ,  my favorites were billy idol ,  oingo boingo ,  the fixx ,  flock of seagulls and others in the punk/ new wave genre' the music of prince at the time transcended all types and styles .  one of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was soooooooo big then .  all the things that remind you of the 80's were iconic then .  it was mainstream and it seems like a cliché' now .  it got so popular that it became ridiculous .  it's like the rappin' granny commercial for wendy's hamburgers .    it looks stupid now because everyone was caught up in it  ( sadly ,  kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something .  anyway ,  i hope this gave you all a little insight . 
purple rain .  .  .  what else can i say ,  the title speaks for itself .  but i think all the actors were well picked .  the movie had a great story .  i loved it !  ever since i watched that movie ,  i've been stuck in the eighties ,  and i'm only 13 !  my favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all of his music compositions ,  and the apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his earing in her hand .  critics say that its a drama but i think its more of a romance .  murphy brown also did a great job in the movie ,  he actually acted like himself .  i'm so glad i've seen this movie .  the song purple rain ,  beautifully sung ,  was so heartfelt .  i cried more than once . 
it seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with george orwell's science fiction novel !  !  1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in american history !  !  the upsurge in the economy ,  and a reemergence in basic american values ,  cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence which was viewed by the american people with a very auspicious disposition !  !  there have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past ,  but ,  the originals are almost always considered superior !  !   " purple rain "  is such a movie in this category !  !  made in 1984 ,   " purple rain "  provided a doggerel of eighties ,  happy-go-lucky quality music ,  which they incorporated into the making of this excellent film !  !  certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics !  !  screwball comedies ,  neon accented clothing ,  and of course ,  the music !  !  eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in american history !  !  set in minneapolis ,   " purple rain "  accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city .  when i was a little kid ,  i lived in minneapolis for about eight months ,  back then ,  the non-white population was under 3% !  !  by 1984 ,  african americans had made some in roads into minneapolis ,  and ,  thus ,  they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well !  !  the movie  " purple rain "  evokes an eighties style clothing ,  and music ensemble ,  which effortlessly captivated the movie audience !  !  i loved the music to  " purple rain "  ,  and ,  the innovative approach this film takes to confrontational success ,  is indeed ,  brilliant !  !  see this movie if you have not seen it already !  !  prince became an eighties icon with this masterpiece !  !  for a short time ,  he dated kim bassinger ,  he must be doing something right !  !   " purple rain "  put prince on the map !  !  this film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of thumbs up !  !  !  ! 
ok ,  so it may not be the award-winning  " movie of the year "  type-film  ( apart from the brilliant soundtrack that i think won a few awards )  ,  but it is a really great film about 'the kid'  ( prince / o (  take your pick )  and the happenings around him living in minneapolis ,  playing his music .  the music is absolutely superb ,  in my opinion you have to own this soundtrack ,  it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion .  and the movie itself plays out a nice plot ,  it's worth seeing over and over again ,  espeically if you like prince / o  ( which i do )  of course . 
prince stars as 'the kid' in this semi-autobiographical film of a talented ,  but narcissistic young musician who has a less then stellar home life .  true the acting leaves a tad to be desired  ( barring morris day and especially clarence williams who are both pitch perfect )  ,  but the movie is still great and among the best to come out of the 1980s .  it has the best soundtrack of any movie of the last 50 years at least ,  highly quotable lines ,  and the dumpster scene is hilarious !  !  plus apollonia is just simply stunning .  on an unrelated not ,  when i saw prince in concert in 2004 he blew down the stadium .  he is an expert showman and it was one of the best concerts that i've experienced .   my grade :  a   dvd extras :  disc 1 )  commentary with director albert magnoli ,  producer robert cavallo ,  & director of photography donald thorin ;  theatrical trailer ;  trailers for  " under the cherry moon "  and  " grafitti bridge "  disc 2 )  a 12 minute featurette on the first avenue club ;   " purple rain :  bachstage pass  ( a half hour featurette on the movie which i'll review later on it's page )  ;   " riffs ,  raffs ,  and revolution :  the impact and influence of purple rain "  10 minute featurette ;  30 minutes of mtv's premiere footage  ( when mtv didn't suck donkey balls )  ;  5 prince music videos  ( let's go crazy ,  take me with you ,  when doves cry ,  i would die 4 u/ baby i'm a star ,  and purple rain )  ;  2 videos by the time  ( jungle love and the bird )  ;  and a music video for  " sex shooter "  by apollonia 6  eye candy :  apollonia shows her fine ass titties
this electrifying musical has more than a whiff of egotism from it's star ,  the musical genius that is prince .  the film is 90 or so minutes of posing but in truth it is easy to see why it is such a cult classic .   much like other films that centre around the struggling young musician trying to be big ,  this has a hint of drama in it to add a dimension to the musical numbers .  while this film isn't as good as 8 mile as a recent example ,  this is entertaining none the less and the soundtrack is much better .  on the dramatic side of things the story centres around the kid  ( prince )  a young artist and regular spot at a club .  the owner of the club is frustrated with the kid's arrogance and little does the kid know that he could soon be fired and replaced by a rival .  one the side the kid's parents are having trouble ,  with his dad abusing her violently .  during the course of the film the kid learns a few lessons in life ,  and learns to appreciate his friends more .  it's all stuff we have seen in coming of age dramas of course ,  but this is combined as a musical ,  a very stylised musical .   the cast are good .  prince is actually quite good on the drama side ,  when he's not striking a pose .  he seems human and relatable .  clarence williams is very good as the abusive father as well .  appollonia kotero makes a good debut as princes sexy love interest .   the main strength of the movie however is the superb soundtrack .  the musical numbers are well staged and electrifying .  prince is no doubt a musical maestro ,  albeit very eccentric .  when he is inspired he is great but on the flip side he will often do songs that are solely for his own taste ,  and occasionally his experimentation can miss-fire ,  but that is the same for many musical geniuses .  the soundtrack for this film is excellent though ,  with only sexshooter being a weak point .  the show-stopping performance of purple rain is the standout though .  it is one of my all time favourite songs .  ***  
as a big-time prince fan of the last three to four years ,  i really can't believe i've only just got round to watching  " purple rain "  .  the brand new 2-disc anniversary special edition led me to buy it .  wow ,  i was really looking forward to watching it ,  but i wasn't prepared for just how electric it actually is .  prince's musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding - he really has the moves in this one .  i am very familiar  ( from repeated listens )  with the classic  " purple rain "  album and all its songs ,  but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics - like computer blue ,  the beautiful ones ,  when doves cry and purple rain itself .  there is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where prince and the revolution perform .  the closing songs baby i'm a star and i would die for u show how much energy and sheer talent prince was brimming with in his mid-20s  ( he's overflowing !  )  ,  it blew me away .  it even makes michael jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years .   prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams - drive her to a lake ,  make her jump in ,  then drive off - absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight .   some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film's overall charm .  morris day is the coolest cat on the block  ( and hilarious )  ,  and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and jerome benton light up the stage minneapolis funk style - i love their dancing in this bit ,  and how benton provides morris with a mirror mid-performance .   i already can't wait to watch it again ,  i really can't !  extras are terrific - particularly seeing a young eddie murphy pre-beverly hills cop admit he is a  " prince groupie "  . 
a much undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught in an ever-declining spiral of domestic violence .   at times difficult to watch ,  while morris day is portrayed as the misogynist ,  prince as the knight on  ( motorcycle )  steed ,  he is still called upon to twice beat a woman as part of the screenplay .  that he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit to the writing .  prince is so free of ego in this film that not only does he portray himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women ,  but his most famous song is fictionalised as being written by his father and wendy & lisa .  even further ,  two of his compositions - computer blue  ( admittedly the album's weakest track )  and darling nikki - are shown as being songs that kill off an audience .  perhaps the only concession to the princely ego is a card that lists the  ( slightly shorter than prince )  apollonia as 5'6 .   the nearly complete-amateur cast are mainly band members playing themselves  ( and reviewers who slate the actors on the terms that they've never appeared in other movies are completely missing the point )  ,  and do perfectly well under the direction .  morris day gets most of the plaudits for his likable ham ,  though jerome benton must also get credit for bouncing off him well ,  particularly their stage act ,  which is hilarious .  day and benton even go so far as to make an abbott and costello routine funny ,  which takes some doing .   lastly ,  there's prince .  while i admit to bias ,  i do actually think he's a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a low-key version of himself .  acting isn't his profession ,  this was a film made for entertainment ,  so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role isn't robert deniro and thinking they're making a point is sadly deluded .  i don't want this review to be a derisory attack of other people's comments ,  but i've even this film slated as having a low budget and being darkly lit .  how would a film about domestic violence be shot ,  then ?  with full overhead spotlights and a cgi dinosaur walking into frame ?    the film acts almost as a perfect snapshot of the neon light and skinny tie era until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly perms and tinny synths ,  and this isn't some retro-recreation .  prince's best film with oscar-winning music ,  it sees him at his zenith ,  and it's saddening to realise that ,  even though he would make some fine albums ,  he would never again capture this high . 
vivah is by no means a classic .  however in the days of hardcore action ,  path-breaking special effects & complex plots  ( none of which bollywood has mastered yet )  ,  its quite refreshing to see a simple film like vivah .  the story as we all know is a journey from a couple's first meeting to their eventual wedding after some coy moments and testing times .  nothing more ,  nothing less .  the music isn't quite in the same league as mpk or hahk but doesn't jar your senses either .  two songs stood out for me - mujhe haq hai & do anjaane .  while milan abhi aadha & hamaari shaadi were hummable .  shahid performs sincerely & shows a lot of potential .  its good to see him play something else but the  " cool dude "  he normally does .  amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile small-town girl to perfection .  alok nath ,  anupam kher & seema biswas are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job .  suraj's direction is simple but effective .  the movie's prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers .  but all in all a good ,  clean ,  decent family movie . 
i had never seen richard thomas play a bad guy .  i wasn't sure i would like him this way .  and i wasn't sure he could pull it off .  but this astounded me .  he sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people .  the movie is engrossing and fast paced .  bruce davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy .  the real talent here is thomas .  the ending was a little clumsy but perhaps that's the way real people would fight .  .  .  if you are a thomas fan you must see him here at his best being bad ! 
what great locations .  a visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens . this little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 days .  good going folks !  .  i can not wait to see what your next feature will be .  i'll be with you all the way . 
all the talent mr .  sooraj barjatya showed in his first 3 movies ,  i thought were all an accident because his 4th one main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad .  but i have to say it wasn't an accident .  this guy is talented and the way he has done vivah is just brilliant .  right from the first scene it affects you .  the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome .  the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol .  as usual alok nath as the good and loving father is fantastic ,  so is anupam kher .  but its a shahid-amrita film . amrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom .  this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life .  all in all a brilliant film .  hats off to mr .  sooraj barjatya .  .  . 
savage island's raw savagery will scare the hell out of you !  trust me .   when the boy of the estranged savage family is run over by some city slicker tourists ,  pa savage wants revenge ,  and he'll stop at nothing until he gets it .   this is a real horror film with some truly wonderful horror moments .   also ,  the negative review clearly comes from someone who lacks proper knowledge of film .  the filmmakers chose the lighting and camera-work in order to reflect the dark ,  murky ,  and egdy mood of the story ;  in other words ,  to obtain a certain aesthetic .    in fact ,  the film has won several horror film festival awards . 
this is a good film for 99% of the duration .  i feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim .   it is shot in a rather naive fashion .  this is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique .   the gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the 'nutcase' called joe .  however ,  the wholesome  ( normal )  characters are a little too pathetic for my liking - granted ,  they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little ott .   the film starts slowly  ( and the naive camera work smacks of 'b' movie to start with )  and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur .  this is one of the most 'twisted' movies with respect to cold-hearted violence .   after the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending i was left feeling disappointed .  i would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the 'eeriness' and nail-biting scenes earlier on in the film .   give it a watch and excuse the ending ! 
i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it .  it actually exceeded my expectations .  considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well-made film .  the lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways ,  especially given the plot .  just like the blair witch project ,  this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film .  another bonus :  whereas most low-budget horror films  ( even the best of the best )  suffer from mediocre-to-unintentionally hysterical acting ,  this film actually had a talented cast  ( save one or two characters )  ,  particularly the two leads .  the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline .  it borrows heavily from better-known films like  " deliverance "  and  " wrong turn "  but if you're like me ,  films of this nature never cease to be terrifying .  plus ,  the director keeps things interesting throughout .  i'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out .  .  . 
very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment .   the script was very good as was the acting .  the visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film .  this affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending .    i was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever .    this movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment .  not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good . 
who ever came up with story is one sick person .  i rented it for our slumber party sleepover and all six of us got freaked out cause we're all in an acting class together ,  and we know a couple of the actors from class .  besides everybody screaming the whole freaky night ,  i had freaky nightmares .  i kept thinking oh my god ,  if i get up to go to the bathroom to pee i'm going to be stabbed in the middle of wiping or something .  i couldn't even go to the bathroom because we watched this gruesome horror movie .  i also thought why are all the girls topless in this movie but we don't any of the boys units ?  you should make a horror film where the killer is a girl and chopping off units .  i would watch that over and over .  call it hard or soft or something stupid like that .  i'm only giving this movie a 9 because you freaked me out freaks . 
i think this movie had to be fun to make it ,  for us it was fun to watch it .  the actors look like they have a fun time .  my girlfriends like the boy actors and my boyfriends like the girl actors .  not very much do we get to have crazy fun with a movie that is horror make .  i see a lot of scary movies and i would watch this one all together once more ,  or more because we laugh together .  if this actors make other scary movies i will watch them .  the grander mad man thats chase to kill the actors is very much a good bad man .  he make us laugh together the most .  i would give this movie a high score if you ask me .   i don't know if the market has any more of the movies with the actors ,  but the main boy is cute .  the actor with the grand chest has to be not real .  they doesn't look to real . 
jane eyre has always been my favorite novel !  when i stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90's i was ecstatic !  this is the best and most complete version of the book on film !  this version is a little long to sit through in one sitting but well worth it .  timothy dalton is amazing as rochester .  i was glad that they cast a normal looking actress  ( zelah clark )  as jane and not a glamorous person .  i love the sets and the location .  for anyone who is a true jane eyre fan ,  this is the version to watch !  !  !  for those of you who are interested ,  i just found this version on dvd .  i have watched my vhs copy almost to breaking so i was thrilled to find it on dvd . 
last night i finished re-watching  " jane eyre "   ( 1983 )  ,  the bbc mini-series adapted from charlotte bronte's gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of english literature with timothy dalton  ( my favorite james bond )  as mr .  edward rochester and zelah clarke ,  as jane eyre ,  a poor orphaned 18-year-old girl ,  a governess at mr .  rochester's estate ,  thornfield .   " jane eyre "  has been one of my most beloved books since i was an 11-years-old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words ,   " this book is amazing "  and so it was and i have read it dozens of times and i am still not tired of it .  its beautiful language ,  refined ,  fragrant ,  and surprisingly fresh ,  the dialogs ,  and above all ,  two main characters ,  and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers .   " jane eyre "  has been adapted to tv and big screen many times ,  18 according to imdb .  the actors as famous and marvelous as joan fontaine and orson welles ,  william hurt and charlotte gainsbourg ,  george c .  scott and susannah york ,  ciarán hinds and samantha morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society ,  laws ,  religion ,  by the differences in age ,  backgrounds ,  experiences ,  and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years .  of all these films i've only seen one ,  300 minutes long bbc version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where timothy dalton who frequently plays dark ,  brooding characters did not just play edward rochester brilliantly and with class ,  he was mr .  rochester - sardonic ,  vibrant ,  the force of nature ,  powerful ,  passionate ,  sexy ,  and tormented master of thornfield .  zelah clarke was also convincing as sweet ,  gentle ,  intelligent and strong jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning ,  and quiet but firm willpower .   added on september 17 ,  2007 :  during the last two weeks ,  i've seen five  " jane eyre "  movies and it was a wonderful experience .  there is something to admire in every adaptation of  " jane eyre "  even if not all of them are completely successful .  this version is still my favorite  " jane eyre "  film . 
playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a poisoned chalice for an actor ,  paying for the pleasure of a meaty character by competing with the fantasies of generations of readers  not to mention the numerous other actors who've besieged the castle before .  fortunately for the fantasists ,  this version  with the nicely cast zelah clarke and timothy dalton  stands head and shoulders above versions that have come after it .  it's the right length to do the story full justice ,  and makes considerable use of bronte's cracking dialogue ;  none of that modern meddling away ,  cutting text and adding new and inferior scenes .   the magic of the original story lies in the tensions created between the central characters ,  and the lives circumstances create for them to lead .  jane   " poor ,  plain and little "   grows up on the stinting charity of a cold aunt ,  her nature and independence shaped by a long spell in a very harsh school .  she arrives as a governess in the household of mr rochester ,  utterly friendless and alone .  she represses herself habitually out of duty and hard experience ,  but her passionate nature soon finds its touch-paper in her stern ,  keenly intelligent ,  enigmatic master ,  to whom she is drawn ,  as he is to her ,  by forces beyond their control .  rochester is the caged tiger ,  busy  " paving hell with energy "  ;  potentially dangerous to all who come into contact with him  but  " pervious ,  through a chink or two "  .  his character is extraordinary :  he takes extraordinary liberties with a paid subordinate ;  but then jane is no ordinary employee ,  as he sees .  but a dark secret ,  and severe trials ,  lie before them both .   it's a pleasure to hear bronte's remarkable dialogue spoken by such accomplished actors  dalton in particular seems formed for passion on a brontean scale .  if you've only ever seen him as a not-so-memorable bond ,  you've missed the thing he's best at .  those who've commented that his rochester is too handsome ,  miss the point of these dramatisations :  his character has simply too much screen time for a really ugly man to retain the viewer's attention .  timothy dalton is just right ,  not always or consistently handsome ,  but often glancingly ,  strikingly so ,  just as it should be .  and zelah clarke's jane is no wallflower ;  she conveys the emotions of a woman who habitually represses her sense of humour and her passionate nature very successfully ,  allowing her rare outbursts to show to more dramatic effect .   not so long ago the bbc aired an excellent dramatisation of jean rhys' enlightened and most unsettling riposte to bronte ,   " wide sargasso sea "  ,  imagining the back-story of the first mrs rochester .  do check it out  you'll never see the 'hero' of  " jane eyre "  in quite the same way again . 
in all the comments praising or damning dalton's performance ,  i thought he was excellent .  he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy ,  but as a roguish ,  powerful man .  i liked this version ,  although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting ,  and the scenes with jane and st .  john never quite gelled .  i give this an 8 . 
my comments for vivah  : - its a charming ,  idealistic love story starring shahid kapoor and amrita rao .  the film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom's families sleeping on the floor ,  playing games together ,  their friendly banter and mutual respect .  vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals .  yes ,  the central romance is naively visualized .  but the sneaked-in romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism .  the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom ,  on the wedding night ,  tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries :   " come let me do your dressing "   v i v a h - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage ,  beauty of indian culture ,  beauty of indian woman ,  last but not least a nice idealism of the about-to-be-couple waiting to get married  .  .  .  .  playing by the rules  !  simple yet beautiful ;  such a simple story  .  .  .  .  no plot  .  .  .  no villain - as is the case with most of sooraj barjatya films .  sooraj sir is back to what he does best .  he has made the movie with full conviction .  its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage & the union of 2 families .  i think amrita rao - looks very good & she has acted very well .  she has most of the good scenes - although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance .  i also liked the acting of all others for ex .  the choti i . e .  amrita prakash ,  alok nath ,  anupam kher ,  shahid's bro & sis-in-law .  it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could .  sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after maine pyar kiya ,  hahk & hum saath saath hain .  the chemistry between shahid & amrita is awesome .   stuff like sanctity in a marriage/relationship ,  avoiding courtship ,  mutual respect ,  care & space ,  waiting for getting married  " officially "  ,  praying/sacrficing for ur beloved - all these and more get showcased in vivah .  there's still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film .  some of the folks/audience are already excited after seeing ,  that they r thinking bout arranged-marriage  :  )  thats success if you ask me .  it seems amrita rao - our actress-from-vivah {result for a nice performance} has been bestowed the prestigious dadsaheb phalke award for 2006  !  !  hats off to her for this achievement chalo ,  even though vivah  ,  shahid or amrita didn't get any of the film-fare & other awards ;  @ least this is news to cheer about  !  !  congrats to amrita rao- for showing us a visual of indian bride-to-be in the purest form and of course to sooraj barjatya for portraying her the best way  :  )  shudn't forget shahid kapur and all others who make vivah as sweet and legendary as it is today  !  !  imagine ,  to share the same pedestal as the legendary dilip kumar  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  its no mean achievement  !  !  congrats to amrita rao - for taking her career to another level with this award  .  .  .  .  i personally feel - she should keep doing movies only with shahid kapur  !  !  they make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of {srk-kajol} or {aamir khan & juhi chawla}  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    some points that i observed , few of the elements  : - #1 if u notice carefully ,  amrita rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses .  she gives every bit of the indian woman essence - in this film  !  !  perfect fit #2 shahid kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early-marriage  .  .  .  .  but prem listens carefully to the step-wise talk given by his dad - having full faith in anupam kher .  eventually  " honesty "  &  " trust "  are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita .  most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person .  but according to what i saw in this film ,  i have a feeling - that two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also ,  its possible  !  !  !  #3 in the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where shahid & amrita are together - or shown to be together .  its unlike most other romantic/wedding-based movies where hero & heroine are always singing/dancing or nowadays - doing cheap stuff .  but the beauty of each of these 5 sequences  : - characterized by restraint ,  innocence & respect for the other  !  #4 i really liked the relationship shown between chacha alok nath & amrita rao .  these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters/girl-kids in some parts of india .  #5 romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely - no cheap scenes , songs are beautifully pictured  !  !  words like  " jal "  ,  " praarthana "  e . t . c .  are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film  :  )  personally ,  i really am fond of many dialogs in this film .  #6 last but not the least - the entire hospital scene where shahid puts  " sindhoor "  to amrita when shes struggling for life - is terrific .  those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the love/i-cant-do-without-u  ;  its a hats-off feeling  !  !  !    *** in many ways ,  vivah reminded me of maine pyar kiya ,  ddlj ,  qayamat se qayamat tak ,  hum dil de chuke sanam - for the freshness/on-screen-chemistry of the lead pair  :  )   :  )  *** if u ask me  : - along with films like rang de basanti ,  lage raho munnabhai ,  dor ,  corporate and kabul express ,  v i v a h ranks among the best films made in 2006 .  in fact - i think vivah does deserve better viewing/business than dhoom2 or fanaa or golmaal or all those time-pass/fuzzy/style/crap movies  !

the 1983 bbc production of  " jane eyre "  starring zelah clarke and timothy dalton  ( love him )  has always been and will always be my favorite jane eyre .  if you watch any other version of jane eyre without reading the book ,  it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day .  but watching this one almost equals to reading the book .  i used to watch these miniseries a lot when i was little ,  and they inspired me to read the book .  at the time i didn't pay attention to how close this television production was to the book .  recently ,  i watched the 1996 version of jane eyre and was very disappointed .  it was only 2 hours long and didn't have many important scenes from the book  ( such as my favorite gypsy scene )  .  after that i fell in love with this  " jane eyre "  even more because it includes all the important scenes of the book and it just tells the whole story (  the other versions don't ,  if you haven't read the book )  .    the cast of 1983 jane eyre is excellent .  it's true that timothy dalton is a very handsome actor  ( handsome enough to play butler in  " scarlet "  ,  and julius caesar )  ,  but he is so great as rochester that i can't imagine anybody else playing this role .  and zelah clarke is ,  without a doubt ,  the only jane that follows the description of the book .  the other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors .  jane looks so modest and naive ,  just as bronte describes her  ( although she doesn't look 18 ,  but do you actually pay attention to that ?  .  .  .  )    some people say that this  " jane eyre "  is too long ,  but i would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend 2 hours watching some other version .  some say the movie is dull and boring because jane is not passionate enough ,  or because there are not enough  " kissing scenes "  .  i hate when they make jane eyre some  " hollywood movie "  with inappropriate kissing scenes .  you don't have to include  " crazy ,  madly in love "  scenes to show the love between jane and rochester .  and both zelah and timothy express this love so perfectly that there are no other scenes needed !  !  i am 19 years old ,  and many girls of my age refer to this film as  " boring and old-fashioned "  .  but i can only feel sorry for them because they don't appreciate the purity and beauty of it .  after all ,  the novel is set in 19th century ,  and that old-fashioned look makes it more attractive and more like the book .    i don't think there will ever be any other version of jane ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one .  no matter who plays jane and rochester in other movies ,  the real jane and rochester  ( for me at least )  will always be zelah clarke and timothy dalton ! 
though i did not begin to read the  " classics "  in literature until i was 47 ,  it's never too late .  jane eyre is a favorite for many reasons ,  mainly because there isn't a part of the book i liked less ,  only parts i enjoyed more .  the 1983 tv mini-series with zelah clarke and timothy dalton was everything i hoped it would be .  i saw it as a full length movie in 2006 .  dalton's 'mr .  rochester' was very good but i absolutely loved zelah's 'jane eyre' .  relecting on another 'classics' movie i saw recently ,  i was disappointed in the production ,  direction and dialogue .  it was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of hollywood .  artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism .  using the title after such license is fraud .  leave it to the brits to get this one right  ( among others )  .  you won't be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with it's proper context and spirit .  well done bbc . 
when my now college age daughter was in preschool ,  this miniseries appeared on a&e from 8-9 each morning .  my neighbor and i made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of jane eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week .  good choice .   i'd forgotten how much i loved this movie until i got out my old vhs copy recently .  timothy dalton is very handsome ,  but still perfect as rochester .  the dark ,  craggy face ,  the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book .  although dalton eats a little scenery ,  i couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy william hurt or grumpy ciaran hinds .  the magic here is that women love dalton and get caught up in the romance .   i would love to know what's become of zelah clarke .  she is dead on as jane ,  quiet ,  formal ,  saying volumes with but a look .  the sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth .  criticism of her performance as  " wooden "  is misplaced .  a servant in a proper english household would have maintained just such a demeanor ,  but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion .  unlike many other screen janes ,  she appears plain enough to be jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy rochester's attraction to her .   bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact .  dalton and clarke capture the interplay between jane and rochester with wit and quiet intensity .  although jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard ,  she refuses to be cowed by the dark ,  blustery rochester .  the two leads play off each other beautifully .    this is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever . 
i have recently seen this production on dvd .  it is the first time i have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as i remembered .  at first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and i suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the bbc serials were back then .   ( i miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on sunday afternoons back then )  but that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been .  i am a bit of a  " jane eyre "  purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one .  i have recently re-read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on .  reading the scene near the end where rochester questions jane about what st john was like i noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly .    all the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way ,  some even leave out the  " rivers "  family and their connection to jane altogether .  i also think this is the only production to include the  " gypsy "  scene done correctly .   the casting is perfect ,  zelah clarke is like jane is described in the book  " small plain and dark "  and i disagree that she looked too old .  timothy dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as rochester ,  portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off !  i agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time ,  like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted ,  his expression is fantastically frightening .  but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another .  a love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable .  oh to be loved by a man like that !  there were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however ,  like when jane climbs in to bed with the dying helen and also when rochester takes jane shopping for her wedding things  ( i thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks )  .   finally if you never see another production of jane eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection ! 
this has to be the best adaptation i have seen it's my favourite and i think it stays very close to the book . what really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead actors . the wonderful timothy dalton is the best rochester i have seen on screen brooding and tragic , while zelah clarke is the perfect combination of strength , courage , shyness and gentleness as jane .  the story ( as i'm sure most people know ) is this , the young and plain jane eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800's who advertises her services as a governess in the newspapers . she is offered the post of governess at the big mansion thornfield hall to tutor adele the young ward of the halls mysterious and respected owner mr rochester .  as the months go on he falls in love with jane and puts into effect a few situations to try and see if jane is as madly in love with him as he is with her . however there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at thornfield hall and when it is it's effects are devastating . this is a moving and well acted drama with nice locations and gorgeous costumes plus as i said earlier excellent acting especially from zelah and timothy . 
if a more masterful adaptation than this one even existed ,  you need not look for it ;  you will find all and more in this near-perfect presentation of charlotte brontë's masterpiece .   rarely have i seen a film that would urge me to read the novel on which it was based ,  but i admit to that here .  although i have not read jane eyre ,  i am convinced that i have missed very little in the way of dialogue and plot or of intensity and emotion .  i only wish to explore the novel due to the immense curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has stirred within me .   i need not divulge anything in the way of plot here .  let me just say this :  if you are perhaps unsure as to whether you should watch or read the beautiful story that is jane eyre ,  i implore you to doubt no more !  every atom of might and magic that has reared jane eyre as a popular classic of english literature has successfully been captured in this film .   what brontë did not bring herself ,  clarke and dalton managed to translate in the limelight with stupendous intensity .  the movie's success is ,  no doubt ,  due in no small part to their acting prowess .   love jane eyre or hate her ,  but appreciate the richness ,  the vitality ,  the truth of the story ;  love the characters ;  love the actors ;  all just as you would love what is great in cinema . 
this is ,  in my opinion ,  much better than either of the 2 1990's versions ,  but is still not all that good .  it feels dated ,  probably because it is ,  but it does stand up well compared to other bbc 1980's period pieces such as mansfield park and northanger abbey .   the length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90's versions ,  and st john rivers is at least covered ,  although not very well .  timothy dalton is very good as rochester ,  but the actress playing jane is much too old .  there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it . 
this was a fabulous adaptation of jane eyre .  the only problem i had with it was that i didn't like zelah clarke .  i thought she was too old and made jane seem much to timid .  in the book jane seemed like a much stronger character .  i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her .  the part where it's the morning after rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh .  i think they made a bad choice in casting her .  but dalton was absolutely wonderful as rochester .  he makes this version of jane eyre worth seeing .  another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of film .  i know it was made in the eighties for tv .  if it had been a feature film ,  and better quality ,  it would have been perfect .  my main complaint however ,  is that zelah clarke was definitely too old . 
i liked timothy dalton very much even though he was a bit young and too handsome for mr r .  but i thought zelah clarke too plump and short .  this version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed .  i have seen 4 versions ,  orson welles is still my favorite mr r  ,  though george c scott did very well and it's a toss up between joan fontaine and sussanah york ,  although they were both a bit too old for the role .  i recently saw a brilliant tv version of rebecca with charles dance and emilia fox .  i would love to see those two do jane eyre . by the time i got to watching the ciarin hinds version ,  i think i was jane eyred out ,  but i will never tire of those first few minutes of hearing joan fontaine's voice narrate the opening of the first version i ever saw .  i always want to go back and read the book again . 
*spoiler alert :  i wish i could discuss this without revealing specific plot points ,  but i can't .  sorry . *  i was looking for an imdb review of the george c .  scott movie when i stumbled across the summary and reviews for this version .  it had so many positive reviews that i decided to order it even though :   ( a ) while truncated and rushed ,  i thought george c .  scott embodied the tortured nature  ( and physical appearance )  of the book's rochester to a t ;  and  ( b ) even while looking at the dvd's cover ,  i was thinking  " isn't timothy dalton too good-looking for the role ?  "  the latter concern was reinforced by the fact that i decided to re-read the book while the dvd was on backorder .  that said ,  the minute i started watching this ,  i was captivated .  at first it was disconcerting to hear 1840's dialog spoken as written--with little or no attempts at modernization--but dalton and clarke threw themselves into it so thoroughly ,  that i actually enjoyed the fact that the adapters trusted the audience to follow archaic speech .  to have so much of the book up on the screen was an extra bonus .  i know someone who won't watch any versions of jane eyre because  " who wants to see a film about a man who keeps a poor crazy woman in the attic ?  "  frankly ,  if someone who hadn't read the book stumbled across the hour and a half or two hour versions ,  they would think that's pretty much all the story entails--rochester's secret and its affect on everyone around him .  luckily ,  this version is actually about jane eyre's whole life .   some people have criticized the casting .  dalton is too dashing ;  clarke is too reserved .  i can't argue against the first point ,  but he is so  " in the moment "  that i believe he is rochester .  to me ,  clarke's performance is on the mark .  jane eyre is quiet ,  guarded .  if one remembers the book ,  so much of the adult jane's fieriness and passion occurs during her private struggles .  some of the criticisms baffle me .  reviewers say clarke is too short or isn't pretty enough .  the book goes on ad infinitum about how small and plain jane is .  ms .  clarke shouldn't be tall and the filmmakers toned down her looks to make jane's declarations of her lack of beauty credible .  she can scarcely help it if dalton is tall .  some say there is no chemistry between the leads .  what ?  !  !  the scene when jane finally comes out of her room after the wedding fiasco fairly vibrates with passion and longing and sadness and regret--and that's just the first example that comes to mind .   i do agree with some of the other criticisms .  i too missed more scenes with helen burns and the rivers siblings .  some of the dialog was oddly truncated .  when rochester declares ,   " jane ,  you misjudge me .  i do not hate her because she is mad ,  "  i waited for the rest of the exchange when rochester explains how if jane were to go mad ,  he would still love and care for her .  it's a powerful moment in the book ,  and i wish it had been included .  i think it was a mistake to bring a scene with rochester into the part of the story where jane is on her own .  it might have been done for clarity's sake ,  but i found it jarring .  i wanted the sly humor of the scene where jane opines that rochester's ardor will cool and he'll become gruff again ,  but he may  " like "  her again by and by .  dalton's performance is so good that the rare misstep is glaring--when rochester weeps in the library ,  i saw him as an actor doing a crying scene ,  not as rochester .  as for the sets ,  if anyone has ever caught an episode of the 1960's show  " dark shadows ,  "  one knows what to expect--very stark and sometimes rickety looking interiors .  others have commented thoroughly and succinctly about the make-up job rochester sports at the end .  yikes !  it is bad .  the conclusion is too abrupt .  after all that anguish and suspense ,  i wanted a more rounded off ending .  and ,  on my copy of the dvd ,  having credits at the beginning and end of all eleven 25-30 minute episodes gets to be a bit much .  that said ,  i am so glad i have this film and will watch it again and again . 
i watched this in july and even with the christmas theme ,  found it touching and sensitive .  it is not for someone with a reality-mind as it is full of fantasy and lovely moments that sometimes don't make sense .  william russ did a grand job as hank .  i have only seen him in the remake of the long ,  hot summer where he played a weak character .  but in this one ,  the expression in his eyes throughout ,  as hank considered the things that were happening to him ,  was wonderful and tender .  valerie bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role .  and peter falk as max was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes .  there were many special scenes ,  including the one where hank realizes who max really was in his life .  it's not for everyone .  .  .  .  . especially those who aren't into 'feel-good' movies and this is definitely one !  if you like everything to be perfect and make sense ,  avoid this one .  but i think it is well-worth re-watching ,  which is why i taped it .   ( yes ,  some of us still have vcrs .   :  ) 
i am a jane eyre lover and a purist ,  and this version includes almost all of the important details of the book ,  and the characters are portrayed as i imagined them .  jane eyre is a complex story of great richness and can't be delivered properly in a feature-length format ,  so it needs a tv mini-series .  timothy dalton's rochester is probably the best ever .  there has been a lot of discussion about how attractive he is and his age .  in the book ,  jane  ( the narrator )  describes him as  " about 35 "  and not young ,  but not yet middle aged .  i think timothy dalton was about 38 when he made this ,  so that is about right .  also ,  we only have jane's opinion of whether rochester is handsome .  she only just met him and he asks her bluntly what she thinks .  as an inexperienced and humble girl ,  i can't imagine her saying she did think him handsome .  the actor playing rochester needs to show us the character of the man ,  and this is fulfilled to perfection .  i love the relationship between the two leads ,  which is the crucial thing about this story ,  and the humour of their encounters .  other versions have blown it ,  but this gets it right .  the 2006 version with toby stephens  ( aged 37 years )  is in progress on bbc1 and is very good indeed ,  so i will decide whether that is my favourite when it is completed .   on viewing this series again ,  after watching the 2006 version ,  i have decided that this version with timothy dalton and zelah clark is the best !  charlotte bronte's dialogue is preserved and this is essential to the power of the story .  modernisation just doesn't work - it's a victorian story and having archaic poetic speech suits the characters .  this version has an excellent cast - zelah clark is tiny and the difference in height between her and rochester is important ;  timothy dalton has real presence and is an amazing actor .  there are no extra scenes to divert from the plot and the screenplay includes all the essential scenes ,  but leaves out unnecessary details ,  making it to the point and gripping .  i recommend it to all true jane eyre fans . 
i studied charlotte bronte's novel in high school ,  and it left me with a stunning impression .  here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of victorian england .  this young woman was jane eyre ,  a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own .  her story ,  which bronte told through jane's own eyes ,  was both sad and inspiring .    as part of our study ,  we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story ,  and it blew me away .  the mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to bronte's original text and the essence of the story ,  but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great .  both zelah clarke  ( jane eyre )  and timothy dalton  ( jane's lover ,  by the name of rochester )  captured brilliantly the essence of their characters .  i cannot imagine anyone else in their roles .   ( the other performances of rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion ,  energy ,  and tenderness needed to portray rochester accurately .  i say that timothy dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of rochester .  zelah clarke not only looks like jane eyre ,  but she captures jane's quiet ,  but firm and passionate nature brilliantly .  she holds in her emotions ,  like the jane of the book ,  at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in jane's passionate scenes .  the chemistry that clarke and dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to jane and rochester's devoted relationship .  )  as well ,  the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly ,  and the sets fit the gothic nature of the story .    i strongly recommend this version of the classic bronte tale .  if you have not read the book before ,  then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story . 
i think this is a great version ,  i came on here before ,  to help me find which version i should use and i went to jane eyre 1983 and read a comment from users comment and then helped me to get this version .  i do not regret picking this version and neither will you .  i tried watching all the other versions and none matched up to it , there is nothing like the book , and trust me if you are reading the book you want something that is going to match up with it .  when you are looking for something real and moving after you have read the book it is hard because you want something that is going to match up with that .  i would say god personally led me to this version .  it points to true love for a humans .  i would say god's love is greater . if there is anything better ,  i would like to see it .  but so far there is none like it ! 
there have been many film and tv productions of jane eyre each with aspects to recommend them ,  but i suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now .  it's just a classic  ( and offers much more of the story than others do )  .  timothy dalton is utterly in his element as rochester ,  rarely missing the mark ;  his performance is astonishingly nimble and many-colored ,  while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character .  zelah clarke's jane is more cerebral than otherworldly ,  but she makes a perfect foil for dalton  ( who ,  appropriately ,  towers over her !  )  the nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing  ( once you've absorbed the shock of dalton's charisma )  .  there are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better ;  though this pretty much was a top-of-the-line production by the bbc's standards of that time .  but ,  it's the performances that are the real pleasure .  don't miss this one ! 
there are many adaptations of charlotte brontë's classic novel  " jane eyre "  ,  and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best .  the short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a 100 min .  length ,  consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel .  the tv series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the heroine's life .   there are three tv mini series ,  released in '73 ,  '83 and 2006 .  the 2006 version is not only the worst of these three ,  but the worst of all jane eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film .  the novel's beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones ,  and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel .  what it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the rochester and jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book ,  but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set .  it is a silly soap opera ,  in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the 1850ies by mistake .  this  " jane eyre "   ( as it dares to call itself )  is indeed a slap in the face of charlotte brontë .   the 1973 version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between mr .  rochester and jane are rendered in nearly their full length .  but what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen .  at times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen ,  and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by jane's voice-overs add to the impression of artificiality and staginess .  and despite the faithfulness to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured .  another problem is the casting of the main characters .  sorcha cusack's portrayal of jane as a bold ,  self-confident ,  worldly-wise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model ,  and michael jayston ,  although a good actor ,  does simply not possess the commanding physical presence nor the charisma necessary to play rochester .  although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audience .   all the faults of the '73 version stand corrected in the tv mini series of '83 with timothy dalton and zelah clarke .  although from a purist's point of view timothy dalton is too handsome ,  tall and lean to be rochester ,  he possesses the essential qualities for the role :  he has an imposing physical presence ,  great magnetism and an air of self-assurance and authority .  and despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of thornfield convincingly .  but the excellence of his performance lies in the way he renders all the facets of rochester's character .  of all the actors who have played rochester he is the only one to capture them all :  rochester's harshness ,  nearly insolence ,  his moodiness and abruptness ,  as well as his humorous side ,  his tenderness ,  his solicitude and deep ,  frantic love .  dalton's handling of charlotte brontë's language is equally superb .  even rochester's most far-fetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when dalton delivers them .  he is the definitive rochester ,  unsurpassed and unsurpassable ,  and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actor .   zelah clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of rochester .  she portrays exactly the jane of the novel ,  an outwardly shy ,  reserved and guarded young woman ,  but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will .  she catches beautifully the duality in jane's character :  her modesty and respectfulness on the one hand ,  and her fire and passion on the other ,  her seeming frailty and her indomitable sense of right and wrong .  she and dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delight .   as regards faithfulness to the literary model this version also quotes verbatim from the novel as does the '73 version ,  but with one important difference :  the dialogues are shortened in this version ,  but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered unchanged .  thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech ,  while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of charlotte brontë's language .  and in contrast to the earlier bbc version the essence of each scene is perfectly captured .   the plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the '73 series .  it is nearly a scene for scene enactment of the novel ,  where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of jane's life .  it is the only jane eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel ,  and the only one which does full justice to the novel's pivotal and most heartrending scene when jane and rochester meet after the aborted wedding .  timothy dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill .  he renders with almost painful intensity rochester's anguish as he realizes jane's resolution to leave him ,  his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him .  it is a heartbreaking ,  almost devastating ,  scene ,  which will stay with the viewer for a long time .   with even the smaller roles perfectly cast ,  an excellent script and two ideal leading actors this is the definitive and only true  " jane eyre "  . 
this review comes nearly 30 years late .  nevertheless ,  it has to be mentioned that i chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months straight !  i just had to write about it !  i got smitten and forgot anything else existed once i saw this movie .  how ironic it is to see literature's ugliest male protagonist portrayed by the handsomest man !  yet ,  what a welcome irony !  it suited me perfectly and more so because timothy dalton did full justice to his role .  he delivered an astounding and triumphant performance !  i have never seen anything like it !  all the other actors are very good too .  the whole movie was put together beautifully .  i don't care what anyone says about this movie .  i just love it and love it !  it made me happy and satisfied .  it crushes me a bit to say this but i prefer jane eyre 1983 to a&e's p&j ,  which i believe is the ultimate mini-series .    the excerpts from jane eyre spooked me a little back in school .  i never got around to reading the book seriously knowing the story line so well .  seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy .  the scenes and mr .  dalton's voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously ,  which ,  of course is a masterpiece .  bravo to the whole team and especially to mr . dalton !  !  this movie is now a part of me .   i give it 10/10 rating . 
i have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel  " jane eyre "  .  both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane .  i've seen other versions ,  but none compare to this one .  the best one for me .  i could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again .  the last time i saw this one was in 1984 when i was only 13 .  at that time ,  i was a bookworm and i had just read charlotte bronte's novel .  i was completely enchanted by this miniseries and i remember not missing any of the episodes .  i'd like to see it again because it's so good .   : - ) 
i really have to say ,  this was always a favorite of mine when i went to see my grandma .  and it still is .  it is very ,  very close to the book .  the way it is filmed ,  and the players were just all excellent !  i have to recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it .  almost everyone i talk to hates tv movies ,  but this was really great !  i gave it 10/10 . 
this is the best version  ( so far )  that you will see and the most true to the bronte work .  dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared  " not handsome "  .  but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark ,  pretty as she is ,  is also a complete and believable jane eyre .  this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it .  nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true 'romance' in literature ,  this is the way to see it .  i own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original .  the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this . 
i felt duty bound to watch the 1983 timothy dalton / zelah clarke adaptation of  " jane eyre ,  "  because i'd just written an article about the 2006 bbc  " jane eyre "  for thescreamonline .   so ,  i approached watching this the way i'd approach doing homework .   i was irritated at first .  the lighting in this version is bad .  everyone / everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that ,  in some scenes ,  casts shadows on the wall behind the characters .   and the sound is poorly recorded .  i felt like i was listening to a high school play .   and the pancake make-up is way too heavy .   and the sets don't fully convey the gothic mood of the novel .  they are too fussy ,  too martha stewart .  i just can't see bronte's rochester abiding such martha stewart domestic arrangements .  orson welles' rochester lived in cave-like gloom ,  very appropriate to the novel's gothic mood .   and yet  .  .  .  with all those objections  .  .  .  not only is this the best  " jane eyre "  i've seen ,  it may be the best adaptation of any novel i've ever seen .   this  " jane eyre ,  "  in spite of its technical flaws ,  brought the feeling back to me of reading  " jane eyre "  for the first time .   the critics of this production say it is too close to the book .  for me ,  someone who valued the book and didn't need it to be any less  " wordy "  or any less  " christian "  or any more sexed up ,  this version's faithfulness to the novel bronte actually wrote is its finest asset .   bronte wrote a darn good book .  there's a reason it has lasted 150 years plus ,  while other ,  slicker ,  sexier and easier texts ,  have disappeared .   as a long time  " jane eyre "  fan ,  i was prejudiced against timothy dalton as rochester .  rochester is ,  famously ,  not handsome ;  jane and rochester are literature's famous ugly couple .  and timothy dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome .   but dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as rochester .  he just blew me away .  i've never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role ,  the text ,  the dialogue ,  and rochester's love for jane .  dalton brings the page's rochester to quivering life on screen .   rochester is meant to be a bit scary .  dalton is scary .  welles got the scary streak down ,  too ,  for example ,  when he shouts  " enough !  "  after fontaine plays a short piano piece .  but dalton is scary more than once ,  here .  you really can't tell if he's going to hurt jane ,  or himself ,  in his desperation .   rochester's imperiousness ,  his humor ,  his rage ,  his vulnerability :  dalton conveys all ,  sometimes seconds apart .  it's stunning .   and here's the key thing -- the actor performing rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair ,  lonely ,  living with an ugly ,  life-destroying secret .   no other actor i've seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as timothy dalton does .  current fan favorite toby stephens doesn't even try .  dalton hits it out of the park .  if i saw timothy dalton performing rochester in a singles bar ,  i would say ,   " that guy is trouble .  don't even look at him .  "  he's that radioactive with tamped down agony .   zelah clarke is not only ,  overall ,  the best jane i've seen ,  she's one of the very few janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts jane .  no ,  folks who know  " jane eyre "  only from the 2006 version ,  bronte did *not* describe a statuesque ,  robust jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips .  rather ,  charlotte bronte's jane is ,  indeed ,  poor ,  plain ,  obscure ,  and little ,  and not pretty .   zelah has a small mouth ,  close-set eyes ,  and a bit of a nose .  she's truly  " little .  "  she is no fashion model .  and she is the best jane ,  the truest to the book .   some described her a cold or boring .  no ,  she's true to the book .  bronte's jane is not a red hot mama ,  she's a sheltered ,  deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments ,  as zelah's do here .  the book's jane is someone you have to watch slowly ,  carefully ,  patiently ,  observantly ,  if you want to truly plumb her depths .  you have to watch zelah ,  here ,  to get to know who she really is .   i would have liked to have seen more fire in zelah in one key scene ,  but that's one scene out of five hours in which she is ,  otherwise ,  very good .   in spite of its closeness to the text ,  this version ,  like every other version i've seen ,  shys away from fully explicating the overtly christian themes in  " jane eyre .  "  christianity is not incidental subtext in  " jane eyre ,  "  it is central .   helen burns instructs jane in christianity ,  thus giving her a subversive ,  counter cultural way to read ,  and live ,  her apparently doomed ,  pinched life .  it is christianity ,  and a christian god ,  who convinces poor ,  plain ,  obscure jane of her equal worth ,  her need to live up to her ideals ,  and her rejection of a key marriage proposal .  that isn't made fully clear here .   in any case ,  charlotte bronte wrote an excellent ,  complex ,  rich novel ,  and this adaptation of it ,  of all the ones i've seen ,  mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation i've seen ,  and that says a lot .   other versions ,  that don't fully honor the book ,  end up being a chore to watch in many places .  if you don't care about what charlotte bronte has to say about child abuse ,  or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money ,  your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between jane and rochester .   this version ,  like bronte's novel ,  realizes that everything bronte wrote -- about jane's experiences at lowood ,  and her relationship to st .  john -- are part of what makes jane's relationship to rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is .

i had no idea what jane eyre was before i saw this miniseries .  i had read and watched many classics before ,  and i believed that most classics were boring ,  over-worded ,  and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best .  this jane eyre miniseries completely changed my conceptions .   zelah clarke is a fabulous actress ,  and she gives a wonderful portrayal of jane eyre .  her accent is delightful and her quiet ,  yet firm nature matches the young governess' character exactly .  timothy dalton is an amazing rochester .  his passion and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the brooding master of thornfield hall .  i couldn't sleep at all the night after i had watched this miniseries .  the plot is both haunting and inspiring .  the characters are masterfully performed ,  and the story is incredible .  this is the best version of jane eyre to ever appear on film .   i read the book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed charolette bronte's writing .  jane eyre is now my favorite film and book .  if you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life ,  watch the 1983 bbc version of jane eyre . 
those who love the book jane eyre as i do  ( it's my all time favorite ,  and i re read it at least once a year )  will love this version .  timothy dalton is just a tad too good looking to be mr .  rochester ,  but other than that ,  he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of thornfield .  zelah clarke may have been just a little too old to play the 18 year old jane ,  but when i watch this movie ,  i don't think about the ages of the characters .  the dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book ,  which was very smart .  sure ,  this film might seem a little long ,  but it's the only version i've seen that includes part 3 of the story .   i wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer zeferelli version ,  as it would have helped that mess of a film .   i also realized the last time i watched this video that judy cornwell plays  " aunt reed "  !  she is so versatile that i didn't recognize her .  she plays daisy in keeping up appearances ,  and also played mrs .  musgrove in 1995's persuasion  ( another wonderful adaption )  .   update :  got the dvd this week ,  and it's marvelous to see the original unedited version .  there's lots more at the beginning  ( young jane at gateshead and at lowood .  )  and at the end ,  they've restored lots of things ,   ( i always wondered why st .  john had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who jane is-- because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the us vhs version !  )  .  rosamund oliver is in it .  .  . she was completely cut out of the vhs .  as far as i could tell ,  they hadn't edited out any of timothy dalton's parts ,  so nothing new there ,  but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the vhs .  thanks ,  bbc  ( ps .  .  . i would have paid more for a special edition dvd .  .  . with maybe some interviews with the stars .  .  . or a making of show ) 
this wonderful 1983 bbc television production  ( not a movie ,  as others have written here )  of the classic love story  " jane eyre "  ,  starring timothy dalton as rochester ,  and zelah clarke as jane ,  is the finest version that has been made to date ,  since it is the most faithful to the novel by charlotte bronte in both concept and dialogue .    a classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons ;  when film producers start to meddle with a classic's very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed .  thankfully the producers of this  " jane eyre "  approached the story with respect and faithfulness towards the original ,  which results in a spectacularly addictive concoction that is worth viewing multiple times ,  to enjoy its multi-layers of sweetness and delight and suspense .  the performances are delightful ,  the music is just right ,  even the gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful ,  and set the right tone for the production .    my only criticism ,  though slight ,  is that this version ,  like every other version ever made of jane eyre ,  ignores the christian influences that built jane's character and influenced her moral choices .  in today's modern world a woman in jane's situation wouldn't think twice but to stay with rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her .   " oh ,  just get a divorce "  ,  she would say to her man ,  or she would live in sin with him .  but jane eyre knew she couldn't settle for this course in life and respect herself .  why ?  this decision was based on the foundations of the christian faith she had been taught since childhood ,  not from the brutal calvinist lowood institution ,  but from the christian example of a true friend ,  helen burns ,  who was martyred rather than not turn the other cheek .  someday i would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation .  a classic novel that ends with the heroine writing  " even so ,  come lord jesus !  "  should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it . 
yes ,  this production is long  ( good news for bronte fans !  )  and it has a somewhat dated feel ,  but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you won't want to watch any other versions !   timothy dalton is edward rochester .  .  .  it's that simple .  i don't care that other reviewers claim he's too handsome .  dalton is attractive ,  certainly ,  but no pretty-boy .  in fact he possesses a craggy ,  angular dark charm that ,  in my mind ,  is quite in keeping with the mysterious ,  very masculine mr r .  and he takes on rochester's sad ,  tortured persona so poignantly .  he portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it ,  but also displays rochester's tender ,  passionate ,  emotional side as well .   ( imo the newer a&e production suffers in that ciaran hinds - whom i normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout .  i've read the book many times and i never felt that rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast .  )   when i reread the novel ,  i always see zelah clarke as jane .  ms .  clarke ,  to me ,  resembles jane as she describes herself  ( and is described by others )  .  small ,  childlike ,  fairy .  .  .  though it's true the actress doesn't look 18 ,  she portrays jane's attributes so well .  while other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional ,  one must remember that the character spent 8 years at lowood being trained to hold her emotions and  " passionate nature "  in check .  her main inspiration was her childhood friend helen ,  who was the picture of demure submission .  although her true nature was dissimilar ,  jane learned to master her temper and appear docile ,  in keeping with the school's aims for its charity students who would go into 'service' .  jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich mr .  rochester .  she would certainly *not* speak to him as an equal .  even later on when she gave as well as she got ,  she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer .  nevertheless ,  if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles zelah-as-jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-tempered .   the chemistry between dalton and clarke is just right ,  i think .  no ,  it does not in the least resemble hollywood  ( thank god !  it's not a hollywood sort of book )  but theirs is a romance which is true ,  devoted and loyal .  and for a woman like jane ,  who never presumed to have *any* love come her way ,  it is a minor miracle .   the rest of the casting is terrific ,  and i love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here .  so ,  too ,  is much of the rich ,  poetic original dialogue .  this version is the only one that i know of to include the lovely ,  infamous 'gypsy scene' and in general ,  features more humor than other versions i've seen .  in particular ,  the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful !   jane eyre was ,  in many ways ,  one of the first novelized feminists .  she finally accepted love on her own terms and independently ,  and ,  at last ,  as rochester's true equal .  just beautiful ! 
double exposure was a tremendous surprise .  it contains outstanding acting  ( particularly from the underrated callan )  ,  fine cinematography and a compelling storyline .  in other words ,  it's one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s .   callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models ,  at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically volatile brother  ( who happens to be missing an arm and a leg )  .  when the models callan dreams about killing actually turn up dead ,  the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity .  .  .  but there is more to the picture than he is seeing .   this film never received the praise it deserves .  most critics and filmgoers lump it in with the horde of slasher films released at the same time ,  but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot .  it's clever and unique ,  which isn't something one can comfortably say about most films of this genre ,  but it's also passionately crafted and performed .  double exposure is a gem of its kind . 
troubled men's magazine photographer adrien wilde  ( well played with considerable intensity by michael callan )  has horrific nightmares in which he brutally murders his models .  when the lovely ladies start turning up dead for real ,  adrien worries that he might be the killer .  writer/director william byron hillman relates the engrossing story at a steady pace ,  builds a reasonable amount of tension ,  delivers a few gruesomely effective moments of savage misogynistic violence  ( one woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake in it placed over her head rates as the definite squirm-inducing highlight )  ,  puts a refreshing emphasis on the nicely drawn and engaging true-to-life characters ,  further grounds everything in a plausible everyday world ,  and tops things off with a nice smattering of tasty female nudity .  the fine acting from an excellent cast helps matters a whole lot :  joanna pettet as sunny ,  charming love interest mindy jordache ,  james stacy as adrien's macho double amputee brother b . j .  ,  seymour cassel as adrien's concerned psychiatrist dr .  frank curtis ,  don potter as adrien's feisty gay assistant louis ,  pamela hensley as gutsy homicide detective sergeant fountain ,  cleavon little as a hard-nosed police chief ,  and misty rowe as sweet ,  bubbly model bambi .  r .  michael stringer's polished cinematography makes impressive occasional use of breathtaking panoramic aerial shots .  jack goga's ominous rattling score likewise does the trick .  popping up in cool bit parts are robert tessier as a gruff bartender ,  sally kirkland as a saucy hooker ,  kathy shower as a fierce female wrestler b . j .  grapples with in the ring ,  and frances bay in one of her standard old woman roles .  a solid and enjoyable picture . 
to call this episode brilliant feels like too little .  to say it keeps up the excellent work of the season premiere is reductive too ,  'cause there's never been a far-from-great sopranos episode so far .  in fact ,  the title might be a smug invitation for those who aren't real fans yet :  join the club .  .  .   picking up where junior left off  ( putting a bullet in his nephew's gut after mistaking him for a crook he killed in the first season )  ,  the story begins with tony being absolutely fine .  with no recollection whatsoever of what happened to him ,  he's attending some kind of convention .  only he's not speaking with his normal accent ,  and there seems to be something wrong with his papers :  apparently ,  he is not tony soprano but kevin finnerty ,  or at least that's what a group of people think ,  and until the mess is sorted out he can't leave his hotel .   naturally ,  in pure sopranos tradition ,  that turns out to be nothing but a dream :  tony is actually in a coma ,  with the doctors uncertain regarding his fate ,  his family and friends worried sick and junior refusing to believe the whole thing actually happened .  unfortunately it did ,  and anthony jr .  looks willing to avenge the attempt on his father's life .   dreams have popped up rather frequently in the series ,  often as some kind of spiritual trial for the protagonists  ( most notably in the season five show the test dream )  .  join the club ,  however ,  takes the metaphysical qualities of the program ,  already hinted at by the previous episode's use of a william s .  burroughs poem ,  and pushes the envelope in the most audacious way :  tony hallucinating about his dead friends  ( the first occurrence of the sort was caused by food poisoning ,  four seasons ago )  is one thing ,  him actually being in what would appear to be purgatory is radically different .  the  " heavenly "  section of the story is crammed with allegorical significances ,  not least the name tony is given  ( as one character points out ,  spelling it in a certain way will give you the word  " infinity "  )  ,  and none of it comes off as overblown or far-fetched :  david chase has created a piece of work that is far too intelligent to use weird set-ups just for their own sake ;  it all helps the narrative .  talking about  " help from above "  in the case of tony soprano might be stretching it a tad ,  though . 
its too bad a lot of people didn't understand this and the next episode .   but don't worry !  ill explain it too you  :  )   this episode is split in 2 parts .   first part is tony's  " dream "  in his coma .  second part is what happens in real life .   now what people didn't understand is that tony's dream is more then just a dream .  in this episode its about his preparation for his death .  he loses his own identity and eventually even forgets himself ,  thus he disconnects all his bindings with this world .  you will notice what i'm saying at the doctor scene ,  where tony says he has lost his briefcase which contains  " his life "  .  they makers really did a superb job of interpreting they're own thoughts of what happens when you die .    if you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode an unique thing ,  with great spiritual meanings .   like every sopranos episode the acting and filming is superb .    only thing i didn't understand was what the role where of the monks .  gonna re watch it till i get this .   anyways this episode really touched me ,  and i don't think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experience .   10/10 no doubt . 
let me start off by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on dvd at 10 o'clock p . m .  one night ,  i could not fall asleep until about 3 : 00 a . m .   this brief review may contain spoilers .   i'm a long-time fan of the sopranos and i can safely say this is the best episode i've seen .  i'm not saying everyone should feel this way ,  but i do .  this episode is identical to the weekend i spent with my family ,  watching over my own father ,  comatose in the icu before he passed .   the episode begins with tony in an alternate reality :  he is a salesman who's identity has been mistaken for that of a man named kevin finnerty .   by the time ten minutes had gone by ,  i knew either tony was dreaming ,  or i was watching some other show .  it wasn't like the normal sopranos and i loved it .   option 1 is confirmed when anthony  ( or  " kevin "  )  looks into the sky at a  " helicopter spotlight "  and we see prodding through it ,  a doctor with a flashlight .  we see this only for a moment and the sequence plays out until we go back to real life in a situation similar to the one i just stated .   tony has come out of the coma for only a moment .  his boys take a . j .  home and carmella ,  overcome by stress ,  breaks down in the hallway :  a signature moment in the episode .   for the remainder of the episode ,  we cut in between the real world :  the family dealing with the potential negative outcome of this coma ,  and tony's alternate reality ,  which parallels what's going on both in his mind and in the real world around him .   then comes the stellar point in the episode :  after a . j .  finishes telling his mother he's flunked school ,  she walks in to see meadow sitting at anthony's side .   she approaches tony ,  and utters the best line of the episode :   " anthony ,  can you hear us ?  "  in tony's world ,  he enters a dark hotel room and turns on a light .  he takes off his shoes and goes to the phone .  he tries to dial ,  but he cannot--as if he were trying to say something back to carmella ,  but couldn't physically bring himself to do so .  not yet .   he sits down and looks out his window .  a shimmering light that has reoccurred throughout the episode now seems to call to him from the other side of the city .    " when it's cold i'd like to die "  by moby marries perfectly with these last images and helps in creating an emotional roller-coaster of an episode .   10 out of 10 .   p . s .  :  watch the next episode .  you find out what the light is .  it's wonderful . 
generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending ;  the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their persons .  i especially liked the plot ,  although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie .  however ,  i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer  ( extended maybe ) - to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit ;  as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell .  for instance- what happened to tristan's brother ,  hayden ?  for all we know he died in the hospital .  maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing ?  !  who knows !  maybe there will be a sequel ?  maybe ?  if there is .  .  i cant wait to see it . 
with the badly injured tony in an induced coma ,  two things happen :  tony imagines himself leading the life of a salesman attending a business convention ,  while his family and friends go through hell trying to cope with the possible loss of the big man .  the dream sequences are right out of an old twilight zone episode ,  as tony finds himself transformed into an average joe trying to deal with a missing wallet and mixed-up identities while on a cross-country business trip .  his intonation as a blazer- and khaki-wearing schnook is more mid-american and less that of an italian thug from noo joisey .  a nice touch .  the shockingly long-haired ,  hippy-dippy aj  ( whom paulie calls  " van helsing "  at one point )  has a nice scene with his comatose old man .  the best moment has the big boys trying to talk about life without tony ,  which immediately breaks down into a territorial dispute .  vito gets off a line about the new-dead gene possibly having been a closet case ,  which is interesting in light of what we are about to learn about vito . 
okay ,  i didn't get the purgatory thing the first time i watched this episode .  it seemed like something significant was going on that i couldn't put my finger on .  this time those costa mesa fires on tv really caught my attention- and it helped that i was just writing an essay on inferno !  but let me see what hasn't been discussed yet .  .  .   a twop review mentioned that tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator .  yeah ,  7 is a significant number for lots of reasons ,  especially religious ,  but here's one more for ya .  on a hunch i consulted wikipedia ,  and guess what dante divided into 7 levels ?  purgatorio .  excluding ante-purgatory and paradise .   ( the stuff at the bottom of the stairs and .  .  .  what tony can't get to .  )    on to the allegedly  " random "  monk-slap scene .  as soon as the monks appeared ,  it fit perfectly in place with tony trying to get out of purgatory .  you can tell he got worried when that christian commercial  ( death ,  disease ,  and sin )  came on ,  and he's getting more and more desperate because christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him .  by the time he meets the monks he's thinking  " hey maybe these guys can help me ?  "  which sounds like contemplating other religions  ( e . g .  buddhism )  and wondering if some other path could take him to  " salvation "  .  not that tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a buddhist ,  but it appears finnerty tried that  ( and messed up )  .  that slap in the face basically tells tony there's no quick fix- as in ,  no ,  you can't suddenly embrace buddhism and get out of here .    tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven .  but at the  " conference entrance "  ,  he realizes that's not going to be so easy for him .  at first i saw the name vs .  driver's license problem as tony having led sort of a double life ,  what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people .  he feels free to have an affair with quasi-melfi because  " he's kevin finnerty "  .  he figures out that he can fool some people with kf's cards ,  like hotel receptionists ,  but it won't get him out of purgatory .  those helicopters- the helicopters of heaven ? - are keeping track of him and everything he does .   after reading all the theories on  " infinnerty "  ,  though ,  it seems like kf's identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths tony could've taken in his life .  possibly along with the car joke involving infiniti's that made no sense to me otherwise .  aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out . 
let's start this review out on a positive note -- i am very glad they didn't decide to wimp out with tony being shot and do a retrospective season like some people were rumoring .  actually ,  creator and writer of this episode david chase did quite the opposite .  we don't actually know if tony will live or die .  he's in a coma and his chances of recovering are very slim to none .  this episode seemed to move very slow ,  and the coma induced dream tony was in involving mistaken identity and robed asian monks slapping the sh*t out of him was absolutely ,  flat-out weird .  after 45-minutes i got a little sick of everyone grieving ,  but that shouldn' t be a reason to slam this episode .  it was a weird and unpredictable episode ,  but it was still well-written and intense .  edie falco gave an astounding career-defining performance in this episode as the conflicted wife having to face with her husband's could-be demise .  i also found it interesting aj dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against junior ,  which aj most likely won't have the balls to pull off .  silvio is now acting-boss which opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes .  there were a lot of great quips in this episode ,  also ,  and i think vito 'pole-smoker' spadafore may meet his demise if he keeps being a greedy s . o . b .   this wasn't a great episode and disappointed only because even though tony kills people ,  we as an audience adore him and feel he is our hero of the show .  this was a necessary episode for the series ,  even though it was a little snore inducing towards the conclusion .  kudos to edie falco's performance ,  and david chase and the writers for creating this wholly original and unpredictable plot twist .  this is the only season of 'the sopranos' where i haven't a f*cking clue where it is going to go .  i can't wait for next week's episode .  my rating :  7 . 5/10   best line of the episode :   ( paulie to aj )  :   " let's go ,  van helsing !  " 
it holds very true to the original manga of the same name ,  aka  ( tramps like us in the u . s )  but it can still be enjoyed even if you haven't read the manga .  it's a different kind of tail ,  showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else .  however ,  because of her outward strength ,  she fears showing her inner feelings and thus let's those around her hurt her with their blunt comments .  the only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new pet .  .  . human .  .  . momo .  if you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful j-dorama  ( japanese drama )  actors/resses then this is definitely the series to watch .  .  . and read ! 
i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year .  i found it in the internet when i was looking for sub-titled dramas to help me with my japanese .  my host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird ,  but i found it delightful !  koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and matsujun's spirit made my day every time i tuned in !  i first saw him on  " hana yori dango "  ,  but i liked him much better in this !   although the characters are interesting and well-developed ,  i was disappointed to find that they didn't change very much throughout the show .  their relationship grew ,  but they didn't really .  still ,  a fun time had by all  ( even for fukushima !  )  . 
i don't give a movie or a show ten very often but this show touched a nerve in a way no other show has .  i found the entire series on mysoju . com and thought the premise looked interesting so i took a look see .  i wasn't disappointed in what i saw ;  i was moved .  this story stays on the tender side as the main characters move us through the scenes .  sumire iwaya ,  played thoughtfully by koyuki ,  shows us human nature as she wants to keep troubles from being shown .  no one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate .  so instead she substitutes a human ,  played by an adorable matsumoto jun ,  as a pet .  this pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet .  the difference ;  he can retaliate in the same way ,  after all momo is a man ,  not a dog .  as he is treated like a pet ,  he reacts to situations how a dog might react .  she spends time with the new boyfriend ,  momo gets jealous .  it's when she realizes that her pet isn't just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick - momo is a dance prodigy .  her thinking slowly changes as we start to get a glance at his own thoughts .  matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one dimensional in the beginning ,  to two dimensional when we see he's a dancer ,  to a three dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master as a man ,  not as a dog .  in my opinion ,  it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop .  plus matsumoto plays momo with such tenderness you almost start to wish you had one too .  neither wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change ,  but as momo  ( the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy )  states  we both knew this wasn't going to be able to last .  watch this show with a open mind ,  it's worth it . 
kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment one day .  she decides to bring him in and fix his cuts .  she then leaves a note for him to eats some food she made then go home because she had to go to work .  when she gets home however she finds that he is still there .  he tells her that he wants to live there with her like a brother or cousin .  in desperation to get him to leave she tells him that if he became her pet then he could stay .  and as a pet she says that he would have no rights and do whatever she told him .   ( not in that perverted way !  )  to her surprise he agrees and from then on he is known as momo ,  her pet . 
this is actually a groovy-neat little flick ,  made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video crinkliness  .  it takes a little while to warm up to it .  the acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen-like charm .  after a few scenes ,  you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries .  the characters all develop a quirky charm ,  especially  " richard "  .  forget anthony hopkins ,  maidens is the guy i'd hire to play a raving psychopath .  he just seems to enjoy it so very much !  mixed in with the scenes of mad-slasher gore and zombie infestation are some truly visually effective shots of the title character ,   " the midnight skater "  zooming through the campus in a black hoodie ,  looking for all the world like a cross between the grim reaper and ,  say ,  the silver surfer .  these shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the skater seem almost ominous .  the soundtrack features some very fun garage-punk tunes and the raspy ,  raucous meanness of it meshes well with the film's mood .  thumbs upish ,  i say . 
b movie ?  yes .  diy ?  yes .  first movie ?  yes .  but aestheically a+ .  this movie definitely had some bad sound/editing/lighting/acting/etc .  etc .  problems .  however ,  this movie has many positive things about it .  first off ,  the most annoying character dies first !  second ,  its made to be a parody/funny b rated horror movie .  the comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing .   the problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece .  take it for what it is ,  a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie .  for what it is ,  just that ,  it is really good . 
having been a fan of 'columbo' ,  i was sorely disappointed in 'corky romano' .  while certainly a funny movie ,  falk's mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant he's played for so many years ,  especially with the offensive language he used .  after 'corky romano' ,  i was honestly both surprised by and soured on mr .  peter falk .  however ,  having just seen 'finding john christmas' and its predecessor ,  'a town without christmas' ,  for the first time within a week of each other ,  i have to say that 'max' ,  peter's falk's delightful character in both movies ,  is surely as memorable and lovable as 'columbo' .  while parts of the movie are quite predictable ,  such scenes in no way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out .  i too wish i had recorded both of these heartwarming christmas movies ,  and i highly recommend them whether you're a falk fan ,  a christmas nut ,  or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feel-good movie of the week .  this movie may end up lost among the throngs of made-for-tv holiday flicks ,  so be sure to find 'finding john christmas' before it's too late . 
dead to rights is about a police officer named jack slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him . jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father .   several months later on the day jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder . jack's search leads him through a trail of *beep* that doesn't end until everyone is dead .   through out the game jack uses weapons from m4 carbines to his dog shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels . the game play is basically  " kill 30 people , find switch to open door . kill 50 people , find switch to open door "  over and over until the level is done . there are fun mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a night club so jack can get to another area in the club , or bomb disarming .   dead to rights is also a hard game . you will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with sub machine guns while you only have a pistol . near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck .   dead to rights is as gory as it is hard . if you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls , ceiling and floor . and since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood .   family fun for everyone . 
i've read countless of posts about this game being so similar to max payne ,  when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcade-like game with a desire to rip-off the max payne style  ( not just bullet-time )  .  so when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is !  and how different from  " max payne "  ,  yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game-style .  this game is non-stop action - a mix between a shoot'em up and a fight'em up ,  so much fun ,  as a big fan of max payne i must say that the storyline of dtr is not near to the greatness of max payne ,  the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same ,  but if you want a bit more of that  " bullet-time "  you should definitely own this game . 
this cute animated short features two comic icons - betty boop and henry .   henry is the bald ,  slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks .   well here he does speak !   he wants to get a puppy from betty boop's pet store ,  and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue .   betty sings a song about pets ,  henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey ,  but everything works out in the end . 
dev anand  ( or prashant )  and zeenat aman  (  jasbir/janice )  are siblings brought up in single parent families .  jasbir  ( the sister )  grows up in an affluent environment but this is not enough to lead her to reject her life and ultimately join a hippie movement that eventually leads her to drugs .  prashant  ( the brother )  on the other hand grows up in a less affluent environment but grows up to be a matured gentleman .  the story marks prashant making efforts to save his little sister  ( who is perpetually in a trance )  from a hostile hippie environment .  this movie stands the test of time ,  commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up on their lives when they should instead stand up and be counted in the face of adversity .  great music compositions in this movie that mean different things in different situations and to different people ,  and the director brings forth an eerie feeling to it . 
one must admit ,  that dev has an eye for beauty and talent .  he gave a break to zeenat aman ,  a successful model ,  and also former winner of beauty pageant's title ,  by casting her in a role ,  which was tailor-made for her debut .  her bespectacled  ,  stoned look ,  and her swaying at the hypnotizing music ,  made her an instant darling of the viewers .  this movie is a treat to the eyes ,  with it's scenic locales ,  ethnic people ,  those buddha temples ,  and chirpy ,  naughty mumtaz ,  who looks quite attractive ,  in her ethnic wear ,  and dancing skills .  dev is of course ,  adorable ,  and this is one of his commercially successful performance .  hare rama manages to keep the interest going ,  with it's carefully written script ,  editing ,  and captivating music .  like des pardes ,  his another movie ,  anand has handled the topic of youngsters falling in the habit of drug addiction ,  and the theory of them coming from disturbed families ,  and troubled childhood ,  is quite plausible .  a good entertainer ,  this movie retains it's freshness till date  ! 
this is one of the movies of dev anand who gave great yet distinct movies to hindi movie industries such as jewel thief and guide .  the story is short  ( if you ask me what is the story )  ,  plot is simple- a brother seeks for his lost sister .  sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant hare rama hare krishna .  yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70's . hippie culture ,  their submission to drugs ,  freedom  , escaping duty ,  family ,  and adopting anything new such as eastern  ( which was new for whites )  religion .  they have been handled perfectly .  zeenat gave her best and dev as usual was remarkable .  songs are the best used  ( unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs )  in this movie .  they have not been spoiled . one perfect example is 'dekho o deewano .  .  . ram ka naam badnam na karo' .  each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful .  the end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie .  overall devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here .  a must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful nepal of 70's . 
the story for hare rama hare krishna actually came to dev anand's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous prem pujari in calcutta .  he was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt prem pujari's posters .  but the life of hippies re ignited a story in dev's mind to be made into a film .   this was dev anand's perhaps best directorial effort .  the film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and zeenat aman as dev's sister made a tremendous impact .   this film was dev anand's call to the nation to keep up their moral values .   it is about a montereal based indian family and the brother's role is a very affectionate one for his sister .  but the parents quarrel and separate leaving prashant ( dev )  with mother and jasbir ( zeenat )  with father .  she is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see prashant again .   she is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home .  dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that jasbir is in kathmandu with certain hippies .   to reunite with his sister ,  dev travels to kathmandu and meets shanti ( mumtaz )  who was to later marry him and also janice who in reality is jasbir with a new name and new identity .  she has forgotten her childhood and dev too .   dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in kathmandu and the people are after his life .   this was a story well directed and acted-both by dev anand .  we see more of zeenat aman than of mumtaz .  but the music by rahul dev burman was well composed .  dev had first offered the music to be composed by sachin dev burman but burman da did not want dev to do the film .  he was very close to dev and his earlier film prem pujari ,  though was good ,  but had been opposed in calcutta .  burman da wanted dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite people's anger against dev .  but dev continued with the film reassuring burman da and the film was indeed a success .   r d burman had asha bhosle sing the award winning dum maro dum .  kanchi re kanchi re was another good number .   overall it is a good film . 
this one grew on me .  i love the r . d .  burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story i found much to be moved by as i kept re-watching the movie .  the brother-sister plot line is powerful ,  i thought ;  there's also more probably obligatory stuff ,  like bar fights ,  a loony crime story ,  etc .  that are just distracting .   ( though not unfunny from a certain point of view .  )  also the english translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch ,  and as loony as it is i am grateful to him for doing it .   like many of the bollywood movies i've seen ,  this one is melodramatic and opera-like ,  including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister ,  and then the same song sung 12 or so years later by the man who has travelled to kathmandu seeking to re-connect with this girl ,  grown up and troubled  ( she had been told her brother and mother were dead )  ,  numbing her pain with drugs .   a super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement ,  which brought hordes of seekers to india ,  from an indian point of view ,  that sees them as people driven to india by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failings of their own societies ,  but nonetheless ,  in india ,  living only for the pleasures of the moment .  the hippie singing-dancing-drugging scenes are truly wonderful ,  and accurate in their tone  ( i'm old enough to remember )  ,  and i feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zoned-out kids are actual hippie extras ,  as i remember hearing about kids on the caravan to the east getting this kind of work in bollywood .    ( it is not about the actual hare krishna movement ,  though the movie hippies sing a krishna/rama chant ,  as do a group of actual indian devotees ,  unrelated to the hippies ,  in the opening scene of the movie .  )   ~virginia
we do not come across movies on brother-sister relationship in indian cinema ,  or any other language or medium .  this relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels .  typically ,  a sister is depicted as a pile-on who can be used for ransom in the climax .  this movie treats the subject in an entirely different light .   it is inspired by george eliot's novel  " the mill on the floss "  .  the brother is very prosaic ,  all-good ,  the blue-eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother .  the sister is romantic ,  wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society .  in spite of this ,  the love of the brother-sister is the winner .   this movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later .  it is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world .   although the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries ,  yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true . 
hare rama hare krishna was the biggest hit movie of 1971 .  filmed almost entirely in kathmandu ,  the capital of nepal ,  the movie depicts not only with the theme of a broken family ,  but also a relationship between a brother and a sister ,  as well as drugs and the hippie movement ,  which made many people think that it involved the iskon - the movement for krishna consciousness .   the movie begins with scenes of drugs and being informed that the woman dancing in front is the narrator's sister .  going back to the past the brother and sister are happily playing around the house only to hear their parents arguing .  this soon leads to a split in the family .  the brother goes with the mother and the sister with the father .   as years pass ,  the brother goes in search of his sister and is informed that she no longer lives with the father and that she has moved to nepal .  here ,  prashant ,  the brother not only finds love ,  but he also finds his sister ,  janice .  but he finds out that she is not only in the wrong company of friends but is also on drugs as she wants to block all memory of her past .  with help of shanti ,  his love ,  the brother tries to get his sister away from all this but has to overcome many obstacles ,  including people who stoop to all sorts of levels to stop him this is a multi cast movie and is led by the director and producer himself ,  dev anand and also stars zeenat aman  ( her first movie )  ,  mumtaz ,  rajendranath ,  prem chopra ,  jnr mehmood ,  a . k .  hangal and achala sachdev .  the music is superbly provided by the late r . d .  burman ,  whose last score was  " 1942 - a love story .  "  during the filming ,  dev anand asked panchamda  ( r . d .  burman )  to compose something special for this film .  days later panchamda came back with the composition of  " dum maro dum .  "  the song was an instant hit . 
 " the shooter "  was a different type of film for michael dudikoff .  although normally associated with action flicks that incorporate martial arts ,  this film  ,  because it was a western ,  enabled him to display that he is a far more capable actor than certain formula story lines have allowed .   the major problem ,  of course ,  is that the film does not allow any solid character development .  the fleshing in is really left to the viewer  .  we can only guess at the sadness that has made the shooter ,  whose real name is michael atherton ,  the killer that he is- a killer ,  mind you ,  that a little town ,  terrorized by a local bully ,  welcomes as a hero who can release it from its misery . 
star rating :  ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits   mike atherton  ( dudikoff )  is peacefully making his way in the wild west when he spots a group of men mistreating a lady .  being a gentleman ,  he naturally steps in and puts a stop to this and in doing so kills the son of a nasty enforcer .  this is just the beginning of a all guns blazing battle to the finish from which there will be only one winner .   m dudikoff is an action star who's never truly managed to take off with me .  maybe i discovered him too late and after the other film i saw with him in it last monday ,  the human shield ,  it was just another dud  ( ha ha )  added to the list .  but i have a thing for westerns ,  being films that just sort of transport me to a different time and place and provide real escapist entertainment and with this dudikoff has picked one of his better scripts ,  as his films go anyway .   the film hits a few low points in the shape of a naff central villain ,  sounding like a blank marlon brando and some generally ropey acting from some of the cast ,  along with the obligatory cheap looking sets .  but if ,  for some strange reason ,  your life ever depended on watching a dudikoff film ,  this would be one of your best choices .  ***
i feel this is one of the best movies i've seen , i'm an older male and love most westerns .  i love movies based in part at least on facts , if i am not mistaken this is such a movie .  i also like revenge type movies , this qualifies there as well in my opinion . some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene .  i felt the corral beating scene was a little overkill but did not affect how i feel about the complete movie .  i saw what i think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoke episode .  i also enjoyed that . i recommend taking the time to watch this movie  , i will watch it again .  i also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played .  i thought it was so out of character for randy travis to play a villain type  , but i always enjoy his acting . 
action ,  horror ,  sci-fi ,  exploitation director fred olen ray shows he has some talent as a director .  character actor william smith is one of the best tough/bad guys in the industry .  he treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career .  as for randy travis he gives his best lee van cleef impression .  he's not bad in the film .  smith and travis make the movie .  as for the rest of the cast none of them really stand out .  ray did a great job directing this flick ,  smith and travis were good ,  i'd give this b western on a scale of one to ten ( ten being the best )  a seven . 
yesterday ,  i went alone to the cinema ,  because here in mexico ,  most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called  " camára alternativa "   ( alternative camera )  .  but after i saw this movie ,  i realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative .  afortunately ,  this is a good a example .  but i have to said that i enjoyed so much this movie .  .  that at the end i was happy .  .  this movie is a little spoon of hope in these days .  and the main lesson for me .  .  is that at the end of the day .  .  . the love is main force behind us .  this is a good option to see a good movie in spanish .  .  . and i have to mention the good music .  .  specially the main song of the movie .  .  cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena .  .  .  .  excellent song !  !  ! 
gómez pereira is the responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of latest spanish cinema  ( just take a look at his curriculum vitae )  ,  so i didn't expect that much of  " cosas que hacen .  .  .  "  .  .  .  in fact i don't know why in the world did i decide to watch it .  anyway ,  i just did .  .  .  and what a surprise .  it looks that gómez pereira has finally matured and now he's capable of making a good movie .  he's last work deals with the midlife crisis ,  the disappointing ,  and the seeking for a second chance after you've ruined it all .  the last half hour of the movie  ( the more dramatic )  is the best part ,  and it just makes worth watching the film .  also we have eduard fernandez playing the main role ,  and i keep on thinking he's the best actor of his generation  ( by far )  .   *my rate :  7/10
in what appears an attempt to mix drama and comedy ,  manuel gomez pereira made this film ,  'things that make life worthwhile .   " it is not an original discovery ,  by many voice you have  ( quite off the pitch ,  by the way )  ,  but it departs somewhat from the norm in the spanish cinema .  the downside is that the elements forming the film are poorly combined ,  and while some points are not well developed ,  others are out of place .  a day in the lives of two people close to the median age .  it's basically what the movie gómez pereira .  jorge  ( eduard fernandez )  is a stationary  ( parado )  one which ,  despite load on your back with a drama major ,  seems willing to see things change .  only this explains his commitment to a minor could mean a turning point in its existence .  in line with audrey tautou of 'long dating'  ( jean-pierre jeunet ,  2004 )  ,  jorge says things like this to herself :   " if i find a coin before the corner that is now going to change my luck .   "  of course it finds it ,  begins to play 'today could be a great day'  ( hoy puede ser un gran dia ) by joan manuel serrat and in a few crosses on its way hortensia  ( ana belen )  . she is another woman entry age ,  divorced and a little lonely .  take valeriana for sleeping ,  organizes birthday parties as an exemplary mother ,  said her belief in god and leads to a speed of homicidal mother .  hortensia is a woman of many contradictions in his behavior ,  life was going in his head driving data as  " 70% of people fall in love only once in a lifetime "  and said although it is short of jorge and unemployed and does not preclude the possibility that it is a  " sadistic "  sleeping in his shoulder in the cinema at the earliest opportunity .  later came a communion ,  a dance in the luxurious wedding banquet ,  the back of a car and other things that players seem to live unique experiences like that but end up doing quite heavy for the viewer .  'things that make life worthwhile' debate between us is the drama of two adult persons who have no other that leads them to see where their strange relationship and ,  conversely ,  make us take the case as a comedy ,  focusing on things like a chinese singing at a wedding  ( which seem to be amusing in itself )  or the gait of a drunk person .  the problem is that it does not leave us time to connect with the players ,  therefore we can not identify with the dramatic ,  and not give us a solid base comic too ,  leaving everything except pure joke .  in the end ,  all mixed in a way that the viewer no longer know very well whether to laugh or mourn ,  and ends up not doing either .  and it is true that something is not seen a thousand times ,  is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner ,  but it is not sufficiently different or special as we want to do .  ana belén  ( which apparently far less than the 53 years that has in this film )  and eduard fernandez are two actors who are very enjoyable to see working ,  but this time it seems ready or comfortable enough in scenes that require him to break the calm that prevails in the film ,  so in moments like the  " accident "  with the children of the bar thing seems to be slipping from their hands .  perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do ,  but that is no excuse to lower our guard .  in any case ,  both interpreters are erected easily the highlight of the function .  'things that make life worthwhile' work only up to the modest level of entertainment .  any claim that is beyond that point has not been fulfilled ,  as a romantic comedy or dramatic as that ,  we presume ,  they wanted to do ,  can not afford to have little moments finished successful  ( beyond bad )  as that in which one of the characters talk and laugh ,  lost drunk ,  compared to a boy who remains in a coma in part because of him .  neither do much for people like rosario pardo ,  making the typical friend launched whose biggest contribution to the film is the phrase  " must be screwed over ,  "  and songs from the soundtrack ,  though significant ,  not just fit .  it is true that the film by manuel gomez pereira has its hits  ( some of the moments involving jose sacristan )  ,  but the whole is a anodyne story ,  a film with good intentions and a nice result when the better . 
what does the marquis de sade have to do with egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults ?  tobe hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film .   genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in alexandria ,  egypt .  genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker  ( and blatant lesbian )  who services daddy on the side .  daddy gets sent back to the site ,  where he uncovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it .  genie meets a descendant of the marquis de sade ,  and falls for a hunky egyptian  ( providing the film's hottest scenes )  .  eventually ,  genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going .  wrapped around this story is footage of the marquis de sade in prison ,  talking to a portrait of what looks like genie .   robert englund is terrific as both the marquis and his descendant .  his acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements ,  so he is allowed to shine here .  his best performance is still in  " killer tongue ,  "  if you have not seen that yet .   the rest of the cast ,  including young genie ,  are pretty and average .  the script ,  however ,  is problematic .  you will quickly learn that the marquis scenes are completely unnecessary ,  except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set .  the mermaid cult that eventually saves genie makes no sense whatsoever .  who the mermaid is is never explained ,  and its link to christianity  ( which is hyped throughout the film )  is nothing .  the film is very anti-christian ,  as the archaeologist is a bible spouting father ,  but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute .  there are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence ,  but hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say .  i know i have no idea .   so why am i recommending this film ?  it is weird .  there is an extended sex scene .  for the ladies ,  hunky egyptian rides a horse completely nude .  englund is marvelous .  do you like snakes ?  this film is full of them .  this is like roger corman with a bigger budget .  knowing hooper somehow came up with  " crocodile "  after this is rather sad .   " night terrors "  is not perfect ,  but definitely worth a winking ,  unserious look .   this is rated  ( r )  for physical violence ,  some sexual violence ,  gore ,  profanity ,  female nudity ,  male nudity ,  sexual content ,  sexual references ,  and drug abuse .   
stupid ,  stupid ,  stupid .  i think that angelina jolie is probably one of the most talented actress' today ,  but a movie like this isn't just worth her time .  she deserves better ,  and so does everyone else in this movie .  talent is just wasted .  sorry ,  but i don't feel like writing a review for this .   i give it no stars out of ***** . 
this truly funny movie has a zany cast of characters ,  just about every voluptuous middle-aged female in hollywood ,  and a touching ,  funny love story .  the capomezza's and the malacici's are rival caterers in an italian neighborhood in new york .  they are also at opposite--extreme--ends of the taste scale .  their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of romeo and juliet .  naturally ,  they fall in love .  on stage !  the mayhem and confusion that this causes ,  as the parents feud with each other and their kids ,  is played out for us against the backdrop of the capomezza's magnificently tasteless home ,  and their magnificently tasteless catered weddings .   besides the four over-the-top parents and the charming young lovers ,  the characters include a vaguely wise priest ,  a plain-speaking grandma ,  a lady who waves a wand and passes on spiritual advice she receives from a medium called the blessed roscoe ,  a motel with beds shaped like the back seat of a car ,  and two doves .  there is not a sight gag or a punch line that doesn't click in this fast paced movie .   even the family names of the two families are part of the fun .   " capomezza "  could be interpreted as  " low-brows ,  "  and  " malacici "  could mean  " stuck-up snobs .  "    if you are sensitive about italian stereotypes ,  you may not like this movie .  if bette midler embarrasses you ,  you may not like it ,  because all of the women in this movie make bette midler look like martha stewart .  the rest of us should love it ! 
perhaps in an attempt to find another  " hot property "  for adaptation ,  the brothers fleischer thought back to their highly successful foray into the world of the newspaper comic strip with their production of 1933's popeye the sailor  ( fleischer studios/paramount )  .  although it was a part of the betty boop series ,  miss b .  only made a brief appearance in the short ;  leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the possible emergence of a full blown series .   as is now common knowledge ,  the gruff ,  squinty eyed ,  brawlin' seaman became perhaps the most successful cartoon series ever ;  outlasting and literally outliving the fleischers and their studio ,  lasting to this day .   returning to king features for another try at luck was no doubt the reason for trying out the very popular henry comic strip character in a betty boop outing ;  objective being the seeking of another series .  the reasoning then surely seemed sound .  henry was a most popular feature in the hearst papers' line-up ;  appearing as both a daily and on sunday's color comics supplement ,  puck ,  the comics weekly .  you know ,   " what fools these mortals be !  "  remember that one ,  schultz ?  in viewing the chubby ,  little ,  bald boy comic strip 'hero' and his on screen antics ,  both solo and in tandem with miss betty ;  we were pleasantly surprised in seeing just how well the character was handled .  the story and director dave fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip-like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little henry .  these mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in remaining faithful to the printed page ;  as the henry feature was mostly done in a sort of 4 color 'mime' .   in the cartoon ,  titled betty boop with henry :  the funniest living american  ( fleischer studios/paramount pictures corporation ,  1935 )  ,  we see what is ;  basically being a one situational exercise ;  being punctuated with the usual array of dave fleischer's rapid fire ,  machine gun-like gags .  in short ,  henry spots a puppy in the window of betty boop's pet shop .  it is a sort of love at first sight as henry attempts to purchase the little pup dog with the only money he had ,  to coins in his pocket .  he is in formed by miss boop that it would be $2 . 00 in depression era money to make the purchase .  tears appear as the little guy leaves dejectedly .   but a reprieve is soon on the horizon as betty asks the boy to mind the store ,  while she leaves on urgent business .  in return for his services ,  miss betty promises him the little dog in return .  of course ,  they have a deal and betty leaves .   getting to the work of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock affords the opportunity for the fleischer crew to fire up a whole new string of gags ;  this time featuring bird seed ,  henry's bald pate and push brooms .   ( but not all at once of course ,  schultz !  )  henry's enthusiasm for mass feeding of the store's avian population by first literally seeding his head soon leads to a mass defection of the birds ;  out of the store to the open street in a mass jail break .   betty returns to this sight and expresses her disappointment and anger with henry's temporary custodial care .  all bets were off ,  no doggie for henry .  he begins to leave ;  dejectedly ;  but soon convinces the proprietress to give him another shot at fixing things up .  his head covered with bird seed ,  he manages to corral all of the little feathered creatures ;  returning them to their pet store coop .  happily ,  the little fella leaves ;  but this time he has his own affectionate ,  little ,  face licking puppy .   undoubetly this was a winning combination .  we have the carefree ,  energy filled ,  free wheeling of the boy ,  the kindness of betty and the emotions of the situation and doubtful outcome of the 'boy and his dog' situation .  max and dave fleischer had given us a sort of almost minor mini-masterpiece of a surreal comedy short .   we were quite surprised that no henry series followed .  judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character ,  it certainly could have been sustained for some time .  at any rate ,  this teaming was in many ways the best of the betty boop try out pictures .  although the first ,  popeye the sailor  ( fleischer/paramount ,  1933 )  ,  was the most successful  ( and barely had any betty boop in it ,  save for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer )  ;  the henry short was much better than the two following king features  " tryouts "  ,  betty boop and the little king and betty boop and little jimmy ,  both 1936 .   poodle schnitz !  ! 
first off ,  let me say i have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because i knew angelina jolie was in it and i love her .  but my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie .  anyhow ,  no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did .  i watched it and absolutely loved it .  yes there were italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny .  it was not degrading in any way .   every actor and actress did a superb job .  i laughed very hard at the sexual humor .  overall ,  i think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it .  it is adorable and just plain fun to watch .  i rarely rank movies as a 10 but i give this one a 10 !  !  !   go find it and watch it ! 
the movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too .  it was extremely funny .  angelena jolie was wonderful as juliet .  the parents are hilarious . they are caterers as well as enemies . the kids play the parts of romeo and juliet in the church play . they fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart .  ( spoiler ahead .  i think )  they sneak off after a party and do it .  surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie .  if you don't like stereotypes and the defilement of classic literature don't watch .  if you don't mind those you will have a blast watching this one . 
a delightfully unpretentious send up of romeo and juliet .  approach with no expectations other than having a good time and you will enjoy this one .  a talented group of comic actors let go and have a riot in this light-hearted performers' vehicle .  bad reviews were due to a snobbishness about treatments of shakespeare .  some people feel that all film must be  " important "  ---if you share those views ,  don't bother .  the credits read  " introducing "  angelina jolie ,  which is not even close to being true ,  but she is astoundingly beautiful as the juliet character ,  and ,  as always ,  her acting is wonderful--- and ,  considering her age at the time ,  even her dialect is pretty good .  recreating this classic tale with feuding italian families in the catering business in new york results in great fun .  see it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud . 
once again ,  i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4 . 88 .  fifty-percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap  ( i mean horrible beyond belief )  but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good .  this movie is much better than i expected .  i found it very engaging ,  though it was obviously made by an amateur .    the direction is nothing special ,  but the story is intriguing with some good thrills .  i expected it to be more of a comedy ,  but i wasn't too disappointed .    for a thriller ,  this movie is surprisingly good-natured .  there's no bloody violence ,  no profanity ,  no nudity ,  no sex .  usually ,  these movies require all four of those elements .  the pg rating is well-deserved--not like  " sixteen candles "  where the  " f "  word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene .    i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could've been developed more .  the film does tend to be plot-heavy ,  and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side .  instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them ,  we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors .  they end up kissing at the end ,  but there's so little chemistry that it seems forced .    " the dream machine "  is no gem ,  but it's good ,  clean entertainment .  it's quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns ,  except for haim--but it's also much better than you'd expect .    my score :  7  ( out of 10 ) 
there have been far too few mainstream films set in post-colonial africa ,  and the ones that have are a mixed bunch .  this one ,  with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s ,  shows the best and worst values of africa ,  which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole .  it also has shortcomings ,  given the undue influence of western pre-conceptions of africans and ,  especially ,  arabs .   dr anansa linderby ,  the beautiful african-american wife of the english doctor david linderby ,  is captured by arab slave-traders ,  along with a teenage sanufu girl and a young boy .  the lead slave-trader ,  suleiman ,  is every bit the stage arab ,  with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric ,  and gestures to match - which would not be out of place on  " carry on follow that camel "  but are not up the standard this film deserves .  peter ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script ,  and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful one-dimensional character .   continuing the stereotypical theme ,  all three of suleiman's arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy ,  which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen .   one of david's first ports of call is the local police officer ,  a stereotypical pompous and incompetent african bureaucrat .  david then meets two stereotypical white ex-pats ,  an englishman  ( walker ,  played by rex harrison )  and an american  ( sandell ,  played by william holden )  .  sandell is a mercenary with  " conventional "  views on mixed-race relationships ,  who initially refuses to help unless david provides payment up front .  won over by david's love for anansa ,  and conscious of his own inability to find love ,  he agrees to take david up in his helicopter to help search for anansa .  they find suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory - as a result of sandell's hesitation and david's lack of experience with firearms ,  his helicopter is shot down but david survives .   we then see david introduced to malik  ( kabir bedi )  ,  an african who has lost his family to suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance .  they find the sanufu girl with a group of tuareg and know they are on the right track to find suleiman .   in one of the most heart-rending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not suleiman's group ,  and have no choice but to send their captives to the tuaregs they met earlier .   later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and ,  in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones ,  he uses his knowledge to kill one of suleiman's henchmen .  anansa on her part - and despite the scepticism of the boy - manages to engineer the demise of suleiman's two other employees .   by this time suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market .   suleiman ,  now in no doubt that anansa is  " trouble "  ,  attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy arab prince  ( omar sharif )  who is corrupt but intelligent .  on discovering that anansa is an american working for the u . n .  ,  the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences .  the scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the film .   at the slave market ,  the young boy is sold to a middle-aged german paedophile ,  and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered  " wunderbar "  when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch-doctoring skills .   david and malik finally confront suleiman and there is a bitter-sweet ending from malik's point of view .   ultimately ,  david and anansa are re-united ,  and malik ,  whose life is in ruins ,  can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completed .   the overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters .  credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting . 
ashanti is a very 70s sort of film  ( 1979 ,  to be precise )  .  it reminded me of the wild geese in a way  ( richard burton ,  richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa )  .  it's a very good film too ,  and i enjoyed it a lot .   david  ( michael caine )  is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa  ( beverley johnson )  who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor .  while they're doctoring ,  one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman  ( played perfectly by peter ustinov ,  of all people )  .  the rest of the film is david trying to get her back .   michael caine is a brilliant actor ,  of course ,  and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back ,  but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff .  he's helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on  ( rex harrison !  )  ,  then briefly by a helicopter pilot  ( william holden )  ,  and then by an arab called malik  ( kabir bedi )  .  malik has a score to settle with suleiman  ( he is very intense throughout ,  a very engaging character )  ,  and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back - this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camel .   then there's lots of adventure .  there's also lots of morality-questioning .  the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point ,  and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster ,  but it's all pretty forgivable .  the question is ,  will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif  ( yes ,  of course omar sharif is in it !  )  ? 
this movie is visually stunning .  who cares if she can act or not .  each scene is a work of art composed and captured by john derek .  the locations ,  set designs ,  and costumes function perfectly to convey what is found in a love story comprised of beauty ,  youth and wealth .  in some ways i would like to see this movie as a tribute to john and bo derek's story .  and .  .  . this commentary would not be complete without mentioning anthony quinn's role as father ,  mentor ,  lover ,  and his portrayal of a man ,  of men ,  lost to a bygone era when men were men .  there are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in a confidence that contributes to a sense of confidence ,  containment ,  and security .  yes ,  they do not make men like that anymore !  but ,  then how often do you find women who are made like bo derek . 
bo derek's beauty and john derek's revolutionary direction make this film worthwhile .    bo ,  looking more gorgeous than ever ,  is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing visitations from her 'dead' husband  ( anthony quinn )  .  he has a plan .  bo must procure the body of a young man so that her ghost of a husband can make his transformation from spectre back to corporeal life .  can she find a fitting candidate ?  how will she do him in so tony can do his thing ?    with bo's attributes ,  john's unique direction ,  quinn's film presence ,  and ,  thanks to john ,  a very pretty exotic look to the entire film ,  this movie is pleasant viewing . 
i'd read about flavia the heretic for many years ,  but i only got to see it early last year ,  when i went on an insane movie-buying binge ,  and ,  for whatever reason ,  it has been on my mind lately ,  though it's been some months since i watched it .   it's a striking film ,  set in italy somewhere around the 15th century .  definitely medieval-era  ( though i don't think any specific year is ever given )  .  this being the time of christian ascendancy ,  the age is a time of utter madness ,  and the movie captures this very well .   flavia ,  our protagonist ,  is a young lady who encounters a fallen muslim on a battlefield .  he seems a warm and intriguing fellow ,  and she's immediately taken with him .  her father ,  a soldier of a a family of some standing ,  comes along ,  almost immediately ,  and murders the wounded man right before her eyes .  but she'll continue to see him in her dreams .   her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open-air insane asylum--the residents ,  so harshly repressed by unyielding medieval christianity ,  slowly go mad .  flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns .  but in a mad world ,  only the sane are truly mad ,  and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her .  her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with flavia ,  who ,  being young and apparently sheltered ,  is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped .   the movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world ,  showcasing a lot of unpleasantness .  we see a horse gelded ,  a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig-sty ,  the pious torture of a young nun .  through it all ,  flavia observes and questions ,  rejecting ,  eventually ,  the christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic .  i disagree with that criticism .  flavia's views ,  though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror ,  for example ,  then-contemporary feminist commentary  ( the movie was made in 1974 )  ,  revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions .  it is ,  perhaps ,  difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time ,  but that's the sort of minor point it doesn't do to belabor .  flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era ,  or of any era ,  to empathize with her plight .  getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees .   flavia is heartened when the muslims arrive ,  invading the countryside ,  and she finds ,  in their leader ,  a new version of the handsome islamist who still visits her dreams .  smitten with her almost immediately ,  he allows her to virtually lead his army ,  becoming a joan of arc figure in full battle-gear ,  and directing the invaders to pull down christian society ,  and wreak vengeance upon all those she's seen commit evil .   is she the herald of a new and better world ?  she may think so ,  but muslims of that era weren't big on feminism ,  either ,  as she soon learns the hard way .  as they say ,  meet the new boss .  .  .   this is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in flavia the heretic .  the movie is quite grim ,  and with a very downbeat ,  rather depressing ending .  not a mass-audience movie at all ,  to be sure .  it's quite good ,  though ,  and doesn't belong on the  " nunsploitation "  pile on which it is often carelessly thrown .  i think there's much value in the final film ,  and i'm glad i saw it . 
post-feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism .   spoiler alert !    this underrated gem of a film tells the story of flavia ,  a fifteenth century girl of noble birth walled up in a convent after defining her father and indeed the whole of medieval christian society by viewing a fallen islamic warrior as a human rather than demonic figure .   unable to accept the patriarchal rule of the convent  ( explicitly stated in a scene where the bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks )  flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds herself and ,  through butting up against a whole system of subjugation ,  repression and violence ,  inevitably brings a tragic end not only to herself but all those around her .   billed as a piece of nunsploitation this is far from the truth .  this is a film depiction the consequences of violence ,  the effects of patriarchal dominance ,  the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit .   i described it in the title of this piece as 'post-feminist' and in the end flavia's triumphs must always be corrupted ,  compromised and perverted by men .  even flavia's gruesome end is perpetrated by men for men  ( the women turn away and only the monks look on without horror .   as to the much discussed violence :  this is a depiction of the effects of violence and the horrors of a world driven mad by religious excess .  to have shied away from the violence would have limited the film's impact ,  would have cheapened the film and allowed it to be assimilated within the patriarchal discourse it is exposing .  in addition it is a realistic portrait of medieval society .   beautifully filmed ,  brilliantly acted  ( notably by florinda bolkin and maria casares )  ,  containing a wonderful score by piovani and still challenging after all these years flavia is a classic of european cinema . 
expecting to see another nunsploitation movie with a mean mother superior abusing and torturing her charges ,  flavia turned out to be much more than i had anticipated .   it actually has a feminist storyline ,  though i don't think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set .  it certainly wasn't practiced .  women  ( and the jews and the poor )  are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society .  throughout the story ,  sister flavia  ( florinda bolkan )  witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just can't sit there any longer and actually does something about it ,  albeit with disastrous results .   the pre-credit sequence has flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield .  she sees an injured  " evil "  muslim soldier  ( one of the few still alive )  and tries to assist him .  before she can ,  her hate-filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face  ( great family dynamics ,  huh ?  )  .  after this ,  her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice .  though scenes do involve violence ,  rape and nuns ,  i would consider this more of a historical drama than nunsploitation .    indeed ,  many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there ,  but the acting ,  camera-work ,  storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level .  most  " nun "  films i've seen usually have the basic premise of :  a good girl somehow winds up in a convent ,  where the mother superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and/or make their lives a living hell .   flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her .  much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong-spirited  ( but slightly loony- she likes to pee outside like me ,  but it's a lot easier for guys )  sister agatha .  when a group of muslims attack their abbey ,  flavia and agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns .  their attackers actually function as their liberators  ( of the cruelty and near-slavery of the abbey )  .  in fact ,  it is a christian ,  not a muslim invader ,  that impales dear sister agatha .    it is agatha's death that sends flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her .  .  .  her father treats her like dirt .  her muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time .  i don't want to give out too much of the rest of the story ,  but be prepared to be shocked ,  devastated and saddened at the conclusion .  this is a great film ,  so don't be put off by its  ( undeserved )  reputation as a trash epic .  plus ,  how on earth could a movie featuring florinda bolkan and claudio cassinelli go wrong ?  i am not familiar with maría casares' other works ,  but sister agatha is a hell of a character .   i have read many great reviews of the synapse  ( us )  release ,  but i love my german x-rated kult dvd copy .  it isn't anamorphic/16 : 9 ,  but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than synapse's release .   and there are also many great ,  wise or funny lines of dialogue  ( many from sister agatha )    " why is god male ?  the father ,  the son ,  and the holy spirit they're all male !  "  -flavia   " these men are afraid- look at them ,  sister- afraid their power will be taken away from them !  "  -sr .  agatha  ( regarding christians fleeing after the muslims arrive )    " woman ,  where are you going ?  the moslems can do nothing to you that the christians haven't done !  ha ha ha !  "  -sr .  agatha  ( to a group of fleeing christian women )    " lord bless these moslems- for putting fear into these pompous christians .  "  -flavia   " does it take the mere sight of a moslem to make you $h ! t your underclothing ?  "  -sr .  agatha  closing message :   " flavia gaetani ,  not yet a muslim - no longer a christian - was punished as a runaway nun .  the idea for the film came from events which occurred during the musalman invasions of italy culminating in what even today is remembered as the martyrdom of the 800 at otranto " 
at least for a half hour a week .  i haven't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks  ( abc/cbs/nbc )  in years .  all of the lions are interesting ,  although larry can get annoying at times .  i really like the middle earth action figures they bring in with hunter .  most of the other characters are interesting as well .  the sideshow of siegfried and roy is entertaining at times ,  too .  the animation is top notch ,  and definitely the best cg that has been done on a weekly tv show .  usually when they hire big names to star in a show ,  they're trying to hide a poor script or characters .  not entirely true in this show though ,  there's a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting ,  but overall the characters stand on their own .   this is definitely for 16 and up .  there's nothing here that most kids haven't already heard before though ,  and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads .  it's definitely not as crude and edgy as south park ,  but does bring some of the same  " bash everyone "  feel to it .  one example is that it makes fun of both dick cheney and barbara streisand at the same time in one episode .    father of the pride and other dreamworks productions like shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of animaniacs ,  pinky and the brain ,  and freakazoid .  it's the same type of humor grown up .  it may not be as witty as spielberg's classic tv series ,  but it's still good .   i hope that it finishes this season off well ,  and is renewed for future seasons .  otherwise i may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again .

" flavia the heretic "  of 1974 is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of italian exploitation cinema that ,  to a certain extent ,  follows a somewhat feminist premise  ( though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of feminists )  .  set mostly in a convent ,  and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist  ( great performance by the wonderful florinda bolkan )  ,   " flavia the heretic "  may be referred to as a 'nunsploitation' film .  however ,  this film differs quite drastically from the typical nunsploitation flicks from the time ,  as it doesn't so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism ,  sadistic lesbian punishments ,  etc .  personally ,  i saw more similarities to the hexploitation flicks of the time ,  such as  " mark of the devil "  ,   ( even though this one doesn't treat the topic of witch-hunts )  ,  which focus on the brutal execution of christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern period .   italy around 1600 :  after witnessing her despotic father behead a wounded muslim soldier ,  young flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent .  when her father condemns a fellow nun to a torturous death for a small misdemeanor years later ,  falvia's disgust with male violence against women turns into hatred against the despotic church ,  and she joins a band of arabic scavengers .  .  .   one thing is for sure ,   " flavia the heretic "  is not for the faint-hearted ,  and neither is it for those who want happy endings .  director gianfranco mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible ,  especially in its nasty scenes .  the many torture- and execution-scenes are extremely disturbing ,  with skinnings ,  spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail ,  the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film .  the violence here is never superfluous ,  however .  after all ,  this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in .  the film is very well-made ,  with realistic costumes ,  fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by nicola piovani .  the stunningly beautiful and great florinda bolkan has proved her talent in many great italian cult-productions  ( including lucio fulci's giallo-masterpiece  " non si sevizia un paperino "  of 1972 )  .  she delivers another great ,  charismatic performance here ,  and i couldn't imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does .  the film has some minor inconsistencies  ( e . g .  why does the rigid church let bizarre cult-followers into convents in the first place )  .  however ,  it is overall amazing how realistic this film is .   " flavia the heretic "  should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of italian exploitation cinema .  this is a great exploitation flick overall ,  though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood .  highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema .  7 . 5/10
there is so much that can be said about this film .  it is not your typical nunsploitation .  of course ,  there is nudity and sex with nuns ,  but that is almost incidental to the story .   it is set in 15th century italy ,  at the time of the martyrdom of 800 christians at otranto .  the battle between the muslims and the christians takes up a good part of the film .  it was interesting when everyone was running from the muslim hoards ,  that the mother superior would ask ,   " why do you fear the muslims ,  ;  they will not do anything that the christians have done to you ?  "  certainly ,  there was enough torture on both sides .   sister flavia  ( florinda bolkan )  is sent to a convent for defying her father .  in the process ,  she witnesses and endures many things :  the gelding of a stallion ,  the rape of a local woman by a new duke ,  the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the tarantula sect ,  and a whipping herself when she ran off with a jew .  the torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun ,  and her nipples cut off .   sister flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives .  she even asks jesus ,  why the father ,  son and holy ghost are all men .   eventually ,  she joins the leader of the muslims as his lover and they sack the convent .  here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time .  but ,  tragedy is to come .  she manages to exact sweet revenge on all ,  including the duke and her father ,  but finds that the muslim lover treats her exactly the same .  she is a woman and that is all there is to it .   i won't describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end ,  but it predates the torture of saw or hostel by decades .   nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats ,  but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest . 
flavia the heretic is a strange entry in the nunsploit genre - equal parts sleaze ,  feministic journey ,  and  " history "  as we follow flavia on her strange trip .   we start off with flavia in a convent .  .  . she ain't too happy there cuz she doesn't believe in all the male-dominated  " rules "  and macho-ism of the world around her and escapes from the convent with her jewish pal ,  abraham .  they are both eventually caught and flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another  " non-believing "  nun in hastening a moslem invasion .  flavia hangs out with the moslems who take over the convent and get  " busy "  with the nuns in a strange set of scenes .  eventually the moslems roll-out and flavia is punished as a traitor to christianity in another singularly brutal scene .  .  .   this one has pretty much all the stuff that i like to see in a 70's era exploit film - some good gore ,  including nipple-removal ,  and a nice leg-skinning scene ,  some decent nudity - including the requisite full-frontal ,  and a decent storyline as well .  i will say that it sorta dragged in a few points ,  but not enough to get truly bored with it .  i would definitely recommend this one to nunsploit/70's exploit fans .  .  . 8/10
too many sources routinely lump this thought-provoking period drama in part based on historical fact together with the superficially similar  " nunsploitation "  which was a mainstay in '70s euro trash cinema ,  overlooking the righteous anger that drives the whole endeavor .  perhaps coincidentally it was also director gianfranco mingozzi's singular attempt at narrative film-making outside of many well-received documentaries .   safely set within a historical context ,  flavia charts the growing rebellion of an early 15th century italian nun  ( florinda bolkan's career performance ,  even surpassing her sterling work in lucio fulci's devastating don't torture a duckling )  ,  locked away in convent by her not so nobleman father in a desperate attempt to curb the girl's budding sensuous nature .  wondering why women are relegated to secondary roles at best in life as in holy scripture ,  she is confronted by ways in which male domination can rupture female lives ,  inspiring revolt fueled by the ranting of semi-crazed older sister agatha  ( indelibly portrayed by veteran actress maria casarès from marcel carné's les enfants du paradis )  and - more constructively - by a muslim invasion .  joining the oppressors and perhaps unwittingly manipulating them to do her bidding ,  flavia truly becomes the outcast she already felt herself to be ,  with expected tragic results .   with its breathtaking widescreen compositions by alfio contini ,  who shot michelangelo antonioni's zabriskie point ,  this is an uncompromising and austere account of one woman's fierce yet ultimately futile fight against patriarchal society which allotted her no rights beyond childbearing or whoring as sister agatha wryly remarks .  a lengthy drug-induced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on ken russell's otherwise far more flamboyant devils notwithstanding ,  the movie turns out relatively stingy in the skin department ,  making something of a mockery out of its semi-porn reputation .  this is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation . 
flavia ( florinda bolkan of  " don't torture a duckling "  fame ) is locked away in a convent of carnal desires by her father . tired of all of the sadism she sees around her ( rape of a young woman in a pigsty , sexual cravings , horse castration ) flavia decides to run from the convent with her jewish friend from the outside , abraham . the two don't get very far before they are captured and then brought back to be tortured and forced to repent . after punishment she joins up with a band of muslims called the tarantulas , who had invaded the convent prior and leads a crusade that turns into nothing short of a bloody battle behind the convent walls .  " flavia the heretic "  is a well-directed and fairly notorious piece of italian nunsploitation . the film is slightly gruesome and sleazy at times . the acting is great and the characters are well-developed . overall ,  " flavia the heretic "  is a genuinely moving and intelligent movie with plenty of nudity and gore . you can't go wrong with it . 8 out of 10 . 
reportedy based on actual historical events ,  this disturbingly violent ,  bloody ,  and shocking period epic sustains viewer interest by creating a verisimilitude missing in the majority of films set in a remote era .  ms .  bolkan's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force .  her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences :  her witnessing of the hated local duke's casual rapist activity ,  her forbidden love affair with a jew ,  her criminal defection to the invading moslem forces of the sensual prince ahmed  ( anthony corlan )  there are some painfully realistic gory sequences  ( human flaying )  in this film that are not for the squeamish ,  but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest .  deserves to be seen ,  if only as an antidote to hollywood depictions of the medieval world . 
flavia the heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euro-exploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored .  this is an intelligent and complex film ,  beautifully realized and  surprise  pretty damn accurate !  this is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it's about time those prudish film committees who categorize flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well .  flavia is a beautiful 14th century adolescent ,  forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent .  she refuses to accept her being inferior just because she's female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this .  after a fruitless attempt to escape ,  she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty muslims into the walls of the convent .   flavia is a downright mesmerizing film !  almost impossible to believe that director gianfranco mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing .  i challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneer-feminism more intensely than flavia does .  several sequences are quite shocking  ( on the verge of nightmarish ,  actually )  as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes ,  torture and mutilation .  yet all this raw footage isn't just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds ,  mind you .  i'm strongly convinced that they're part of the statement 'flavia' is trying to communicate :  humanity  ( the catholic church in particular )  historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there's no use in denying it any further .  films like  " flavia ,  the heretic "  have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and i truly admire them for it .  flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance ,  but it's even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography ,  the glorious costumes & scenery and a breathtaking musical score by nicola piovani .  florinda bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but it's maría casares who steals the show as sister agatha .  she's a man-hating and loud-mouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field !  amen ,  sister ! 
let's think people  ,  quit bad-mouthing the original  ,  for it's time the original battlestar series was a masterpiece  ,  even still with all the stars  ,  story lines and art  .  lorne greene was great as adama and richard hatch was perfect as apollo and dirk benedict was funny as starbuck  ,  but i dare say  ,  not as pretty as katee as starbuck  .    i loved the episode with the pegasus and greetings from earth was good john calicos was great as baltar  ,  war of the gods  ,  the best was experiment in terra  ,  i thought that was a tribute in a way to heaven can wait  ,  then you had the women of battlestar  ,  not to compare them to let's say tricia who is outstandingly beautiful as number six  ,  but jane seymour's beauty could not be compared to  .  let alone loerrta spang as cassiopea was fantastic  . she had beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed by  .  i loved the original as much as the new  .   can you imagine if john calicos had a number six  ?   :  )   thankyou for listening  . 
this movie is pretty good .  half a year ago ,  i bought it on dvd .  but first i thought that it was the original film .  i have seen the series and it is a good film ,  but here ,  they have put  " the living legend , part1 and 2 "  , and  " fire in space "  together .  the same as they did with the first film ,  but with other episodes .  but still ,  it is a pretty good film .  only the ending is strange  ( you don't see what happens with the pegasus )  .  but i still think that it is pretty good .  the actors and special effects were good .  if you haven't seen it ,  go see it .  starring : richard hatch ,  dirk benedict ,  lorne greene ,  herb .  jefferson jr .  ,  tony swartz ,  terry carter ,  lloyd bridges ,  jack stauffer . 
although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows :   " fire in space "  and  " living legend "  ,  if you watch the original shows you'll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out .  i found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it .  i would say if you want to see the show in its original version ,  see the video versions on vhs .  they have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on dvd now .  another good video is conquest for the earth ,  which had more scenes from galactica 1980 than did the actual broadcasts themselves .  overall ,  i rate this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers . 
as i said in my comment about the first part :  these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess .   the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization ,  but the aftermath ,  thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans ,  protected by only one powerful spaceship .   but when battlestar pegasus appears ,  the story heats up ,  carrying the battle back to the cylon planets .  okay ,  it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth ,  but it works for me .  it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects  ( even though those tend to repeat themselves ,  to say the least  : - )   )  .   i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board .  instead ,  we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen .  .  .   so thumbs down for the productions of 1980 ,  but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978 . 
i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available .  i had high expectations ,  and was not disappointed .  it's funny ,  and the animation is excellent .  that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films ,  so i'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it .  maybe the dvd release had improved animation ?  one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot .  i'm an adult ,  and i really appreciate that it is for adults .  it isn't only kids who like cute animated characters .  it is nowhere near  " raunchy "  as some have claimed ,  but i can see where some parents wouldn't want their young children to see it .  i'm very disappointed that it was cancelled .  i wish they would produce more episodes .  or perhaps a movie . 
found this flick in a videostore ,  it cost $2 to buy .  the whole movie stinks really bad !  the so-called colonel ,  who would the hero here if the cover could have been trusted ,  must be in his eighties and is barely able to walk .  he nevertheless manages to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world .  then the story leaves the colonel ,  which makes sense given the old man's inability to do anything worth mentioning ,  a now two terrifyingly eighties-looking guys take over ,  in what must have been some sort of story .  i got lost a hundred times but didn't mind ,  because the movie is so bad ,  it's real fun to watch .  zero-budget trash with actors not deserving that name .  go check it out ! 
hey people ,  what's up .  it's me man ,  the one and only mike  " sonny sakura killer "  kelly .  you know .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  you can't really write a review on the script of sakura ,  cause there we didn't have one .  as far as i know ,  the story was just made up as we went along .  i had the best time of my life making that film ,  and got so much stank that i ran out of jism .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . fun times .  so glad that you all enjoyed the film .  i really didn't get to do the fights that i had envisioned .  every time i set up some moves ,  the fight director kept changing them .  still ,  i had a blast and met some really great people .  especially the purple female ninja who has seem to fall of the film-making scene . 
it's hard to rate films like this ,  because do you rate it on production or just fun ?   i saw this film back in about 1988/89 or so when i was a boy and i'm sorry to say it started a life long fascination with ninjas .  the plot is fairly dire and the acting is of course terrible ,  but there is a certain mystique surrounding the ninjas in this film which makes for quite a good atmosphere .  what is important are the fight scenes ,  while a 'little' sparce ,  are really good .   i must say it was better when i was a boy ,  only now can i see the glaring points of unbelievable nonsense in the film ,  but as a  " sit back with a few beers "  martial arts film i can't fault it ,  it delivers and is much better than the mountains of  " american ninja "  style rubbish that was churned out in the 80's with hundreds of guys in black suits but really not very good fight scenes .   in an interesting note ,  dusty nelson ,  the writer and director of sakura killers did another ninja film under the bonaire movie flag called  " white phantom "  i have no idea if this was meant to be a sequel to sakura killers "  but the sakura clan is once again a main feature ,  including the same logo and similar story only this time including a white ninja .  this too ,  while being mostly dire ,  had a small sense of atmosphere but the fight scenes are even more sparce and to be frank ,  are pretty awful .   so ,  if you are a martial arts fan then give it a blast to kill a few hours ! 
don't listen to the many acerbic and derisory comments heaped upon this film .  .  .  .  . simply put ,  as regards ninja movies ,  this my friends is about as good as it gets !    yes it's silly ,  yes the acting and script are admittedly absolutely atrocious ,  but by gum - it's so much bloody fun !  in fact ,  as is often the case with b-movies ,  the horrendous 'acting'  ( which in the case of the movie in question ,  is truly amongst the worst i have ever had the joy to behold !  )  and ridiculous 'plot' actually only serve to elevate the enjoyment level ten fold .   obviously the fight scenes are the main attraction in this though and for the most part i'm pleased to say ,  they're very well choreographed ,  especially the final showdown  ( during which we witness that ninja are not ostensibly constrained by the normal laws of gravity .  .  .  .  )    trust me on this ,  if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not yet seen sakura killers ,  then you are truly missing out on what is in my opinion ,  one of the true jewels in the crown of the genre . 
if you only read a synopsis of the plot ,  this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the 1930's .  the story would seem quite contrived ,  the subject matter maudlin .  the strength and beauty of this film is in the direct ,  earthy performances of the cast . i have seldom seen jean harlow display such a range of feeling ,  rich and subtle nuances float over her face .  if you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel ,  there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters .  the raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed ,  so true .  the final sequence is almost unbearably poignant :  when clark gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son ,  lifts him up and proudly says ,   " my kid !  "  ,  i couldn't help remember that mr .  gable's own son was born to him posthumously .  this is one of the finest examples of depression era cinema . 
jean harlow and clark gable were a great on screen team and this may be their best movie together .   yes ,  hold your man can be cheesy and predictable ,  but that's not what i love about the movie .  i love seeing harlow and gable together and in this film they are simply wonderful .  it is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that is part of what makes this such a wonderful film .   the witty dialogue ,  great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this such a good movie .  i loved this movie the first time i saw it and on each subsequent viewing i always notice at least one new detail .  to me ,  that is a mark of a great film .   the dialogue and script are better than most movies from this time period  ( early 30's )  .  i adore classic movies ,  but i admit that most of them are just average and at times don't hold my interest .  hold your man is one of the exceptions .   this has a lot to do with the fact that hold your man is a 'pre-code' movie .   ( the hays code was not enforced until a year after hold your man .  )  this movie could not have been made under the code .  well ,  it could have been made ,  but it would have been an entirely different story .  thank goodness the code was not enforced until 1934 .  otherwise ,  we would have missed out on this gem . 
one of the great mysteries of life ,  suffered from daily ,  is why nice girls so often are more interested in the jerks and heels than in the nice guys .   worse ,  when the nice guys even want to marry those girls ,  the girls still prefer the jerks and heels ,  even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt ,  have shown they're just interested in using the girls .   stu erwin is the nice guy ,  who continues to be nice after being lied to and cheated and even after losing the girl completely .   clark gable is the jerk ,  and he is perfect in the role ,  rather a sad note to his fans .   jean harlow comes across as a more slender mae west ,  even sounding like la west in some of her cynical throwaway lines .   somewhat puzzling is that so many of the other characters ,  intended to be bad guys -- i mean ,  heck ,  they're locked up ,  so they must be -- are so obviously nice people .   in fact ,  there are lots of nice people here ,  people who ,  in a lesser film or story ,  would be snarling and back-stabbing but here go out of their way to help someone else .   so ,  maybe the story is rather clichéd ,  at least by modern standards ,  but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watched .   the biggest complaint i have is that so many really good actors are not given credit .  once again ,  we can say a fervent  " thank you "  to imdb . com . 
i expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930's romance .  boy meets girl ,  they fall in love ,  boy loses girl ,  boy wins her back in the end .  it wasn't like that at all .  clark gable plays con artist eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising .  he is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into ruby  ( jean harlow ) 's apartment ,  to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub ,  no less .  instant chemistry . she plays hard to get for a while ,  but a girl can only resist that grin for so long .  the heat between them is evident ,  and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code !  when a blackmail job goes bad and ruby ends up in a boarding house for  " troubled girls "  ,  she is miserable and ,  thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her ,  begins to believe that eddie will never come for her .  harlow plays the hard-nosed ,  fast talking ruby perfectly .  she never lets gable get all the good lines !  there is an especially moving scene with her playing  " their song "  on the piano that is acted perfectly .  the last fifteen minutes have me crying every time .  a truly sweet romance . 
father of the pride is a pleasant surprise :  it is funny ,  witty and features some great voice acting .  the show is about the family of a lion who is acting as the attraction of siegfried & roy shows .  indeed all of them are stereotypes but that's what makes them so funny .  fotp is not a kiddie-cartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way .  it is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed .  i'd say i'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original ,  i've seen most of those stereotypes many times before ,  even in that particular order ! 
hold your man finds jean harlow ,  working class girl from brooklyn falling for con man clark gable and getting in all kinds of trouble .  the film starts out as his film ,  but by the time it's over the emphasis definitely switches to her character .   the film opens with gable pulling a street con game with partner ,  garry owen and the mark yelling for the cops .  as he's being chased gable ducks into harlow's apartment and being he's such a charming fellow ,  she shields him .   before long she's involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets .  gable ,  harlow ,  and owen try pulling a badger game on a drunken paul hurst ,  but then gable won't go through with it .  of course when hurst realizes it was a con ,  he's still sore and gets belligerent and gable has to punch him out .  but then he winds up dead outside harlow's apartment and that platinum blond hair makes her easy to identify .  she goes up on an accomplice to manslaughter .   the rest of the film is her's and her adjustment to prison life .  her interaction with the other female prisoners give her some very good scenes .  i think some of the material was later used for the mgm classic caged .   harlow also gets to do the title song and it's done as torch style ballad ,  very popular back in those days .  she talk/sings it in the manner of sophie tucker and quite well .    gable is well cast as the con man who develops a conscience ,  a part he'd play often ,  most notably in my favorite gable film ,  honky tonk .   still it's harlow who gets to shine in this film .  i think it's one of the best she did at mgm ,  her fans should not miss it . 
this movie is witty ,  watchable and utterly touching .  and now often do you get to see jean harlow  ( or any actress of this era ,  for that matter )  give another woman a swift punch in the jaw ?   ( twice !  )   after harlow's ruby is sent to a reformatory after getting mixed up with gable's edward hall  ( he of that cheesy yet endearing crooked smile )  ,  her predicament becomes all the more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant ,  and she's convinced that this rake has abandoned her ,  but in fact ,  her love has reformed him and he comes to see her ,  despite the fact that he will be arrested ,  and from the help of a minister ,  are married .   the wonderful relationship that harlow shares with her fellow inmates is second only to her electric chemistry with gable ,  who was her most frequent leading man .  her cynical character is a perfect match for gable's smooth-talking crook .  what's not to like ?    " you know ,  you wouldn't be a bad looking dame - if it wasn't for your face !  "  ruby cuttingly remarks to gypsy ,  her rival .   " if you're going to get that close to me ,  i'll have to open the other window !  "   priceless !  !  ! 
clark gable plays a con man who busts into the life of hard-boiled dame jean harlow .  he tries to sucker her while she brushes him off with her tough-gal attitude .  despite their cynicism and cons they fall in love .  when gable accidentally kills a man during a sting he runs out leaving loyal harlow to women's prison where she discovers she's pregnant .  anita loos' and howard emmett rogers' writing is excellent throughout with many well-drawn and surprising characters  ( including a jewish socialist woman inmate and a black woman inmate and her preacher father played with hardly a trace of stereotype )  .  gable and harlow show their mettle as actors adding telling nuances and quirks to their characters that send them beyond the typical gable and harlow roles .  and the direction is much better than you'd expect from sam wood .  one beautiful shot has harlow being inducted into the prison ,  then led out into a surprisingly snowy courtyard as the camera tracks after her .  this is one of the best of both the  " criminals in love "  and  " women's prison "  genres and has some of the best hard-boiled dialogue ever written . 
one word :  supurrrrb !  i don't think i have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television .  watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring re-runs .    i have to say i had my reservations .  after all ,  critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show .  but when half an hour was over  ( by the way ,  thank you ,  nbc ,  for running a commercial-free show )  ,  i was left with the feeling of instant love ,  love at first glance ,  the true love that one feels in his guts .  everything about this show screamed excellence .   graphics in this show were at least as good as finding nemo and shrek .  no small feat considering those movies took years to be developed .   cast was marvelous .  i am partial to john goodman's voice ,  but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john .  special mention :  lisa kudrow's guest appearance .  she was on top of the game creating neurotic ,  pudgy ,  and lovable panda with a jewish streak in her .   ( panda from brooklyn ?  only in this show .  )    script was funny ,  with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp ,  yet not tacky .  a note for all parents :  this is not for children .  this show was never advertised as such ,  and there's a reason why it's set for 9pm ,  not 8pm .  so if you'd like to complain about  " objectionable context "  ,  save your breath .  adults deserve a comedy made just for them ,  and father of the pride is it .    not everything was perfect .  i was a bit puzzled by siegfried and roy's characters .  do i sense  " stereotype "  when it comes to them ?  yes ,  they are gay .  yes ,  they are flamboyant .  yes ,  they speak with german accents .  but that's yesterday's news .  give us something new ,  something fresh ,  something funny .  putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach .  i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the  " star power "  that these guys have .  that's fine by me .  but please don't dwell on something everybody already knows by heart .  hopefully ,  the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over .    in general ,  the show is definitely a must-see-tv .  funny ,  witty ,  with a few unexpected twists here and there -- there haven't been a comedy this good since seinfeld .  i am certainly looking forward to the next episode . 
what can i say ?  ,  ms erika eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever ,  and like a italian american ,  fan number one of female beauty i can't forget this movie .   you know i really don't remember a lot about the plot ,  or the situations or the other actors  .  i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous erika and that in this film she looks better than ever ,  i really don't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie ,  i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in brooklyn just contemplating erika's beauty .   well just to conclude if you are an erika eleniak's beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you . 
i have seen this film on countless occasions ,  and thoroughly enjoyed it each time .  this is mostly due to the lovely erika eleniak- a great actress with incredible looks .  plus ,  any film starring tom berenger and dennis hopper is bound to be entertaining . 
well ,  the movie isn't exactly  " funny .  "   okay ,  i admit ,  there are a few humorous lines ,  but definitely nothing that is laugh-out-loud funny .  for example :  right before a steamy sex scene between eleniak and one of her male costars ,  sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt .  before leaving the room to retrieve the key ,  he tells her ,   " okay ,  don't go anywhere .  "   see ,  humorous ,  but not funny .   the plot and acting are pretty good .   but erika eleniak definitely steals the show .  she's hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can't help but rewind and re-watch .   there are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines .   overall ,  5 stars .  i'd only give it three if not for erika eleniak . 
no movie with dennis hopper ,  gary busey ,  erika eleniak ,  tom berenger ,  dean stockwell ,  marilu henner deserves a rating under 5 on here .  this is a poor mans version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless midnight run except the prisoner being transported here is the very easy on the eye ms . eleniak .  tom berenger plays another gruff ,  maverick military type well and william mcnamara plays his rookie-about to be discharged foil well .  the plot on the face of it is absurd because i lost count of the times eleniak should have and could have escaped but this is an entertaining feel-good movie and there are good cameos from all of the above actors that keep the movie rolling .  this isn't really a family movie as there is some swearing and a rare nude scene with eleniak but this is a lot better than some of the other guff that came out around this time . 
if you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor ,  then you will enjoy this flick .   i don't understand why anyone wouldn't enjoy this one .  take it for what it is :  a vehicle for dennis hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh .  it ain't shakespeare ,  but it is well done .  ericka eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one - better than any episode of baywatch - and shows a knack for subtle humor .  too bad she hasn't had many opportunities to expand on that .   tom berenger fits his role of  " real navy "  perfectly and william mcnamara does a solid job as a hustler .   throw in a walk-on by hopper in the middle of the chase for  " the cherry on this sundae "  and you've got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing .  i bought this one as soon as it was available .   brain-candy . 
my wife and i have watched this movie twice .  both of us used to be in the military .  besides being funny as hell ,  it offers a very realistic view of life in the navy from the perspective of a navy enlisted man ,  and tells it  " like it really is "  .  we're adding this movie to our permanent collection  ! 
is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story ?  maybe ,  hell ,  you know how the formula works by now ,  pretty woman is introduced in to a picture ,  someone has to fall in love with her .   i think this film does follow some typical story lines ,  but that doesn't say anything about the content .  there are great scenes with crispen glover ,  dennis hopper ,  and gary busey ,  although short .  some things didn't make sense ,  such as the need to get in to random fights ,  but it is entertaining to watch ,  the fights were actually well done .   this is definitely a comedy foremost ,  but it does have a lot of good feel to it .  the humor is well balanced ,  you won't hurt your stomach on this ,  but you will keep a smile .   there is a little bit of steamy action ,  so not one for the kids . 
i felt this movie was as much about human sexuality as anything else ,  whether intentionally or not .  we are also shown how absurd and paradoxical it is for women not to be allowed to such a nationally important event ,  meanwhile forgetting the pasts of our respective  " advanced "  nations .  i write from japan ,  where women merely got the right to vote 60 years ago ,  and female technical engineers are a recent phenomenon .  pubs in england were once all-male ,  the business world was totally off-limits for women in america until rather recently ,  and women in china had their feet bound so they couldn't develop feet strong enough to escape their husbands .  iran is conveniently going through this stage in our time ,  and we get a good look at how ridiculous we have all looked at one time or another .  back to the issue of sexuality ,  we are made to wonder what it may be intrinsically about women that make them unfit for a soccer game  ( the official reason is that the men are bad )  .  especially such boyish girls ,  a couple so much so that you even get the feeling that lesbianism is on the agenda as well .  i think one point is that not all women are the same ,  and the women the police are trying to  " protect "  are not the ones who would try to get in in the first place .  the opening scenes of the approach to the stadium makes you appreciate the valor of the young women trying to get in -- and each one separately -- at all .  it is a brutish man's world .  any woman brave enough to try to go should be allowed !  the world of sexuality is not one-size-fits-all .   meanwhile ,  the apprehended criminal girls bond inside the makeshift pen awaiting their deportation to who-knows-where ,  and in a much more subtle way ,  begin to bond with the guards keeping watch over them .  these had definite ideas about women and femininity ,  which were being challenged head-on .  the change in attitude is glacial ,  but visible .   since the movie is pure iran from the first moment ,  it takes a little easing-into for the foreigner ,  but the characters have a special way of endearing themselves to you ,  and you end up getting the whole picture ,  and even understanding the men's misunderstandings and give them slack .  the supposed villain is the unseen patriarchy of the ayatollahs ,  which remain unseen and unnamed ,  and likely unremembered .   knowing that this movie was filmed during the actual event of the iran-bahrain match gives me a feeling of awe for all involved . 
it was simple and yet so nice .  i think the whole sense of sex segregation in society ,  which can be bitter ,  was shown very delicately .  it had a bitter kind of hummer in it .  the fact that most of the actors were not professionals ,  made the movie more tangible and more realistic .  there was a  " documentary "  side to the movie too .  the best scenes were those that all the girls ,  banned from watching ,  were listening passionately to the soldier ,  who is supposed to keep an eye on them ,  broadcasting the game .  if you are an iranian ,  the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won ,  fills you up with national pride !  !  if you are not iranian ,  you'll still love it all the same ! 
there are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious ,  political and societal means .  not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights ,  as well as wage inequality ,  and marginalization in society ,  all in the name of allah or god or some other ridiculous justification ,  but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach and shed some light on the subject .   the setting is the 2006 match between iran and bahrain to qualify for the world cup .  passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the match .   the women who were caught  ( played by sima mobarak-shahi ,  shayesteh irani ,  ayda sadeqi ,  golnaz farmani ,  and mahnaz zabihi )  and detained for prosecution provided a funny and illuminating glimpse into the customs of this country and ,  most likely ,  all muslim countries .  their interaction with the iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them ,  both city and villagers ,  and the father who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such unwritten rules .   it is mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it has to save it's women from the crude behavior of it's men .  rather than educating the male population ,  they deny privilege and rights to the women .   seeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of iranian society ,  it is nos surprise this film will not get any play in iran .  but jafar panahi has a winner on his hands for those able to see it . 
which do you think the average person would know more/less about :  iranian cinema or iranian football ?  interestingly ,  the two come to the forefront of controversial iranian filmmaker jafar panahi's latest film entitled 'offside' ,  a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one's right to do something or go somewhere and an individual's right to extend that courtesy if and when they'd like to .  the odd thing is ,  you don't come away from offside having learnt about iranian football or too much about iranian cinema  ( unless it's an education in panahi's controversial style )  ,  but you do come away feeling enlightened ,  that at least someone from iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like iran ,  and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it .   i can remember the 2006 world cup ,  i'm sure many people can .  it was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year ,  a summer of world cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic .  needless to say ,  i saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in spain '82 when it was thought west germany and austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of algeria .   anyone in britain that was watching the bbc's broadcast of the iran  mexico game ,  both nations' first of the tournament ,  may remember that at the top of the show ,  the bbc's football anchorman gary lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match .  it went something like :  'we've seen giants germany ,  england ,  argentina and holland play but now we get to see .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . mexico and iran battle it out' .  the emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore .  it's a shame because there are people ,  and films like offside present them ,  who are really willing to see iran play to the point where they risk their well-being to achieve it and it's sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem 'inferior' when there are others who'd do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage .   when immediately thinking of the words 'iran' ,  'football' and 'world cup' ,  my mind flies back to the france '98 game between said nation and america .  here is a film about a world cup game of sorts involving iran but where some or indeed most iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around iran's famous victory over the united states and what that meant to them ,  director panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude .  you can imagine a heavy handed film detailing iran's 'victory' as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they 'defeat' a western power or 'enemy' at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in .   a couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are 2001 indian film 'lagaan' ,  in which the indian peasants defeat the ruling british at cricket .  similalry ,  2005's 'the game of their lives' sees the americans defeat the english at a football match only this time in the 1950 world cup .  the differences between these films and offside are immense ;  offside is looking at a situation behind a state's mentality and dares to explore an essence of feminism as the girls ,  trying to see their beloved iran defeat bahrain and qualify for the world cup ,  are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game .  the reasoning is to do with the foul language the men 'may' ,  not will ,  but 'may' use during the game .  the film presents iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man's right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman's right to see the game all together  it is no wonder panahi's film was itself banned in iran .   but panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones ,  two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body/mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match .  panahi pays special attention to the title of his film 'offside' which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an 'attacker' is 'caught' trying to gain an advantage in the field of play .  the parallels run with the womens' position in the film as these advancing  ( supposedly without right )  individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team ;  that being the state itself .   i think offside is one of the better films to come out of the middle east and surrounding gulf area that i've seen .  it's a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the imdb and thus ,  the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo-realist aura to it all .  the immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong-doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful .  i also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons i've mentioned shows a distinct level of callous ,  either that or you work in the iranian government . 
offside is the story of teenage-girls who tried to sneak in the stadium to watch final world cup qualifying soccer match in tehran that may lead iran to the 2006 world cup in germany .  females are forbidden to go to stadium by law in iran ,  although many of them dress like boys and sneak in .  stadium guards search every one at the entrance to make sure no one carries fireworks and of course ;  no girl gets in .   like most of panahi's work ,  his armature cast's performance was superb .  you actually think that you are watching a documentary .  the dialogs between the girls and the privates were executed delicately and astonishingly believable .  the film depicts the interactions between captives and the drafted guards who themselves are serving mandartory away from their family and friends in a funny sort of way .  at the end ,  the audience realizes that there is not such a difference between the girls and the guards who were just following orders . 
this is a totally delightful and unexpected film .  you start by following a young person who hopes to get into the qualifying football game between bahrain and iran .  if iran win they will get into the 2006 world cup in germany .  the problem is the young person is a girl and girls  ( or women for that matter )  are not allowed into football matches to  " sit with men "  .  what follows is a wonderful comedy ,  played with consummate skill by a small ensemble cast .  the film explores the absurdity of restrictions on the freedom of women  ( and for that matter the young soldiers who have to corral them )  .  there are some excellent set pieces ,  not least when one of the girls must go to the toilet and ,  of course ,  the stadium has no toilets for women .  the camera work is of the simplest and in some ways this story could have been told as a stage play .  yet it is the small scale that gives the film its bite .  great cinema ?  no ,  probably not ;  great entertainment - for sure . 
in iran ,  women are not permitted to attend men's sporting events ,  apparently to  " protect "  them from all the cursing and foul language they might hear emanating from the male fans  ( so since men can't restrain or behave themselves ,  women are forced to suffer .  go figure .  )  .   " offside "  tells the tale of a half dozen or so young women who ,  dressed like men ,  attempt to sneak into the high-stakes match between iran and bahrain that ,  in 2005 ,  qualified iran to go to the world cup  ( the movie was actually filmed in large part during that game )  .    " offside "  is a slice-of-life comedy that will remind you of all those great humanistic films  (  " the shop on main street ,  "   " loves of a blonde ,  "   " closely watched trains "  etc .  )  that flowed out of communist czechoslovakia as part of the  " prague miracle "  in the mid 1960's .  as with many of those works ,   " offside "  is more concerned with observing life than with devising any kind of elaborately contrived fictional narrative .  indeed ,  it is the simplicity of the setup and the naturalism of the style that make the movie so effective .   once their ruse is discovered ,  the girls are corralled into a small pen right outside the stadium where they can hear the raucous cheering emanating from the game inside .  stuck where they are ,  all they can do is plead with the security guards to let them go in ,  guards who are basically bumbling ,  good-natured lads who are compelled to do their duty as a part of their compulsory military service .  even most of the men going into the stadium don't seem particularly perturbed at the thought of these women being allowed in .  still the prohibition persists .  yet ,  how can one not be impressed by the very real courage and spunk displayed by these women as they go up against a system that continues to enforce such a ridiculously regressive and archaic restriction ?  and ,  yet ,  the purpose of these women is not to rally behind a cause or to make a  " point .  "  they are simply obsessed fans with a burning desire to watch a soccer game and ,  like all the men in the country ,  cheer on their team .   it's hard to tell just how much of the dialogue is scripted and how much of it is extemporaneous ,  but ,  in either case ,  the actors ,  with their marvelously expressive faces ,  do a magnificent job making each moment seem utterly real and convincing .  mohammad kheir-abadi and shayesteh irani are notable standouts in a uniformly excellent cast .  the structure of the film is also very loose and freeform ,  as writer/director jafar panahi and co-writer shadmehr rastin focus for a few brief moments on one or two of the characters ,  then move smoothly and effortlessly onto others .  with this documentary-type approach ,  we come to feel as if we are witnessing an actual event unfolding in  " real time .  "  very often ,  it's quite easy for us to forget we're actually watching a movie .   it was a very smart move on the part of the filmmakers to include so much good-natured humor in the film  ( it's what the czech filmmakers did as well )  ,  the better to point up the utter absurdity of the situation and broaden the appeal of the film for audiences both domestic and foreign .   " offside "  is obviously a cry for justice ,  but it is one that is made all the more effective by its refusal to make of its story a heavy-breathing tragedy .  instead ,  it realizes that nothing breaks down social barriers quite as efficiently as humor and an appeal to the audience's common humanity .  and isn't that what true art is supposed to be all about ?  in its own quiet ,  understated way ,   " offside "  is one of the great ,  under-appreciated gems of 2007 . 
different film directors from different countries have contributed to the film medium a lot by their thoughts .  as a result ,  we have experienced different genres when the medium is concerned .  jafar panahi ,  unlike j . l .  godard or f .  truffault ,  believes in simple story telling ;  schematic narratives is one of the main traits of his directorial job .  he has trust upon the automatic as well as critical intelligence of the viewer ;  he does not feel any necessity to go for alienation or such things to reach to the viewers .  he is equally effective despite being conventional .  offside  ( 2006 )  ,  is another schematic creation from him ,  where gender subordination of middle-east asia gets gradually clear to everybody as the simple but catchy tale of the movie progresses .  now-a-days ,  when all of us are shouting on the issue of rights of women ,  this movie very calmly creeps into our mind and ultimately becomes a hump for our critical intelligence by conveying the message that the egality of human rights is nothing but an illusive good ,  an utopia .  paternity will never let the women to be empowered .  an important soccer match where the nation is participating ,  a teenage girl who understands the game well ,  loves her nation does not have the rights to enter into the stadium to cheer for her country .  she is merely permitted to listen to the live commentary .  her alias could not work for her .  as a result ,  she had to undergo several humiliating situations .  from the very beginning her worried father ran here and there for her daughter .  at the end of the day ,  celebration came as the nation won the match which the girl could not see as she was detained in the outer side of the stadium during the match time .  but the celebration cannot suppress the question of rights of women which remain in every corner of the world in different format .  jafar panahi has most successfully pointed to this issue of gender abuse from with in the frame of conventional film making and patriarchy as well .  a global tragedy has been dealt with ease and some times with humour which ,  in turn ,  teases our being constantly . 
ah ,  the best and funniest movie about female football fans ,  only slightly better than the 1982 saga of teenage delusion set in north london  ( qv )  .  by the way ,  i just watched this on film 4 [2008-12-21] and am ruing my inability to set the pvr )  .   this is easily my second favourite football movie after  " mike bassett :  england manager "  ,  but this time with the added twist of looking like a guerrilla piece of movie-making from a team who apparently keep making movies which are banned in the country in which they are made  ( just think about the bit where the girls are taken from the stadium just as the sun is setting :  fast reactions all round )  .    it is rare for a movie to make me laugh out loud ,  but when the rural soldier escorted one of the girls into the lavvies while forcing her to wear an inpromptu mask made from a poster of ali daei ,  i couldn't stop waking the others in the house with my snorts ,  especially when the young soldier misunderstood the grandfather's calls for assistance .  .  .    speaking of the toilets ,  i just wish i could speak farsi so that i could work out the writing on the toilet walls  ( yes ,  there were a few scribblings in roman script ,  but they mostly referred to wanky american rock bands )  .   also ,  on the rural-and-farsi theme ,  don't you reckon that omid djalili sounds like a yokel when he talks farsi ?  listen to the custody sergeant in this movie and then go  " yup .  "   i'm not going to bore on about the sexual politics of iran ,  and i'm not going to bore on about the dubious acting ;  my love for this movie comes from the script and the editing :  top notch stuff .   here's a list of my top favourite football movies :  1 .  mike bassett ,  england manager 2 .  offside 3 .  those glory glory days 4 .  a shot at glory 5 .  the arsenal stadium mystery
not a bad film .  somehow i was made to actually root for the iranians to win the game played in the movie even though i don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan .  the ending on the bus was exhilarating .   the film itself deals with the issue of women in iran ,  and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear .  despite this law ,  some women try to sneak in ,  but many of them get caught and detained .  it's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender .  in an interview ,  panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices ,  and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how iran once lived .  one hopes that future will come sooner rather than later . 
i don't know why some people criticise that show so much .   it is a great ,  funny show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time ,  but still .  .  .   the family dynamics are funny ,  and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows .  the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious .  the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried & roy jibes are only just above average ,  but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing .   this show was well worth the 8 pounds i paid for it .   rating :  8/10
on the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match wouldn't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this isn't about football it is about discrimination and the women's enthusiasm for the sport they love .   the film opens on the day of a crucial world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain ,  a girl is trying to get in to tehran's azadi stadium by dressing like a boy ,  it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her .  once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught ,  here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who's leader would rather be back home tending his livestock .  we never learn the character's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary .   as well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the  " disguise "  one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer .  the girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in germany .  the soldiers aren't shown as fundamentalists ,  they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman can't watch men's sports don't seem that convinced by their own arguments .   it is a shame that this film can't be seen in iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary iranians aren't a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere .  the cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures . 
i probably doubled my knowledge of iran when i saw secret ballot  ( 2001 )  .  now i know about four times as much  ( i doubt i learned a whole heck of a lot from not without my daughter  ( 1991 )  )  .   offside is a splendid budget iranian comedy about a group a girls  ( working individually )  to attend a decisive soccer match for their country's place in the world cup .  women are not allowed to attend soccer matches ,  so the nation's armed forces have been mobilized to save any women who try to enter from themselves .  some  ( teen ?  )  girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys ,  but are caught .  the movie is mostly set at this holding pen where the girls are detained by soldiers ,  awaiting some unspecified punishment  ( although ,  the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one insignia away from being executed !  )   the movie explores the absurdity of the situation .  the thinking that bars women from football matches comes down to it being too raunchy an experience for the fairer sexa philosophy not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago .  this farce comes to a head when a girl needs to go to the bathroom ,  so a soldier escorting her demands that she cover her eyes so she can't see the graffiti .  the conflict is not entirely about the battle of the sexes :  at one point some friction arises between a solider who is rural and the girls who are urban .   fortunately ,  this movie was not too culturally esoteric that the comedy was lost on this neighbour and cultural cousin of the great satan .  you have to be in the mood for it ,  but no one should avoid this movie because they think that they won't get it . 
i have to point out ,  before you read this review ,  that in no way ,  is this a statement against iranian people  .  .  .  if you really want to read something into it ,  than hopefully you see ,  that i'm against politicians in general  .  .  .  but if you're looking to be offended  .  .  .  i can't help you !   not in iran as this movie is banned there  ( see imdb trivia for this movie )  .  which is a shame ,  because the movie is great .  would it not be for  " grbavica "  ,  this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlin .   rightfully so  ( it was the runner-up ,  or second place if you will )  .  why ?  because it is a movie about oppression .  it's not even that this is a complete women issue .  it is about the government trying to keep the people down .  an analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie .  but by banning it nothing is resolved and/or can they make this movie disappear !    another reviewer had a great summary line :   " comedy about a tragedy "  ,  that sums it up pretty well ! 
 " father of the pride  "  was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life  .  and that is pretty sad  , specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air  (  think in  " the simple life  "  )  i admit that are many similarities with this show and  " the simpsons "   , but despite the similarities  , the show have it own merits  .  the animation is just adequate  , not incredible  , but is good  . the best are the characters  .  all the animals are very likable and funny  ,  and even sigfried and roy had their moments  .  the music was good  , i liked many of the songs  .   even if the show isn't very original  , i think that this had lots of potential  . like  " mission hill  "  a show that isn't very famous but i liked a lot  ,  this didn't have the appreciation that it deserved  .  what a shame  . 
that's what one of the girls said at the end .   is the soccer game a metaphor for a qualifying game between the girls  ( or more broadly ,  a free-thinking group )  and the authority ?   " to germany "  means to a future that's of hope ?    it's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience i've ever had -- despite the crude cinematography and plot ,  and mild over-acting  ( though i like the cast -- they're lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs )  .  the ridiculous situation is well captured .  i can feel the deep frustration being denied to a game  ( being female and a soccer fan )  and i cannot stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise .  i wonder why there's no women's section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided -- defeating the flawed reasons for the deny .   the movie is very cleverly made -- the amazing title ,  the filming during the actual game ,  the spontaneity ,  and various methods to put the viewers into the shoes of the characters -- the game that's so important but inaccessible  ( not shown )  ,  the luring light and cheering sound from the stadium ,  the confinement of the van ,  and the uselessness of it when those inside connect with the celebrating crowds outside .  i can feel the comfort coming from the radio ,  the drinks and the food ,  and of course ,  the kindness and consideration from each character to others .  during the end credits ,  i am amused that no character has a name -- he's just any  " soldier "  and she's just any  " girl "  or  " sister "  . 
this was the first of panahi's films that i have seen ,  i saw it at melbourne film festival .  i was totally absorbed by the different characters that he creates and how differently they react and behave compared to aussie kids and yet on other levels how similarly .  i think perhaps if more people could see movies like this ,  they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by the fear of the unknown .  there are the obvious large political differences between oz culture and iranian culture ,  but i found the more subtle differences between the characters ,  that this film fleshes out so successfully on screen ,  extremely fascinating .  there are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem to me ,  so unique .  i found it made the characters compelling viewing . 
in iran ,  the islamic revolution has shaped all parts of life ,  including everyday things .  but people still go on living their lives ,  generally just doing the things you'd expect ,  like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it's in the running to qualify for the world cup .  except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game .   a frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium .  the absurdity of the situation ,  the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team  ( nothing subversive there )  ,  and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a fine comment on humanity versus the ideology .   amateurish acting ,  good script and dialogue ,  a really enjoyable film .  bend it like beckham ,  sort of - a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people . 
another fantastic film from a country ,  where due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes ,  has no problems in creating passionate subject matter .  panahi takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing ,  non-professional cast .  while still getting across his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country ,  he does so without the need of a heavy storyline .  it is a positive take on a country ,  in particular its people ,  that the iranian population desperately need .  the greatest pity is it won't be released domestically .  the insular ,  paranoid iranian government assert that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them .  after growing up amid revolution and watching the academics ,  artists and educated 'disappear' over the last 25 years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there .  the realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup qualifier really transports you to the event .  the fact he shot it on 35mm is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format .  it looks fantastic .  his insistence in only using non-professional actors also really works in this film .  fine performances all round .  after watching many films showing the problems iran has and also the news media reporting the facts we can tend to demonise the people as well as the government .  this film does the opposite .  it shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe a change for the better isn't too far away .  some call panahi a feminist film maker but i think he just fights for the most oppressed demographic in iran .  young ,  independent women . 
panahi ,  whose previous films such as the circle and crimson gold have seemed to range from dour to grim ,  has produced in his new offside a funny ,  obstreperous ,  joyously chaotic ensemble piece that ends on a note of liberation and heartfelt fun  yet the movie deals with material quite as challenging and relevant as anything else he's done .  by focusing on a group of ardent girl soccer fans caught sneaking into the pre-world cup bahrain-iran match in tehran stadium ,  panahi brings up issues of national spirit and independent-mindedness ,  and the contradictions  and sheer absurdity  of the regime's religious gender apartheid in a world of modern competition with a majority youth population and urban girls who increasingly think for themselves .   as the film opens we breathlessly join one of the girls in a bus ,  with a father pursing a lost daughter .  this one has a disguise and has national colors as warpaint ,  but we cringe with her in the knowledge of what's going to happen :  she's still easily spotted .  the thing is ,  most of the men around don't really care .  still ,  rules are rules ,  and once they try to make it through the various checkpoints on the way into the big stadium the would-be soccer girls ,  or some of them anyway ,  get rounded up and held in a little compound upstairs in the stadium by some mostly young ,  green ,  and rustic soldier-cops who have no idea how to deal with these big city girls' independent ideas and would rather be watching the game  whose roar we constantly hear in the background  themselves .  each girl is different  represents a different set of reasons for wanting to break the rules and different ways of doing it .  one wore a soldier's uniform and got into the officers' section .  one is tough and masculine and mocking and provocative  ( she could pass for a pretty boy ,  and teasingly hints at that :   " are you a girl or a boy ?  "   " which would you like me to be ?  "  )  .  one doesn't care very much about soccer but went to honor a dead comrade .  one  ( aida sadeghi )  is an ardent soccer player herself  and so on .  these tehrani girls are stubborn and smart and they walk all over the uptight rural lieutenant in charge of them  ( safar samandar )  .  one of the rural cops  ( mohamad kheirabadi )  takes the girl soccer player to the men's restroom  ( of course there's no ladies' )  ,  forcing her to wear a poster of an italian football star as a mask .  a comedy of errors and chaos follows in which the girl escapes .   later a spiffy looking van comes with an officer who directs the cops to take the girls to the vice department  violating sexual segregation rules qualifies as vice .  a male gets mixed in with them  a kid who's chronically guilty of smuggling fireworks into the games .  the van turns out not to be so spiffy :  the radio aerial is broken .  but one cop holds it in place so they can listen to the increasingly heart-stopping reportage .  cops and prisoners are all joined in a common excitement now .  there's no score ,  the game goes to penalty kicks ,  and the winner will go to germany .   in the background through all this is a real game ,  a real stadium ,  and real masses of young men crazy about the outcome of this event .  the excitement is tremendous ,  and the streets are jammed with cars and flags and a milling mob of supporters praying for an iranian win and united in their excitement .   what makes this film so good ,  as may be clear by now ,  is that it's shot during the evening of an actual game with a real finale that turns everything around .  this ,  in contrast to panahi's previous highly calculated narrative trajectories ,  is spontaneous vérité film-making that improvises in rhythm with a captured background of actual events and sweeps you into its excitement in ways that are quite thrilling .   the essence of offside is the disconnect between modern world soccer madness and retro-islamic social prohibitions repressing women  the latter existing at a time when young iranian women are becoming part of a global world in which females participate in sport and share in the ardor of national team spirit .  how exactly do you reconcile the country's ambition to become a modern global power with social attitudes that are medieval ?  a lot of offisde is astonishingly real ,  including the way everybody tries to talk their way out of everything .  the director's decision to inject young actors into an actual sports mega-event leads to a stunningly effective blend of documentary ,  polemic ,  and fiction that is too energetic to seem to have a bone to pick ,  and that ends in a way that's brilliant and moving .   i've had reservations about panahi's films before ,  but this one kicks ass .  panahi does something remarkable here .  he critiques his society ,  presents an unusual drama ,  and touches our hearts with a sense of a nation's aspirations . 
the us state dept .  would not like us to see this movie ,  because they have a beef with the iranian govt .  however ,  it shows us just how civilized iran really is ,  despite the content of the film ,  which centers on the struggle of women there for equal rights in the simplest of terms :  the ability to watch a soccer game at the stadium ,  which is strictly limited to male audiences alone .  the film is hilariously funny ,  and in and of itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in iran .  i enjoyed this movie intensely .  five girls try to penetrate the police border at the ticket gates to a soccer match between iran and bahrain .  the ensuing comedy is too funny to describe ,  from the bus trip to the stadium ,  to the interceding of the police and subsequent detention of the girls ,  to the resulting end .  don't miss this classic film .  its a must see .  one of the best foreign films i've seen in years . 
 " cinema is dead ,  long live the cinema !  "  said peter greenaway ,  one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors ,  at the last year's romanian film festival anonimul ,  which got to the third edition and takes place in the danube delta .  this year the direction prize went to jafar panahi's  " offside "  .  i got to see it this evening in bucharest at the festival's retrospective .  cinema is dead but still very lively .  panahi's film tells in a compelling manner how iranian society looks .  digitally filmed ,   " offside "  is a story inspired by a real-life event happened to panahi's daughter :  the trouble and risk took when decided to attend a football match .  this is forbidden in iran as we are informed .  what panahi manages to do is to render with few means ,  but with ,  probably ,  a lot of work ,  intelligence and humor the cultural patterns in a society that places women at a distinct level .  the absurdity of the laws becomes comical .  the film has a happy end ,  after all because iran's team goes to the world cup .  what i appreciated most was the concept ,  the idea behind this film .  i would be very interested to see panahi's other films that were forbidden in iran as well .  i guess that he can be thought as an activist director . 
in the white balloon and crimson gold ,  the two other films by jafar panahi that i've seen ,  the director mines surprising amounts of depth in subjects that seem ,  on the surface ,  slight .  in offside ,  panahi's seriocomic tribute to iranian women standing up for their rights ,  i don't think he's as successful .  not that what he's saying isn't important ,  of course  ( and it's too bad that ,  like pretty much every other panahi film ,  iranians can't see it )  .  but ,  after a while ,  the film feels a tad flat ,  and it feels long even at 90 minutes .  not saying i didn't like it ,  though .  the actors are all fantastic ,  and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious .  but it's not an important work ,  in my opinion . 
jafar panahi's comedy-drama  " offside "  portrays some women trying to enter a tehran sports arena from which women are banned .  the official reason :  lots of foul language ,  and the soccer players have their legs showing .  but of course ,  it's really a case of sexism .  so ,  most of the movie consists of mild comic relief as the women try to ask the men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium ,  and one woman even comes up with her own scheme to defy the men .   as i understand ,  all of jafar panahi's movies  ( this one included )  are banned in iran .  the real tragedy is that the cia's 1953 overthrow of the prime minister and subsequent backing of the brutal shah gave ayatollah khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the koran to establish a chauvinistic society ,  and that george w .  bush's current policy towards iran gives mahmoud ahmadinejad an excuse to act the cowboy and tighten censorship .   above all ,  this is a neat look at people coming up with ways to challenge the system .  not a great movie ,  but worth seeing .  considering that all jafar panahi's movies are banned ,  i wonder how he's able to even make them . 
in iran ,  women are officially banned from men's sporting events .  in june 2005 ,  the iran's national soccer team has an important game against bahrain in the azadi stadium for the qualification of the world cup .  a group of iranian girls and lovers of soccer dresses like boys and unsuccessfully attempts to enter in the stadium being arrested .   soccer  ( and flamengo's team )  ,  beach and movies are my greatest passions ;  therefore i loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for soccer .  the director jafar panahi ,  from  " the white balloon "  ,   " the mirror "  and  " the circle "  ,  shot this movie on the day that iran defeated bahrain and qualified to the world cup in germany .  the dramatic and funny adventure of these iranian girls is one of the most delightful movies i have ever seen .  my vote is nine .   title  ( brazil )  :  not available
i had watched as much of the series as i could manage to watch on television ,  but unfortunately ,  started a job that got me working evenings .  i managed to catch some recordings of it ,  at least .  .  .  and ,  of course ,  purchased the recently released dvd of the complete series .  watching the dvd ,  you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first ,  but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done .  the voices are well suited to the characters ,  and the writing is excellent .  it's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it's roots by reintroducing adult themes .  thing is ,  with the way society has come in the last century ,  you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today's standards in order to be recognised as an adult-oriented show .  the characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life .  it's your typical sitcom in that regard ,  but the humor is more like what you'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live .  .  .  back when snl was actually funny .  good job ,  dreamworks .  perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going .  .  .  and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it's high costs .  it's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though .  hmm .  .  . 
i don't know how and where do the iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this .  in fact ,  it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way jafar panahi did .   the film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time ,  one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium .   it makes you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters ,  and while watching the movie ,  as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match .  you will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie .  it's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending ,  you will want to find out the verdict ,  you'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls .   i like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee .  it's like venus vs mars ,  it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like iran .   this is the second movie of jafar panahi that i have seen  ( the first being crimson gold )  and am looking forward to watching some more .   am already hooked with iranian movies and this one is a must-see ! 
in iran ,  women are not admitted to soccer games .  officially it's because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience .  but of course it is about sexism .  women are lower forms of human beings .   some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks .  they are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage ,  until the police will come and pick them up .   despite the insane situation ,  this is a film with lots of humor .  it's also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression .  you'll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs .  good job by director jafar panahi .  this is in many ways a heroic comedy . 
in iran women are prohibited from attending live sporting events because of the fear that they will be  " corrupted "  by bad language ,  close proximity to thousands of men ,  and the fact that there are no toilet facilities for women in the antiquated stadiums .  based on an actual incident involving the daughter of the director ,  jafar panahi's offside follows six girls ,  disguised as men ,  who are refused entry into the soccer match in 2005 between iran and bahrain ,  a match that will decide whether or not iran goes to the world cup .  in a departure from the bleak ,  minimalist films we have been accustomed to from iran over the last ten years ,  offside is an exuberant comedy that has a patriotic fervor and a universal appeal but contains enough subversive social commentary to warrant its prohibition from screenings in iran .   shot with a digital camera using non-professional actors who are more than up to the task ,  the girls try to sneak into azadi stadium in tehran but are arrested and placed in a holding area outside of the stadium .  they are guarded by three young army conscripts  ( safdar samandar ,  mohammed kheir-abadi ,  and masoud kheymeh-kaboud )  who express ambivalence about their task but are pledged to follow the rules .  the women are soccer enthusiasts ,  not political activists and cheer for iran's victory but this does not deter the soldiers from detaining them while they wait for the girls to be transported to the vice squad and an uncertain future .   outspoken rather than acting like victims ,  they continually question the soldiers about the rationale behind the restrictions ,  making their absurdity quite obvious .  although they can hear the crowd noise ,  the women cannot see the action but achieve a minor victory when they persuade one of the soldiers to provide a running commentary on the game .  one of the funniest sequences takes place when a female  " prisoner "  is escorted to the men's room by a soldier .  the young recruit then must cope with a near riot when he has to prevent anyone else from using the facilities while the girl is still inside .   little by little ,  to paraphrase adlai stevenson ,  that which unites them turns out to be greater than that which divides them and the unlikely antagonists rally behind their country and root for the victory that will send iran to the world cup .  although the point is made early and often and the film sags a bit in the middle ,  offside makes a telling point about a society where a political elite with a medieval social mentality has to contend with an growing group of educated and politically astute citizens .  one can only hope that world pressure and the awakening of its own people will force the ayatollahs to come to terms with the 21st century . 
this film is being described as a comedy ,  but it wasn't a comedy at all .  like any panahi film ,  it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy .  but it was very funny ;  much lighter than the director's dark and serious the circle  ( my favourite iranian film )  .  the resourcefulness of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was both completely believable  ( as if it were a documentary )  and completely hilarious .   the filming the actual match and aftermath was astonishing .  it added a realism much like australia's kenny ,  of course a very different film .   the performances from all the non-professional actors  soldiers and girls  were very credible .  it was very moving to see the passion ,  disappointment and excitement of these girls .  anyone in this country who thinks muslim girls wearing a chador are any different to their own daughters should go see this film  it will be a real eye-opener .   to me ,  the soldiers represented the current paradigm .  they started out with stock-standard official policy responses to all the pleas of the girls .  as the film progressed ,  they found it more and more difficult to maintain this stance .  when what seems like all of teheran breaks out into wild celebration ,  everyone is caught up in it ,  and the ridiculousness of the current policies is obvious to one and all .   it was a very moving and unexpected ending ,  and gave the film a really nice blend of emotions ,  frivolity ,  drama and social commentary .  though it's adult cinema ,  i think mature-minded children from about seven onwards would really appreciate this film  ( as long as they can read subtitles )  .   it is remarkable that a repressive country like iran is able to produce films of such quality by the likes of panahi and kiarostami .  perhaps the constraints there force directors to be extremely resourceful .  australian  ( and other )  film makers could take a leaf out of their book . 
finally !  an iranian film that is not made by majidi ,  kiarostami or the makhmalbafs .  this is a non-documentary ,  an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the 'system' in its ass .  it's all about football and its funny ,  its really funny .  the director says  " the places are real ,  the event is real ,  and so are the characters and the extras .  this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors ,  as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness .  "  the non-actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a .  your heart is made of stone b .  you are blind .  excellently scripted ,  the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness .  it has won the jury grand prize ,  berlin ,  2006 .  dear reader ,  it's near-perfect .  where ,  where can i get hold of it ? 
i saw this film at the toronto international film festival .  filmed during an actual qualifying match for the 2006 world cup ,  offside works brilliantly as both a comedy and a tragedy .  the film follows the fortunes of a group of young women who are caught trying to sneak into a football match at tehran's azadi stadium .  the country's islamic religious leaders have decreed that women may not sit with men at sporting events ,  lest they be exposed to cursing and other morally questionable behaviour .  this hasn't stopped the country's young female fans ,  who continue to sneak in using various tricks .  but panahi focuses on a small group who have been caught and are being detained agonizingly close to the action .  they beg the bored soldiers guarding them to let them go or at least to let them watch the match .  the soldiers tell them they shouldn't have tried to get in ,  that they could have watched the game at home on tv .  they banter back and forth in almost real-time as the game continues ,  just off- camera .   there is one very funny sequence where a young soldier accompanies one of the girls to the restroom .  since there are no female restrooms at stadiums ,  he has to clear the room of any men before he can allow her to go in .  plus ,  he makes her cover her face so no one can see she's a woman .  this is accomplished using a poster of iranian soccer star ali daei as a mask ,  with eye holes punched out .   you get a real sense that even the soldiers are baffled by the prohibition ,  and are only carrying out their orders so as to hasten the end of their compulsory military service .  one soldier complains that he was supposed to be on leave so he could take care of his family's cattle in the countryside .  little by little ,  the girls and the soldiers talk to each other ,  and there are numerous small acts of kindness on both sides to show that these are basically good people living in terrible circumstances .  however ,  the soldiers' constant reminder that  " the chief "  is on his way lends a sense of menace ,  since we don't know what sort of punishment the women will face .   unlike most iranian films ,  which are known for their strong visuals ,  offside is filmed in a realist style with no artifice .  in fact ,  the film was made during the actual qualifying match against bahrain that took place on june 5 ,  2005 .  the  " plot "  in many ways was determined by the result on the pitch .  if iran won the match ,  they would qualify .  if they lost ,  they would not .  since the world cup has come and gone ,  i don't think it is a spoiler to say that iran won the match .  the scenes of celebration at the end of the film were real and spontaneous ,  which gave the film a real authenticity .  seeing how much this meant to the people of iran was deeply touching .   as well ,  one of the young women makes reference at the end of the film to seven fans who died during the iran-japan match on march 25 ,  just a few weeks before .  they were trampled to death after police began to spray the crowd with water to move them in a certain direction .  knowing that this was a real-life tragedy added another level of poignancy to the celebrations .   i don't want to go off on a long political tangent ,  but this film gave me real hope that there are those in iran who are hoping for change and working at it .  iran is a nation of young people ,  and it is only a matter of time before they take the place of their elders in the political sphere .  films like this one show the proud spirit of the iranian people in spite of their present difficulties ,  and it's my sincere hope that there is a brighter future for them . 
several young iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain .  when they're caught ,  they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot ,  but out of sight .  the prisoners plead to be let go ,  but rules are rules .   given the pedigree of its director ,  jafar panahi ,  it was disarming to discover that offside is a comedy ,  and a frequently hilarious one .  in 1997's the mirror ,  panahi presents two versions of iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is  " real "  .  in 2000's the circle ,  several iranian women step outside the system ;  their transgressions are different ,  but they all end up in the same tragic place .   however ,  thinking now about offside ,  it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy ,  because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous .  as the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer ,  the only possible outcome is comedy .   what makes offside most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system .  they are simply soccer fans and patriots ,  and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly ,  they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation's grasp . 
i found this to be a surprisingly light-handed touch at a 1950's culture-clash movie .  john wayne would hardly be one's first choice as a cultural attache ,  being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in harrods .  but this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona ,  and he accomplished his task with style .  the duke was a guy who really could act well .  his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle .   despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time ,  he failed to dominate this movie .  many of his good intentions came a cropper .  he had authority over nobody ,  and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian .   the story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell-for-leather battles .  i cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well .  there was a great deal of minutely-choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props .  the set pieces were complex and detailed .  a lot of money and thought had been applied to it .   the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added a little extra element ,  and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag-waving effort .  script was good without being too wordy .  there was a great deal of japanese dialogue ,  but the lengthy periods of translation didn't interfere with the narrative .  it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set .  whether or not they were japanese ,  i couldn't say .  but anyway they looked the part .  at least the leads were not played by cross-dressing caucasians ,  unlike other efforts such as 'blood alley'  ( yes ,  i know they were chinese )  'the inn of the sixth happiness' or even 'the king and i' .   frankly ,  i enjoyed this more than any of those other movies .  the script was better for a start .  i never liked the songs in 'the king and i' ,  and wasn't impressed by the heavy-laden anti-communist subtext of 'blood alley' .  i confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the duke's more popular outings .   recommended . 
in the barbarian and the geisha ,  john wayne plays townsend harris ,  a real envoy from the united states who was responsible for truly opening up japan to international relations in the late 1850s .  before him ,  commodore perry basically pushed into japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the japanese in 1853 .  harris ,  who arrived just a bit later ,  worked through the details and helped ensure compliance--as many of the japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty .  all this is true and shown in the film .  according to some other sources i found ,  the romance between harris and a japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film  ( hence ,  the title )  .   my first reaction the first time i saw this movie was one of surprise .  john wayne as a diplomat ?  !  when he's being diplomatic in most films ,  he says please and thank you as he pummels people !  !  !  !  so seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed .  in fact ,  i can't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role .  by the way ,  i've seen photos of harris and wayne has practically no resemblance to him at all .   however ,  despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting ,  the film is still very watchable .  the color cinematography is nice ,  the film shows some nice insights into japanese customs and culture and the acting isn't bad .  all in all ,  a likable and watchable film despite it's odd casting .   ps--read through the trivia for this film .  you find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between wayne and the director  ( john huston )  where wayne apparently knocked him out !  !  based on what i've read about huston and the way he got along with actors ,  this is an incident i tend to believe .  and ,  it's also a nice example of john wayne  " diplomacy "  . 
this is very much not the sort of movie for which john wayne is known .  he plays a diplomat ,  a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action .  the film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story .   for the open-minded ,  the patient and the thoughtful ,  this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of history .   there are two intertwining stories .  the big story is of internalised ,  isolationist japan and externalised ,  expansionist america clashing when their interests conflict .  the small ,  human ,  story is of an outsider barbarian  ( wayne )  and a civilised geisha's initial hostility and dislike turning to mutual respect and love .  the human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations .   the movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well .  the two lead roles are performed to perfection .  john wayne is excellent as townsend harris ,  striking exactly the right blend of force and negotiation in his dealings with the japanese .  eiko ando is likewise excellent as the geisha of the title ,  charming and delightful .  the interaction between her character and john wayne's is particularly well portrayed .  this is exactly how these two individuals  ( as they are depicted in the film )  would have behaved .   the script is very well written .  it lacks all pomposity .  and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred .  the characters are real people ,  not self-consciously  " great "  figures from history .  furthermore ,  the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety .  indeed ,  the clash of a traditionalist ,  and traditionally powerful ,  isolationist japan and a rising ,  newly powerful nation from across the ocean is summarised very well in one exchange between john wayne and the local japanese baron .  wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in japan ,  and that passing ships cannot even put into port for water .  the baron responds that japan just wants to be left alone .  wayne's character replies that japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping ,  and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of brigands infesting an important roadway .  a very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right ,  and saw the other as being in the wrong .  the resultant clash between two self-righteous peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history ,  a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the future .   cinematography and the depiction of mid-nineteenth century japan ,  before the accelerated growth towards industrialisation that was to follow later in the century ,  is excellent .  a visual treat ,  and an enlightening insight into japan's ancient civilisation .   i highly recommend anyone ,  whether a john wayne fan or not ,  to watch this film if you get the chance .  just be aware that it isn't an action film .  it is a representation of an interesting place and time in history ,  and a slow-boiling love story which  ( much to their surprise )  comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters .  watch this film on its merits ,  without preconceptions ,  allow yourself to be immersed in its story ,  and you will thoroughly enjoy it .   all in all ,  an excellent film . 
father of the pride was the best new show to hit television since family guy .  it was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at dreamworks animation .  like the simpsons ,  the show centers around a nuclear family  ( of white lions ,  in this case )  .  it also contains many memorable supporting characters including roger the surly orangutan ,  vincent the italian-american flamingo ,  the eccentric white tigers blake and victoria ,  the faux patriotic snout brothers and chutney the elephant .  the other stars of the show are the sigfreid and roy .  they are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner ,  making the most mundane activities entertaining .  the combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues  ( drugs ,  prejudice ,  etc )  is the source of the program's brilliance .   the blame for this show's failure lies with nbc .  they opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order  ( perhaps being influenced by which guest stars they could promote )  rather than the more logical production order .  several times ,  the show was preempted for an extra half-hour of such dreck as the biggest loser  ( as if 60 minutes of that was not enough )  !  it is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while fear factor and american idol dominate .   luckily ,  the complete series was released on dvd and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following .  10/10
an interesting look at japan prior to opening to the west .  john wayne as america's first consul to japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from perry's gunboat diplomacy .  he is not welcome .  wayne eventually wins his meeting with the shogun after bring a cholera epidemic ,  introduced by an american ship ,  under control .  there follows a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for the shogun ,  including a bottle of old tanglefoot .  the meeting with the shogun ,  the debates among the japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period .  altogether a rather enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the duke lose a fight to a guy half his size . 
if you like film ,  don't miss this one .  if you prefer action ,  or horror ,  or romance ,  then you'll wonder what's happening .  everyone here is stuck in a gangster film .  and what happens is transcendental murder .   there are few similar films .  no doubt it will see limited release ,  and be hard to find .  but the search will be worth it .  if you want to study a mileu as a potential symbol ,  then this is indeed a film to study .   you can't watch it once .  if you do you'll never see what's happening .  dark city is better .  joe vrs .  the volcano is more fun .  but mad dog time could convert the gangsta crowd to symbolism .   .   . or at least to think twice before shooting again . 
hint number one - read the title as  " the time of the mad dog ,  "  or perhaps dogs .  this is a pretty good ensemble piece  ( look at the cast and rent it - you know you're curious already )  ,  and first-time director bishop gives them their chance ,  taking his time ,  letting the characters interact and chew the scenery as they wait - not enthusiastically - for the return of  " the big boss "  and whatever revenge ensues .   for some of us ,  the highlight is seeing christopher jones after his self-imposed exile from films ;  he remains a commanding film presence .  and yes ,  with christopher jones ,  larry bishop and richard pryor involved ,  this is the  " wild in the streets "  reunion party ! 
before i start ,  i should point out that i know the editor of this film .  we've never met ,  but we belong to the same fanzine ( those things which came before message boards )  ,  and we have talked on the phone ,  so i do have a bias here .  anyway .  .  .   somehow ,  it's ironic how while the  " rat pack "  culture of the late 50's and early to mid-60's made a comeback in the mid-90's ,  this movie ,  from the son of one of the original rat pack ,  and which was made in a similar fashion ,  was a flop .  not only that ,  it was a critical flop ;  i believe peter travers of rolling stone was the only one who did not savage this ( he gave it a mixed review ,  as i recall )  .  and while i don't think this is the greatest film in the world ,  and i am not a fan of the rat pack ,  or  " cocktail ,  "  culture ,  i do think this is worth seeing .   for one thing ,  this looks stylish ,  and moves right along .  for another ,  the core performances are all good .  richard dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the head gangster coming back from a sanitarium ,  and has a droll edge to him .  jeff goldblum goes back to the quietly ironic performances he gave in his pre-blockbuster days ,  like the big chill .  and while ellen barkin is only required to vamp in this movie ,  she does it entertainingly .  admittedly ,  it's not a great film ;  the dialogue is mostly made up of puns ,  and a lot of them don't work ( like the whole  " zen of ben "  speech )  .  and gabriel byrne and kyle maclachlan are awful here .  still ,  i was entertained ,  and if you like gangster films ,  you might be too . 
it was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all-star flick .  i laughed through the entire picture ,  as did my entire family .  the movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy--the players were hysterical--i'll bet they had a good old time while making it .  of course goldblum and dreyfuss were great--and how about those everly sisters ,  each of the two falco's ,  and the divine music throughout .  rob reiner made a great laughing limo driver ,  and gabriel byrne a laughable neurotic .  not to mention gregory hines ,  burt reynolds ,  the sleepy joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references .  paul anka was his usual entertaining self ,  with the added attraction of running scared after byrne decided to make a duet of his  " my way "  welcome home to vick performance .   i am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to frank sinatra and friends ;  dreyfuss imitated him well .  i am also of the opinion that no one ,  of any age ,  would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie--it's a joke--not a terrifying  " gangsta "  film .  the cars and clothing were impressive ,  as was the decorative ,   " vic's place .  "   truly ,  i think of  " mad dog time "  as a musical comedy ,  less harmful than many cartoons ,  tv crime dramas ,  and talk shows .  i would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment . 
i love this movie .  it's wacky ,  funny ,  violent ,  surreal ,  played out in a madman's head ,  and definitely not your usual comedy .    if you don't find the film amusing then i guess it's just not for your tastes ,  so this is a tough one to write a review for .   for reference ,  some other comedies i love are the big lebowski ,  the princess bride ,  and zoolander  ( that one only got me the second time around )  .  there are others ,  but my taste is definitely for the unusual ,  and i am willing to accept that most people just don't tend to like that kind of thing .  i make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour - at least i have one .   the scenes and characters of this particular movie are well put together ,  the verbal humour is hilarious ,  the situations are intriguing ,  the acting is very good  ( as you would expect of the cast )  ,  though the acting demands made of the cast by the script are not particularly high .  the overall package makes for fun ,  funny ,  watchable yet violent entertainment . 
this has to be one of my favourite movies of all time .  the dialogue ,  with the constant use of puns is very tight ,  the cast are superb ,  and the plot is highly original .   don't take my word for it - watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself . 
simply ,  one of the funiest movies i've ever seen .  it's a parody of crime-life ,  parody of everything that represents the chicago 1930 . - there is no realy need to underestimate this movie because rating is under 5 .  its a opinion of a mass ,  and mass is hypnotized .  who decide to watch it - it will regret ,  who decide not to watch it - will regret more . 
loopy ,  but shrewd and formidable mob boss vic  ( an excellent performance by richard dreyfuss )  gets released from a mental hospital .  several of vic's fellow criminal cohorts who include volatile henchman  " brass balls "  ben london  ( a gloriously manic and over-the-top hammy portrayal by gabriel byrne )  ,  the smarmy jake parker  ( a perfectly smug kyle maclachlan )  ,  and vicious rival  " wacky "  jacky jackson  ( a neat turn by burt reynolds )  all try to bump vic off .  meanwhile ,  laid-back and self-assured hit-man mickey holliday  ( nicely played with low-key confidence by jeff goldblum )  finds himself caught in the middle of all this deadly lunacy .  writer/director larry bishop brings a supremely hip ,  quirky ,  and original idiosyncratic sensibility to this deliciously dark and deadpan pitch-black comedy about betrayal ,  loyalty ,  and ruthless ambition run dangerously amok .  the bang-up cast have a field day with the colorfully grotesque rogues' gallery of blithely amoral and treacherous hoodlums :  ellen barkin as tough ,  sultry moll rita everly ,  henry silva as vic's reliable right-hand man sleepy joe carisle ,  gregory hines as philosophical smoothie jules flamingo ,  diane lane as vic's sweet ,  perky mistress grace ,  billy drago as the slimy wells ,  and christopher jones as brutish rub-out artist nicholas falco .  bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace assassin nick .  popping up in nifty bits are billy idol as a blustery thug ,  michael j .  pollard as the ill-fated red ,  joey bishop as mortician mr .  gottlieb ,  rob reiner as a jolly chauffeur ,  and richard pryor as jimmy the gravedigger .  byrne's delightfully insane duet with singer paul anka on  " my way "  rates as a definite sidesplitting highlight .  a tense and amusing climactic mexican stand-off likewise tickles the funny bone something hysterical .  frank byers' slick cinematography ,  the outrageously nutty dialogue ,  earl rose's jazzy cocktail lounge score ,  and a choice soundtrack of vintage swinging golden oldies all further enhance the engagingly peculiar charm of this immensely entertaining one-of-a-kind curio . 
this is no art-house film ,  it's mainstream entertainment .    lot's of beautiful people ,  t&a ,  and action .  i found it very entertaining .  it's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating ,  it's a fun film to watch !  jesse and chace are funny too ,  which is just gravy .  definitely worth a rental .   so in summary ,  i'd recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl  ( if she likes to see other girls get it on !  )   the villains are good too .  vinnie ,  corey large ,  the hatian guy from heroes .  very nasty villains . 
i don't know much about the rat pack ,  and frank sinatra always seemed a bit too self-consciously full of himself to me .  so when i call this one of my all-time faves ,  it's nothing to do with a tribute-band mentality .  as another reviewer says ,  mad dog time is about symbolism ,  not realism .  it's kafkaesque  ( a pity kyle maclachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd ,  when he was so good as josef k )  ,  it's stylish ,  knowing ,  sardonic and slick .  jeff goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of characters ,  trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily ,  trying to stay abreast of what he knows and others don't ,  whom he can outshoot and whom he can't .  gabriel byrne and richard dreyfuss  ( his best performance )  have a ball ,  and the supporting cast look spot-on .  the symbolism ,  the settings  ( the one outdoor motion shot with jeff goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much lounge lizardry )  ,  the dialogue  ( style ,  not practicality ,  is the order of the day )  ,  it's all about characters interacting ,  not really gangsterism .  fun to watch ,  must've been fun to do .  what the critics were up to is really a mystery .  .  . 
i originally saw this very dark comedy around 2000 or so on cable tv .  what a surprise and delight !  everyone is covertly armed in this movie !  dreyfuss plays the  " mental "  don  ( remember the new york don who was supposed to be schizophrenic ?  art imitates life or vice-versa ?  )  .  diane lane and ellen barkin are at their most beautiful and not to be toyed with !  thus proving that beauty and toughness do go together !  then there is the great  " bullshit "  scene between barkin and jeff goldblum  ( rita and mickey )  where they verbally play off the world  " bullshit .  "  this film is both subtle and bald .  for all the shooting ,  it can be a very quiet film .  and ,  you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or near final roles .  joey bishop .  richard pryor .  henry silva .  it is not a film for everyone .  but ,  if you like a film that has a lot of word play and keeps moving without blowing up everything in sight ,  this is the film for you .  roger ebert dumps on this film .  he's flat wrong .  this is a fine ,  fine film !  maybe just not one for ebert .  i consider it as a 10 because of how well it is done and how funny the script can be ,  while not really being a straight comedy kind of film .  i like it so well that i bought it on dvd because it just doesn't get shown very much on cable tv .  now ,  it's all mine ! 
most of the comments have been positive but i would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets .  the set designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings ,  stairs ,  doors ,  furniture and so forth .  it is worth paying attention to .  the movie is driven by characterization and symbolism which is very rich .  all the gangster actors were cast - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat .  the dialog was amusing at times but stilted at times and i suppose it was meant to be that way .  this is a film buff's film .  it was made by people ,  for people who love the medium .  don't miss this one . 
when seeing this movie you should take notice to that it´s not a normal movie .  it has no real story just characters ,  a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony .  the dialogue is wonderful ,  you can just lay back and listen .  the movie stands out thats why it´s hard to find a right way of describing it .   thats why the user comments on this movie is so mixed .   i for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one-liners and things that differ from the  " normal "  .  you can´t really put the finger on what´s so wonderful about it it´s just a comical world where gangsters rule .  a place of love and danger .  a movie that you can see more than one time . 
this movie is great .  simply .  it is rare that you find a comedy with levels ,  and this is a bloody good example of such .  when i saw this movie first ,  as the credit rolled ,  a friend and i looked to one another and asked .  .  .  'did you just catch that ? ' for those doubters ,  look at the levels .  see the comparisons between vick and the people in the club ,  the dna !  see the diverse characters ,  each jostling for position ,  and if you see nothing else ,  see the connection between the cure of vick and the path through the film .  it's all in vick's head !  the opening line about vick's world .  the closing scene with the camera going into vick's head ,  and inside ,  a whole universe !  thoroughly quotable ,  wonderful cartoon gangsters ,  beautiful ,  beautiful ,  beautiful ! 
this a superb self-contained work that is unconnected with anything before or after .  brat pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice ,  but in this law-free world they make an alluring ambiance .  the film is packed with our guys ,  distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances .  the dialogue is a joy .  in fact it's a new vernacular .  one of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with deepening appreciation .   highpoints include billy idol's british loutishness ,  ben london's vulturine brassware ,  kyle's squirmishness ,  and the survey of ad hoc philosophies . 
the world is a terrible place .  but this movie is farce and it's fun .  and if you don't like it .  .  .  you don't get it .  .  .  and if you don't get .  .  .  it doesn't matter .  it's up to you if you want to play along .  every actor in this one had fun .  it's only a joke .  and that's good enough for me .  gabriel byrne is priceless .  byrne and paul anka doing my way is ,  as  " vic "  puts it ,   "  .  .  . the best version ever "  .  okay .  .  .  it's no masterpiece ,  but it's not bad .  i was warned against seeing it ,  but i'm sure glad i did .  .  . 
not a movie for everyone ,  but this movie is in my top 10 .  i am a lover of black comedy .  with a cast including richard dreyfus  ( vic )  ,  jeff goldblum  ( mick )  ,  larry bishop  ( nick )  and gabriel byrne  ( ben 'brass balls' london )  in the leads ,  the lines can't help but be dry .  the supporting cast is nearly dead center .  counting the minor flaws in the movie :  ellen barkin's make-up gave her face has a washed out look ;  there were a couple of gimme cameos by joey bishop and richard pryor that served no purpose ,  and michael j .  pollard's screen time was too short .  over all ,  the cast was just incredible without egos to wreck a fine script .  if you have seen larry bishop's  ( writer ,  director )  film ,  underworld  ( a dark crime flick )  ,  you will enjoy this one .  his next outing  ( writer ,  director ,  actor )  is hell ride with michael madsen and quentin tarantino . 
i'm sure that most people already know the story-the miserly ebenezer scrooge gets a visit from three spirits  ( the ghosts of christmas past ,  present and yet to come )  who highlight parts of his life in the hopes of saving his soul and changing his ways .  dickens' classic story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite .   while i grew up watching the 1951 version starring alastair sims ,  and i believe that he is the definitive scrooge ,  i have been impressed with this version ,  which was released when i was in high school .  george c .  scott plays a convincing and mean ebenezer scrooge ,  and the actors playing the ghosts are rather frightening and menacing .  david warner is a good bob cratchit as well .   this version is beautifully filmed ,  and uses more modern filming styles  ( for the 1980's )  which make it more palatable for my children than the 1951 black and white version .   this is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that i watch almost every year at some point in the christmas season . 
if you are used to seeing gabriel byrne in serious roles such as tom in millers crossing or keaton in the usual suspects i recommend you take a look at this film .  even if you are not a fan of gabriel byrne in particular ,  all the actors in this film give really great performances .  if you've got about eleven bucks  ( that is close to nine quid )  i say order it online ,  or rent it from you favorite movie rental place .  guaranteed to make you laugh ,  whether or not you normally like gangster type movies .  mad dog time/trigger happy is one of those movies you never forget ,  and find yourself watching over and over .  you will talk about it so much your friends will be begging to borrow it . 
dear god where do i begin .  this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen .  the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best .  why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand .  another is the cast .  it is great .  this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure .  i know some of you out there are probably thinking  " no way he has plenty better "  but no your wrong .  raptor island is a work of art .  i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors .  i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever . 
wow ,  how can i even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes ?  it was surely the highlight of my year--nay--my life .  as if the raptor graphics weren't amazing enough ,  the award-winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie ,  even when the background didn't actually match up with the setting of the scene .  wow ,  what genius .  and while the movie is full of plot-holes  ( for instance ,  a few clips of a t-rex type animal where a raptor should be and one key moment where pappy finds a torture chamber ,  screams  " colin's a girl !  "  and runs out )  i will never forget the brilliance that is raptor planet .  thank you sci-fi for another classic . 
my first child was born the year this program came out ,  and i played the record album for the boys every christmas thereafter .  when the cd came out ,  i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families .  .  . it invariably becomes their favorite christmas album .  i recently found several dvd's  ( made on dvd-r from video tapes ,  probably )  for sale on ebay .  the one i bought was an excellent copy ,  and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years .  there are some songs on the show that were not on the album ,  and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show .  but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever . 
i enjoy all the versions of this story but this one is my all time favorite .  george c . scott gives a depth to the scrooge character that the others do not give .  the movie shows more about why he becomes so bitter .  the changes in scrooge appear gradually as he encounters the different ghosts and the incidents that they show him .    this movie has the best tiny tim by far .  he is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other films .  anthony walters still has all or most of his baby teeth .    david warner is wonderful as bob cratchit .  he is such a versatile actor .  he portrays a man who clearly loves his family .  he plays the role with dignity neither as a wimpy man cowering under scrooges'thumb but as a man who gracefully puts up with it because he has a family to provide for .  susannah york and the other actors do a fine job of bringing the characters to life .  edward woodward is the best ghost of christmas present i've ever seen .  most often he is played as a jolly santa type character .  in this he shows anger at scrooges attitudes and really makes scrooge reconsider .    the costumes and the sets really bring the london of dickens time to life .  a wonderful movie . 
this was the worst movie i've ever seen ,  yet it was also the best movie .  sci fi original movie's are supposed to be bad ,  that's what makes them fun !  the line ,   " i like my dinosaur meat well done !  "  is probably the best quote ever !  also ,  the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream .  i can imagine it now ,  the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution ,  then putting ideas together for this :  space marines got to alien planet ,  which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it ,  to protect a science team studying the planet .  best idea ever !  in fact ,  in fits the complete sci fi original movie checklist :  guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible acting  so go watch this movie ,  but don't buy it . 
i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors .  i like raptors because they are scary .  my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana .   i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it's got a good ending even though i didn't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and that's the important part .  the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you're watching it the first time .   this is best movie . 
i liked this show a lot - we got the first and only ,  it would appear ,  series in the uk on channel 4 .  the characterisation was right on the money - a bit like the simpsons in that all the different facets of small town populace were represented .   there was no laughter track - i hadn't seen this on an american tv comedy at the time except for on larry sanders and it really worked well here ,  heightening the suggestion that these wacky cops were really like that ,  and not just hamming it up for the cameras .   all in all ,  a quirky little number that tickled me just right :  i can't help but think that maybe it missed it's mark with certain audiences .  i think it would have been a cult hit in the uk had it been shown at an acceptable hour .   i'll round this off with my standard comment :  where the hell can i get hold of this to watch it again ?  any ideas ? 
only saw this show a few times ,  but will live in my memory .    it is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless repeats of stuff like friends !  especially even more difficult to obtain being in england i guess .  .  ?   they say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the bakersfield pd themselves ?  maybe it was just too clever for certain people ?    anyhow ,  just about the one comedy i would love to see again but is almost impossible to find .  i hear it is being or has been repeated on another network ?  but alas not over here !  !   summary :  ingenious . 
prominent attorney walter pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono ,  wins an acquittal and discovers that his client  ( keefe braselle )  was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring reaching to the highest eschelons of the city .  panged by his own complicity ,  he undertakes an investigation ,  stumbles onto the identity of the  " unknown man "  who heads the syndicate ,  and murders him .   the ironies engage when braselle is charged with this second murder and pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another  " unknown man "  -- himself .  though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric ,  the unknown man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of american municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years . 
walter pidgeon is braley mason ,  a civil attorney who takes on a criminal case in  " the unknown man ,  "  a 1951 film also starring ann harding ,  barry sullivan ,  keefe braselle ,  and richard anderson .  a great believer in justice ,  pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man ,  rudi walchek  ( braselle )  accused of murder and gets him acquitted .  shortly afterward ,  he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood .  he is advised by the da  ( sullivan )  that rudi is small change ,  that to wipe out the organized crime ,  one has to find the top man .  mason finds the top man ,  and is faced with a dilemma .    " the unknown man "  is a small ,  black and white film that manages to hold the viewer's interest with its various plot twists ,  though the plot is somewhat contrived .  it's really the story of a good man seeking his god ,  justice ,  and what he is willing to do in order to attain it .  and that's the most contrived part of all .  i suppose there was a time before o . j .  ,  the menendez brothers ,  etc .  ,  etc .  ,  when people believed in justice and the integrity of attorneys .  for this viewer anyway ,  those days are long over .   walter pidgeon does an excellent job -- his handsome ,  elegant demeanor and declamatory voice show us a successful ,  confident man but also a deeply caring one .  pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years but never really rose to superstardom .  he was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did .  it may be because by the time he was getting leads ,  he was well into his thirties and missed being a matinée idol ;  or it could be he lacked that certain something ;  or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like greer garson .  hard to say .  he gives an honest and touching performance here .   very good movie with good performances . 
i've seen this film criticized with the statement ,   " if you can get past the moralizing .  .  .  "  that misses the point .  moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder ,  as it were .  this is a decent film with a standard murder mystery ,  but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through .  the resolution leaves the viewer wondering ,   " what would i have done in this position ?  "  and i have to believe that's exactly what the filmmaker intended .  to that end ,  and to the end of entertaining the audience ,  the film succeeds .  i also like the way that the violence is never on stage ,  but just off camera .  we know what has just happened ;  it's just not served up in front of us ,  then rubbed in our faces ,  as it would be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing .  besides ,  the violence is not the point .  the point is the protagonist's moral dilemma ,  which is cleverly ,  albeit disturbingly ,  resolved . 
red skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease .   his shows certainly brought a laughter to the american households of years back .   he would begin the show with an opening monologue .  afterwards ,  we would have a variety of characters .  remember gertrude and heathcliff in the monologue ?  how can we ever forget san fernando red ?  i remember one episode where as a king red introduced his queen by referring to her as your fatness .   go know that red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life .  he lost a son to leukemia at age 11 or so .  his wife ,  georgia ,  died by suicide . 
 .  .  .  .  .  .  . playing kaddiddlehopper ,  col san fernando ,  etc .  the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream .  i love watching him interact w/ amanda blake ,  or don knotts or whomever--he clearly was having a ball and i think he made it easier on his guests as well--so long as they knew ahead of time it wasn't a disciplined ,  19 take kind of production .  relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there .   he reminds me of guys like milton berle ,  benny hill ,  maybe jerry lewis some too .  great timing ,  ancient gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades ,  sheer enjoyment about what he was doing .  his sad little clown he played was good too--but in a touching manner .   personally i think he's great ,  having just bought a two dvd set of his shows from '61 or so ,  it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me .  i can remember seeing him on tv at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so .   check this out if you are a fan or curious .  he was a riot . 
an mgm miniature short subject .   the editor of the cole county clarion must decide what is the real important news for his readers :  an impending frost which may spell disaster to their crops ,  or the sensational shooting-down of a notorious gangster on their small town main street .   this is an enjoyable little one-reeler ,  featuring a good performance by comic charles `chic' sale .  today's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of uncredited james stewart ,  as sale's nephew/assistant .  slow talking & somewhat goofy ,  stewart shows many of the attributes which would make him a huge star in a very short time .   often overlooked or neglected today ,  the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents ,  both in front & behind the camera .  the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film ,  something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel .  economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material ,  short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios' feature films . 
*********ten out of ten stars*********   it's hard to believe this was a made for television movie .  just the phrase ,   " made of tv "  ,  makes me shudder .  the production values for made for tv movies are almost always remarkably lower than production values for professional movie studios .  that being said ,  this version of the  " christmas carol "  should have been released in theaters ,  because it is that good .  it's my personal favorite of all the  " christmas carol "  movies because every aspect of this production are of the highest quality .  yes ,  there are some minor on screen glitches with two of the ghosts that visit scrooge ,  but there isn't a movie in existence that doesn't have at least a couple of mistakes .   scott turns in a stellar performance as scrooge ,  he's a pleasure to watch .  in fact ,  i can't think of one performance in this film that shouldn't be applauded .  the costuming ,  location shooting ,  and winter backdrop are mesmerizing .  the musical score is endearing and heart warming .  add to that ,  solid directing ,  flawless cinematography ,  and faithful scripting ;  we have here what will one day be considered a holiday classic .  it really hasn't been around long enough to be a classic ,  but mark my words ,  one day soon it will be .  this film has turned into a yearly christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind christmas :  love ,  selflessness ,  and giving .  in as selfish ,  greedy world ,  my family and i can lose ourselves in  " the christmas carol "  ,  starring george c .  scott . 
as romantic comedies go ,  this was a cute and winning one .  i thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better ,  but that is not a huge tripping point .  but ,  amanda detmer and scott wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever .  these are two of my favorite actors ,  and i was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads .  i hope to see them cast in more projects soon .   overall ,  this movie won't change your life ,  but is is sweet ,  warm and winning .  not a bad thing to be at all . 
i´m glad that someone has made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for a second time .  or third .  this movie is exactly what it promises to be - lovely ,  amusing and it gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends .  the plot might be not very inventive ,  but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not been all used yet .  the cast is perfectly selected although scott wolf does not look like a father of an eight year old not even when he is wearing a suit .  so ,  the sparks are on all the right places ,  supporting cast is lovably supporting and although you could probably predict the whole movie you would not want to switch the channel .  it is just the right sort of entertainment for a sunday evening . 
for me this movie was powerful .  i don't want to be a spoiler ,  but i had a friend years ago ;  we were like brothers .  this movie brought back some vivid memories .   for some reason ,  i couldn't place my vote for this movie which would have been a 10 .  i kept getting a message like  " no votes have been placed .  .  .  .  "  and yet i saw in the stats that there were .  will try again tomorrow  ( monday )  .   minor flaws i overlooked .  it was the relationships between the characters that got me .  beautifully acted and real situations .  i've been in a couple of them .   a small gem of a movie .  just like  " spring forward "  is another overlooked gem .  i'm very glad movies like these are still being made ;  about relationships between people ,  well written ,  sensitively unfolded with first-class acting and direction .  after all ,  isn't that what it's all about ? 
i've read a few of the reviews and i'm kinda sad that a lot of the story seems glossed over .  its easy to do because its not a book ,  its a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie- us or canadian- or anywhere .   colm feore does ,  at least for a recovering  " f@g-hag "  like myself ,  a great job of not only playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man- but playing sick .  i mean ,  the man really can't get much more pale !  though ,  you might never know it from the strip down near the .  .  .  um ,  end .   if you need decrepit ,  there are a few sking movies you might like .   being the daughter of a recovering alchoholic ,  the druggie brother {david cubitt} was the trick for me .  i'm going to give him cred ,  he grew up quick- and believe me that's good .  and ,  as an aspiring writer ,  moimeme ,  i can dig a lot of his insights and overviews .  but i'm more prosy than poetic .   i may be easy to please ,  but i enjoyed it .  a nice story pretty well put together- by canadians ,  quelle surprise .  just toed the line of the 'movie of the week , ' missing it by not being as drawn out ,  greatly appreciated .  and it was rather cleverly portrayed . 
i have found this movie available for streaming on netflix and thought i'd give it a try .   the plot revolves around ryan and theo taylor  ( colm feore and david cubitt )  who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away .  ryan and theo at first argue about who did what .  but later ,  theo finds out that his brother ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness .  so ,  ryan and theo spend their time patching up their differences .   this is such an incredible film .  i have only seen colm feore in season 7 of 24 but he was phenomenal in this .  david cubitt ,  an actor i have never heard of before did a phenomenal job as well .   i would recommend this to those who are interested in the gay and lesbian genre .  this is one movie you don't want to miss .   i give this film 10 stars out of 10 .  excellent film ! 
i have to be honest and say i bought this movie ,  not because of the content ,  but because david cubitt is in it ;  i know  .  .  .  shallow ,  or what ?  - but ,  come on ,  mr cubitt is a fantastic actor to put it mildly .   i really didn't know what to expect from watching this movie ,  i'd read the other write up ,  and those on other sites but i have to say i was drawn into the world of the brothers almost from the get go .  david cubitt as theo ,  and colm feore as ryan are so believable as the two estranged brothers ,  the film moves through their relationship as they start to try getting to know each other again after their fathers death .  the scene where theo finds out ryan is gay was played brilliantly ,  he literally walks in on a scene and tries to leave without ryan noticing - which of course he has .   the film has been very well researched and is therefore incredibly sad ,  moving ,  uplifting and a celebration of life in parts .  i came away from this feeling sad at what ryan went through but also with the knowledge that he was given hope and unconditional love by the ex drug addict brother theo .  i agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where theo says he will be a father moving ,  and i'd go a little further to say i actually vocalised my thoughts at ryan when he cruelly says to theo 'what makes you think you can be a father' and theo says simply 'you . ' theo walks away then ,  but that small exchange of dialogue speaks volumes to the almost self pitying aspect of ryan who is brought up sharply by the simple retort .   a brilliantly conceived movie on all counts ,  the acting ,  directing ,  writing etc are all so well done .  i can't really find anything else to say about this movie ,  except to say that it is very hard dealing with the death of a loved one but this is done superbly ,  to the infinite degree .  the respect for the subject matter and the outpouring of love  ( without being contrite and mawkish )  speaks volumes in this rather selfish world we live in today .  well done to all concerned .   not many movies bring me to tears and give me pause to think about life in general ,  and also to be glad for all the things i have and not be sad for the things i don't ,  but this movie did ,  it was unbelievably uplifting considering the subject matter . 
i am writing this after just seeing the perfect son at the 2002 gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival in sydney ,  australia .   when their father dies ,  two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from aids ,  they enter on a heart warming journey of reconciliation .  the two leads do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses .  i do have one qualm about the movie though - whilst the brother who is dying acts sick ,  he doesn't look it .  a person of 0 t4 cells would look quite ill - not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed .  a small gripe ,  but one that makes it a bit less realistic .  despite that one small gripe ,  the perfect son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it- do .  i'm hoping for a dvd release in the near future ! 
the perfect son is a story about two 30-something brothers ,  one who is seemingly  " perfect "  and the other who is basically a screw-up ,  frequently landing himself in drug rehab centers .  after the death of their father ,  the two are brought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resurfaces .  it isn't until the  " perfect "  brother makes the startling revelation that he has aids that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order ,  and take some responsibility .   the movie does a nice job of chronicling the younger brother's  " comeback "  ,  though it may seem a bit far-fetched at times  ( beating drug addiction is never so easy )  .  what makes the film more tender is the treatment of aids ,  a topic that has become somewhat passe in cinema over the last 5-10 years .  and also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly feuding brothers is very believable and well-done .  the two main actors were both very competent ,  if not terribly charismatic .   a solid first feature effort from director and writer leonard farlinger whose own brother died of aids .  the ending is nicely done as well .   
i have seen the perfect son about three times .  i fail to see how this film is a gay film ,  i am not even gay ,  but i don't see it as a gay film .  it is a film with a gay character ,  i can't see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay .  i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death ,  the death of someone who is your kin .  i think theo turns his life around fairly quickly after rehab because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him reassess his life .  i found the dialog in the scene when theo tells ryan he is going to be a father to be very moving ,  ryan states that he doesn't want to know about the things he is never going to see or share with anyone .  isn't that horrific and sad ?  i highly recommend the film . 
 " dangerous offender "  is the story of a seemingly anti-social girl ,  and how she got that way .  it's based on a true story ,  and though i was irritated by the one-note depiction i . e .  ever scowling ,  of the title character ,  and the hard-to-believe dedication of her lawyer ,  i'm forced to accept that life does imitate art ,  and that there are people out there like that .   the movie succeeds ,  for me ,  because ,  although there's little softening of the title character's demeanour until almost the end ,  one is gradually moved to sympathy for her ,  as the movie shows how she got to her present state - which proves to be self-destructive ,  rather than anti-social .   truly a moving movie ,  which will bring a lump to your throat ,  when you think on it - which will be often .   despite its many flaws ,  ( including that it's hard to watch ,  sometimes ,  because of bodily functions ,  and suicide attempts ) this is another production that i'm proud to call canadian . 
i saw this movie in sixth grade around christmas time ,  and i was really excited about seeing it ,  and when i heard that george c .  scott was in it ,  i was really excited ,  because i really love george c .  scott !  when me and my class were watching this movie ,  i was really into it ,  and when it was over ,  i was really impressed ,  i thought that it was totally fabulous !  this is the best version of charles dickens' classic novel that i have seen so far !  george c .  scott's performance as scrooge is something else ,  i thought that he was the perfect choice ,  he was scrooge ,  he is the definitive scrooge !  i've seen two different versions of a christmas carol ,  the other is the one with patrick stewart ,  but this is the better one !    what it really great about this is the acting ,  i thought that the actors were fabulous ,  everyone was ,  the spirits ,  tiny tim ,  bob cratchit ,  everyone ,  they could not have found anyone better than the ones they had doing the parts !  but the best part of the movie was george c .  scott !  when i saw him ,  i thought that he was the absolute best !  he is the definitive ebenezer scrooge ,  i do not think that they could have found someone better !  i don't think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie !    this movie is probably the definitive movie adaption of the classic by charles dickens ,  and i really think that you will agree ,  you will think that this movie is fabulous !  i am probably going to have to buy this movie on dvd ,  because i thought that it was totally fabulous !  i totally recommend that you see this masterpiece !  this is the best version of a christmas carol ,  period .    10/10
this film was on last week and although at that time of the day  ( around 6pm )  the quality of the movies is almost never good  ( at least here on mexican tv )  ,  i couldn't switch the tv off .  the story about madelene moore really touches you .  she doesn't come across as a very sympathetic character at first ,  but seeing the whole film ,  you just want her so succeed .  this film really leaves you thinking .  and i think that basically due to the great acting of brooke johnson .  i had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film ,  but this was great great acting .  compliments to brooke .  i hope to see her in another film soon . 
this is a great film .  touching and strong .  the direction is without question breathless .  good work to the team .  i feel so sorry for marlene ,  by the grace of god go you or i
having lived in ontario my whole life ,  in the same town that marlene moore grew up in ,  i've heard stories of her from my parents ,  grandparents and family members .  so when i found out that they would be filming a movie about her ,  and that the beginning would be shot on my street ,  and her house quite close to mine i was excited .   if you read the book rock a bye baby ,  which is about marlene moore you get quite the different image of her as a person ,  she was considered awkwardly beautiful by people who really had the chance to know her with the exception of her own family who frequently abused her as a child ,  with the exception of one of her brothers .  also ,  if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school you'd find out that she was truly wounded before she even set foot in an institution ,  she was always defensive and what would seem like an unwillingness to learn in a school environment was actually embarrassment over the fact that she was unable to .   marlene did not deserve the life she was given ,  with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive .  it was the government and the people around her that aided further in her death by not attempting to understand her needs and why she did what she did .  i still find myself angered that she was put in jail for self-defense from a man who tried to rape her .  as her brother once said ,   " they didn't know what to do with her so they locked her away and it killed her .  "  i believe in that with all my heart .   rest in peace marlene ,  you deserve it so much . 
the sensuous nurse  ( 1975 )  was a italian sexual comedy that starred the one time bond girl ursula andress .  man was she hot in this movie .  .  she was stacked and built like a *@#% brick house .  ursula was smoking hot in this movie .  i have never seen a nurse's outfit that filled out before .    ms .  andress stars as a nurse who is hired to take care of a rich elderly man .  even one in the house seems to be knocking the boots .  one night ,  the nurse decides to take the grandson's temperature and give some needed t . l . c .  to her ancient client .  the old man takes to his nurse and this angers the rest of the family .  what kind of job did the family hire her out to do ?  will the geezer fall for her car giver ?  how can she deal with the octogenarian crone and the rest of the family ?  to find out you need to find a copy of the sensuous nurse !  !  italian but badly dubbed into english .   highly recommended . 
anna  ( ursula andress )  is brought in as an official r . n .  by ex-lover benito varotto  ( duilio del prete )  ,  ostensibly to nurse an aging widower ,  count leonida bottacin  ( mario piso )  ,  back to health after a heart attack .  but benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen ,  including american entrepreneur mr .  kitch  ( jack palance )  ,  with ulterior motives ,  reflected by what anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the count .  he has a history of ,  well ,  liking women ,  and would be actually a bit more  " vulnerable "  as he is cured .  the bad guys get derailed as anna does not go along and grows closer to the count .  the ending might be said to be ironic ,  but it is probably better described as predictable .    but so much for plot--this film is totally an erotic comedy ,  from start to finish ,  and oh how good .  there are many nude scenes ,  including ones of anna and jole ,  one of the malevolent heiresses ,  played by luciana paluzzi .  both ursula and luciana are noteworthy continental ex-bond women ,  and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers .  as she did in thunderball  ( remember fiona volpe )  ,  luciana plays a femme fatale ,  sort of ,  although less elegantly .   perhaps the best scene is anna's  ( slow )  complete strip and jump in bed with the young adone ,  the  " other patient "   ( who incredibly is resisting )  ,  in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot .  but even at this point she is already two-faced  ( for the better )  ,  for she has decided not to go along .  however ,  benito is more than a two-timer with women ,  having had lengthy flings in the past with both anna and jole ,  and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective-filled  ( to put it mildly )  argument between him and jole .  this is a standing-up encounter in which luciana is down to black panties only .  another nice one is ursula swimming fully naked in the estate's pool .  the count is free ,  as the client ,  to put his hands wherever he wants to on ursula ,  and he takes advantage .  hey ,  somehow i've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions .  erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase .   " the sensuous nurse "  is compact ,  77 minutes ,  but it doesn't need to be--it is enjoyable without interruption ,  start to finish .  definitely recommended .   
german private tv is ill-renowned for copying dutch and  naturally  us formats .  well ,  in the case of edel & starck ,  the xeroxing only went as far as the basics :  screwball .   you can't stand screwball comedy ?  don't watch edel & starck .  seriously .  if you expect yet another lawyers' drama thingy similar to law&order or something ,  well ,  go somewhere else .   ( or watch law&order as it's quite brilliant at what it does ,  but i digress .  )  e&s is funny ,  often addresses thought-provoking themes ,  is funny ,  romantic ,  funny ,  funny ,  and witty ,  too .   frankly ,  i am quite dismayed the writers didn't get better deals after the serial's final .  and my cynical nature needs to readjust itself re :  private german television productions .  german residents will understand what i'm talking about .   in short :  watch it .  i don't have the foggiest what the english synchronisation is like ,  but hey ,  it's worth learning german just to watch them four seasons .  pseudo-happy end included . 
this series it's  " something different "  .  sometimes european series are less accurate than the usa ones ,  but this time authors have hit the right target creating a mix that works in a smoothly way .  edel & starck is great ,  it has all :  great plot ,  smart ,  witty ,  always well delivered lines ,  an amazing theatrical timing showed by all the stars and beautiful shots of berlin ,  one of the most interesting city in the world .  it's entertaining to see how things works in the justice field in other countries than the usa and for once  " feel "  the old europe way of dealing with life .  kudos to all the cast and crew for a well done comedy that is going to be a must to see in the years to come . watching the series in german is super . 
true ,  the idea for this tv series may have sprung from the immense success which ally mcbeal is enjoying worldwide ,  even here in germany .  however ,  this said ,  edel & starck is very different from ally mcbeal in many ways .   the two main characters work beautifully together .  felix edel  ( felix noble )  ,  played by well-known german actor ,  christoph m .  ohrt and sandra starck  ( sandra strong - noble & strong ,  get it  ?  ?  ?  )  ,  played by charming rebecca immanuel ,  exchange quick romantic repartees and continually spy on each other while engaging in sitcom-like criminal cases in berlin and surroundings .  further ,  they are aided by a magnificent cast of co-stars ,  most notably their secretary ,  played by isabel tuengerthal ,  who is a rare gem with great comic potential .  also the shady wheeler-dealer ,  otto ,  and the noble childhood pal of felix ,  frank ,  work very well ,  not to forget sandra's best friend and room-mate ,  patricia ,  played by the beautiful barbara demmer .   all-in-all a joy to watch on monday nites :  no wonder that the series and its stars have received several prizes .  will felix get sandra  ?   i hope that we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out .  .  .  .  .  .

**possible spoiler*** adam sandler is usually typecast in comedy , but in  " reign "  , gives a deeply moving performance . while there are people who showed courage facing post september 11 , 2001 , sandler plays fineman , a widower who is lonely and  " lost in his own world "  . johnson ( cheadle )  , a practicing dentist , encounters his old college buddy ( sandler ) and wants to catch up on  " old times "  . we see , as in rain man ( dustin hoffman )  , fineman also gets emotional and withdrawn in stressful situations . oldies music , appears to be a comfort and  " psychological "  crutch for him to lean on .   johnson looks for , in fineman , that certain pleasure and ease missing in his family . he also feels unhappy and unsatisfied in his job . in the same instance , he also wants to make sure his friend does not fall through the social  " cracks "  . i came away from this movie , with a different outlook and more sympathetic compassion for grieving families . 
sandler is amazing again .  .  .  i have already become a sandler fan .  this movie is the saddest sandler story .  its expression is fantastic .  i cried more watching click but there are some similar points .  to consider the value of the family before losing it and to be able to say 'i love you' are a few of the most impressive truths in life .  .  .  it is tough ,  it is real .  .  .  and actually there is a real owner of this success ,  binder .  i don't think another director could give these emotions in such a way .    cheadle and burrows are also amazing .  .  .  cheadle is one of my favorites since crash .  don't expect laughing or much positive atmosphere .  .  .  if you are ready to face the realities of life ,  don't miss this movie . 
a powerfully wonderful movie .  you are held in a death-grip once you let yourself get involved with the story .  a successful dentist ,  alan johnson ( don cheadle )  ,  is torn in a life crisis of balancing his career with his family .  he notices his former college roommate charlie fineman ( adam sandler ) and wants to touch base .  he finds that charlie ,  who lost his wife and family in the 9-11 attack on america ,  is no longer in touch with reality .  .  . choosing to involve his mind with his favorite music from the past and video games .  the former roommates rekindle their friendship and strengthen their former bond .  johnson has his friend angela oakhurts ( liv tyler )  ,  a psychiatrist ,  to try and bring charlie out of his grief .  .  . but it is alan that accomplishes in getting his friend to emerge from his deep darkness .  jada pinkett smith plays johnson's wife .  writer and director mike binder plays the role of charlie's attorney/guardian .  also in the cast :  saffron burrows ,  donald sutherland ,  adell modell and robert klein .  outstanding soundtrack featuring the likes of bruce springsteen ,  graham nash ,  pear jam and the pretenders .   note :  i have never been a sandler fan ;  but i found him outstanding in this role .  in some of the scenes ,  i thought out loud .  .  . why has he never been approached to play singer/songwriter bob dylan in a biopic . 
i'm not a fan of adam sandler .  in fact ,  i don't think i've ever liked him in anything i've seen him in .  the opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears .  there was adam sandler ,  playing a somewhat ridiculous looking character riding around new york city on a motor scooter ,  looking pitiful and lost .  typical sandler-type loser character again ,  i thought .  i almost gave up then and there .  but then ,  as i stuck with this ,  i actually discovered something i never knew before :  adam sandler can act !  he is truly outstanding in this movie as charlie ,  a lost and lonely figure ,  whose entire family  ( including the dog )  was killed in one of the hijacked planes on 9/11 and who has apparently lost all touch with reality as a result .  don cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly reconnects with charlie and takes it on as his mission to help him get better .  of course ,  cheadle's alan johnson has his own problems and sources of unhappiness ,  and somehow these two men manage to help each other through their difficulties .  the two of them made a completely believable team ,  and sandler in particular made charlie real ,  working through his emotions and feelings .  this is not a sandler comedy .  if your looking for that go to some of his other ,  sillier ,  stuff .  this is a pretty heavy movie - sometimes sad ,  sometimes hopeful and always engrossing .  there are some funny parts in it .  i loved the scene in which charlie convinces alan to confront his partners by reminding him of how tough he was in college ,  and then the conversation the two of them have afterward .   i personally didn't think that saffron burrows added much to the movie as donna ,  an obviously needy patient of johnson's .  the only reason for the character seemed  ( based on one flashback )  to be that she looked eerily like charlie's late wife ,  but that was never really developed ,  and i just didn't care that much for the character .  do look for the part of the judge ,  however ,  played by donald sutherland ,  who i thought nailed the part bang-on .  as far as i'm concerned ,  though ,  this is sandler's movie ,  and kudos to him for a great performance .  definitely his best in my opinion .  8/10
i have to admit ,  this movie moved me to the extent that i burst in tears .  however ,  i always think about things twice ,  and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as flawless and impeccable ,  i prefer taking the risk of a closer look .   first what's first :  the movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slow-paced movie that doesn't try to blow you away with the actual scenes from 9/11 .  thumbs up for this stroke of genius ,  because ,  unlike stone's world trade center this film fortunately doesn't focus on the attack itself but on the fallout which ,  similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion ,  is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating .  the psychological impact ,  the sheer devastation that 9/11 caused and the havoc it wreaked on the american people is almost palpable in this movie .  i think binder managed an astute observation of the american post 9/11 society and sandler in my opinion sky rocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an oscar .   however :  in the film blood diamond ,  the di caprio character says and i quote :   " ah ,  these americans .  always want to take about their feelings "  .  now ,  i don't want to belittle their sufferíngs ,  but i sure would like to make a comparison .  ever since 9/11 the entire world is confronted with mementos ,  memorials and commemorations of 9/11 .  the hollywood industry and writers such as safran foer more than allude to 9/11 in their works .  now ,  this huge amount of cultural products ,  dealing with 9/11 ,  turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century .  the number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject ,  and i say this with all due respect ,  blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportion .   fact is :  people die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people .  we have a war in iraq ,  in afghanistan ,  in birma and lots of other countries .  on a daily basis ,  we forget about the poverty the african people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the american victims of 9/11 simply because they are black and because their lives don't have much in common with our western lives .  africa neither has the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way america can .  so ,  what i am saying is this :  the reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 9/11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9/11 .  not a day goes by without a newspaper article ,  a film or a book that discusses 9/11 .   in conclusion :  i commiserated with charlie fineman ,  but i wasn't sure whether i had the right to feel for him more than for a hutu who lost his entire family in the rwandan civil war .   you catch my thrift ? 
alan johnson  ( don cheadle )  is a successful dentist ,  who shares his practice with other business partners .  alan also has an loving wife  ( jada pinkett smith )  and he has two daughter  ( camille lache smith & imani hakim )  .  he also let his parents stay in his huge apartment in new york city .  but somehow ,  he feels that his life is somewhat empty .  one ordinary day in the city ,  he sees his old college roommate charlie fireman  ( adam sandler )  .  which alan hasn't seen charlie in years .  when alan tries to befriends with charlie again .  charlie is a lonely depressed man ,  who hides his true feelings from people who cares for him .  since charlie unexpectedly loses his family in a plane crash ,  they were on one of the planes of september 11 ,  2001 .  when alan nearly feels comfortable with charlie .  when alan mentions things of his past ,  charlie turns violent towards alan or anyone who mentions his deceased family .  now alan tries to help charlie and tries to make his life a little easier for himself .  but alan finds out making charlie talking about his true feelings is more difficult than expected .   written and directed by mike bender  ( blankman ,  indian summer ,  the upside of anger )  made an wonderfully touching human drama that moments of sadness ,  truth and comedy as well .  sandler offers an impressive dramatic performance ,  which sandler offers more in his dramatic role than he did on paul thomas anderson's punch-drunk love .  cheadle is excellent as usual .  pinkett smith is fine as alan's supportive wife ,  liv tyler is also good as the young psychiatrist and saffron burrows is quite good as the beautiful odd lonely woman ,  who has a wild crush on alan .  this film was sadly an box office disappointment ,  despite it had some great reviews .  the cast are first-rate here ,  the writing & director is wonderful and russ t .  alsobrook's terrific widescreen cinematography .  the movie has great nyc locations ,  which the film makes new york a beautiful city to look at in the picture .   dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen  ( 2 . 35 : 1 )  transfer and an good-dolby digital 5 . 1 surround sound .  dvd also an jam session with sandler & cheadle ,  an featurette ,  photo montage and previews .  i was expecting more for the dvd features like an audio commentary track by the director and deleted scenes .   " reign over me "  is certainly one of the best films that came out this year .  i am sure ,  this movie looked great in the big screen .  which sadly ,  i haven't had a chance to see it in a theater .  but it is also the kind of movie that plays well on dvd .  the film has an good soundtrack as well and it has plenty of familiar faces in supporting roles and bit-parts .  even the director has a bit-part as byran sugarman ,  who's an actor himself .   " reign over me "  is one of the most underrated pictures of this year .  it is also the best sandler film in my taste since  " the wedding singer "  .  don't miss it .  hd widescreen .   ( **** 1/2 out of ***** )  . 
if you didn't enjoy this movie ,  either your dead ,  or you hate adam sandler or don cheadle .   an excellent cast ,  all of who gave good performances .  this movie proved that adam sandler is good actor ,  despite what critics say .  adam sandler is becoming a very well respected actor .  it all started with his performance in big daddy ,  then he did a couple bad movies ,  then he broke through with terrific performance in 50 first dates ,  the longest yard ,  then click ,  and now reign over me .   back to the movie .  adam sandler plays a man who has lost everything .  the closest thing to family he has are a mother-in-law and father-in-law .  after his old college roommate  ( cheadle )  ran into him ,  he seems to turn his life around .  i will say no more ,  because i do not want to ruin the movie ,  but i strongly recommend this movie .  one of the best movies of 2007 . 
most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about ;  a man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from boston that fateful morning of september 11 ,  2001 .  what you probably won't know before seeing this film is this :  how that would feel ;  what do you do with that ;  and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day ?  the story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then warms up nicely as it gains a little speed while the recently renewed relationship between dentist alan johnson ,   ( don cheadle )  and ex-college roommate charlie fineman ,   ( adam sandler )  solidifies and begins to take shape .  characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact ,  stay with this story ,  and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable - and accurate .  real people inhabit a real situation whereby they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them disintegrates .  the pain inside charlie's soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character brilliantly revealed by sandler ,  as layers of an onion  one layer at a time with lightness and weight combined .  it's so subtle a performance that he sneaks up on you and gets inside your head while you are watching him on screen .  cheadle's alan johnson is equally subtle and very don cheadle .  always watchable ,  the ease that's apparent when cheadle's on screen speaks to his consummate acting skills .  alan's relationship with charlie fineman is delicate in texture ,  just as the situation would demand .  fineman doesn't want friendship ,  nor anybody intruding into his cloistered life and yet ,  the likable quality that alan owns is simple and honest enough to intrigue even a recluse like charlie .  it is alan who has the task of gingerly opening up charlie's carefully sealed life .  there is inherent danger in the process .  the more alan nudges charlie to open up ,  going so far as engaging the services of friend and psychologist angela oakhurst ,   ( liv tyler )  the nearer the danger of pushing charlie over the edge .  it's an abyss that charlie teeters on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to navigate through sheer dint of denial .  he has denied everything that priorly existed for him in order to exist with his loss .  unfortunately ,  his grief is one thing he cannot deny .  sandler withdraws so deeply into his character's pain during the story's unfolding that ,  by the time he meets his demons head-on ,  the viewer shares his pain almost equally .  alan stands beside charlie throughout this exacting process at the risk of lousing up his own perfect home-life - run with admirable grace and efficiency by wife janeane .   ( jada pinkett smith )  while tending to charlie's recovery ,  alan looks inward and recognizes his own silent screams at the death of the independence he once owned and the boy he has lost becoming a man .  his reward for helping charlie is helping himself reconnect with what he has lost .  the theme is much like the fisher king ;  another story of a man who isolates himself to the point of madness from sorrow and loss .  like the fisher king ,  the story concludes with the traditional ,  there is someone for everyone theme .  reign over me's lidia sinclair ,   ( played by the wonderful amanda plummer in the fisher king )  is donna remar ,   ( saffron burrows )  a woman on the verge of breakdown and sketchy patient of johnson's ,  who turns out to be the just unstable enough to complement charlie's borderline insanity .  it's a good ending to the story ,  but the one element probably least likely to ring true .  then again ,  maybe there really is someone for everyone .  devorah macdonald vancouver ,  bc
what we've got here is a situation .  a man is found to be in distress and people want to help him -- in contrasting ways .  at the end they are forced to let it go .  you can't fix people .  and though in various aspects reign over me is conventionally hollywood ,  that message isn't .   this story is not about charlie fineman  ( adam sandler )  ,  a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9/11 plane who's gone into a nearly psychotic state of ptss since .  it's about what meeting charlie does to alan johnson  ( don cheadle )  ,  a dentist in new york who was his roommate in dental school and ,  knowing about his tragedy ,  spots him on the street and reconnects .  charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter -- a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating manhattan traffic -- with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair .  the hair is sandler's chief prop to show he's deranged .  and the use of music as an escape must hit home to every ipod-wielding subway rider .   charlie is a disaster ,  but paradoxically alan ,  stuck with a controlling wife  ( jada pinkett smith )  ,  soon begins to envy him .  charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund  ( insurance money from the tragedy )  ,  and starts dragging alan off to  " hang out ,  "   " eat chinese ,  "  buy records ,  or watch a mel brooks marathon at a rep house .  charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady ,  redoing the kitchen over and over ,  collecting old vinyl of springsteen ,  the who ,  etc .  ,  and playing a video game called shadow of the collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room .   charlie's in-laws are deeply concerned about him ,  but also somehow resentful ,  as we learn later .  alan has a new patient who is propositioning him .  charlie's desperation makes us see alan's .  trying to help charlie partly permits alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of them .   cheadle and sandler make an odd couple ,  but that doesn't matter ,  because it's convincing that they might both need each other .  charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family ,  because to escape his loss ,  he is pretending he never had one .  and so what if as a roommate charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste  ( no motown )  ?  alan wants an escape from his tidy ,  emasculating life .  he's under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners ,  who lord it over him though it's he who set up the practice .  they're white ,  by the way ,  and he's black .   there's also the lascivious patient from hell ,  who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices ,  but starts looking different when charlie comes by and notices she's a babe .  his libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute .  he's also drawn to the breasts of liv tyler ,  a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat charlie when he admits he might need help .   sandler's mad scenes are a little too theatrical ,  as are a lot of the plot devices  ( in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point )  ,  but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching .   charlie's not just delusional and sad ,  but dangerous and violent ,  and all these efforts to help him start to backfire .  the movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people can't be made right .  this is an interesting movie -- sometimes a touching one -- and it's the first time 9/11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering .  but there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times ,  many of the people are too broadly drawn ,  and the overly grand hollywood interiors have dreadful décor ;  only the manhattan streets look real .  there's a courtroom scene that is preposterous ,  and donald sutherland is a judge who's too good to be true .  alan's family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call .  and yet this is worth watching for the acting -- the control and subtlety of cheadle ,  and sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in p . t .  anderson's 2002 punch-drunk love ,  though that's clearly a better movie ,  in fact a much better one . 
i didn't really go into  " reign over me "  knowing exactly what to expect either from the director or the story .  the plot was easy enough to understand ,  i suppose .  this guy's whole family died in 9/11 ,  and he shuts the world out of his life .  alright .  i didn't know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it ,  and it really doesn't on a very obvious level ,  so if you're scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours ,  i wouldn't worry about it .  i think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention  " september the eleventh "  .   overall ,  i was impressed .  it was a very moving picture .  the movie has a sense of humor ,  and it is very sharp ,  but it is definitely a drama where it counts .  i typically don't like to think that comedic actors are incapable of actually acting ,  but sometimes ,  let's be honest ,  they are .  adam sandler is definitely capable of it  ( and though i think so ,  you may disagree ,  jim carrey is also very well-rounded .  .  sometimes )  .  sandler's portrayal of charlie fineman took a character that on the surface seems completely unreal and makes it become absolutely believable .  i read many reviews that criticized the writing of alan johnson's  ( don cheadle in another excellent role ,  if not one that seems similar to a few of his more recent pictures ) wife ,  who is played well by jada pinkett smith ,  calling her static and dull ,  but that is completely untrue .   she has depth ,  but some of it gets hidden behind the main story ,  which does drift in and out of focus occasionally .   ( which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions done early in the movie ,  with a weird  " make everything out of focus "  fadeout .  after about the first 40 minutes ,  they aren't used anymore .  maybe it's significant for the characters outlook ,  artistically ,  or maybe they just realized how irritating it was .  )  the film gradually begins to reveal to us the point  ( one of several ,  but definitely the most explicit )  of the story ,  which is that sometimes people have to deal with grief in their own way .  maybe it seems unorthodox to us ,  maybe it seems downright unhealthy ,  but maybe what some people want more than anything is just to forget .  to just exist .  the films soundtrack was excellent ,  and it used music to pursue and amplify moods ,  rather than establish them ,  which gives credit to the actors and the writers .   the movie takes it's name from the song  " love ,  reign o'er me "  ,  off of the who's rock opera ,  quadrophenia .  the song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story ,  but it is used powerfully in the movie over the course of the climax ,  and at the very end .  the movie is paced well ,  and does not feel like it's dragging anywhere in it's length ,  which is a little over 2 hours .  if you can accept adam sandler's portrayal of this deeply heartbroken and broken down man ,  you will enjoy the movie .  you will become entangled in the story ,  and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it .  it is not the best movie of the year ,  and there's nothing groundbreaking or positively amazing in it ,  but it's a very enjoyable ,  watchable movie ,  all in all . 
in our household ,  we are enormous fans of a christmas carol and watch virtually every version each christmas ,  including the old 1938 reginald owen and the modern 1999 patrick stewart .  our overall favorite is the 1951 black & white classic ,  because alastair sim is ebeneezer scrooge and his conversion rings the truest .  however ,  this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely & entertaining story ,  quite faithful generally to dickens' novel .   ( see my comments on the other film adaptations ,  if interested )   first of all ,  george c .  scott can certainly seem pretty crotchety and doesn't make a bad scrooge .  i adore his sideburns ,  his long topcoat & hat .  he cuts the finest fashion figure of the lot ,  and quite a handsome gentleman .  however ,  sometimes it seems scott is enjoying his role as scrooge just a wee bit too much and not taking it quite as seriously as he ought !   this rendition has the best overall christmas atmosphere ,  hopeful and optimistic .  somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending .  filmed in the town of shrewsbury ,  england ,  it just seems somehow very british .  the film has a lovely musical score ,  with wonderful ,  lively caroling music throughout all the appropriate portions of the tale .  sometimes i could almost smell the chestnuts roasting and the pudding singing in the copper !    marley's anguished ghost  ( with his wonderful jaw dropping scene )  and the three spirits are all quite convincing .  christmas past is a lovely ethereal lady ,  christmas present wonderfully giant and jovial ,  christmas yet to come shrouded and foreboding as always .  however ,  i found scrooge's nephew ,  fred ,  a wee bit quiet & grim ,  not nearly as jolly & hearty as he should be .  i like the nephew's wife ,  whom they've named janet ,  with her lovely ,  sprightly period hairstyle .  instead of blind man's bluff ,  they've concocted a game called similes for the nephew's christmas dinner party ,  which is a cute little touch ,  scrooge getting right into the spirit of the thing .   the cratchits and their somewhat meagre  ( though much appreciated )  christmas dinner are well depicted ,  with bob  ( david warner )  suitably sympathetic and long-suffering in his miles of scarf .  mrs .  cratchit is charmingly portrayed by susannah york ,  who also starred with george c .  scott in the wonderful 1970 adaptation of jane eyre .  above all ,  this version has unquestionably the best tiny tim ,  not only an adorable & endearing little waif but sickly .  with those dark circles under his eyes ,  the frail wee thing looks unlikely to survive the hour !   this is a delightful & heartwarming version of the holiday classic .  with its festive atmosphere ,  it's sure to put you in the spirit of the season . 
let me say that i love adam sandler ,  watching reign over me i was paying close attention to his acting  when he raises his voice ,  i cant help but think of happy gilmore yelling at a golf ball ,  then i snap back as adam sandler sucks me in  reign over me is a great film ,  a film that comes off slow at first with you expecting emotion in every scene  don cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some truly great lines and is worthy of an oscar in any movie he does  adam sandler was amazing in so many ways not only was this his most dramatic/best acted film of his career .  but i can recall laughing out loud at many parts of this film  the supporting cast was great also with saffron burroughs and jada pinkett smith  i would highly recommend this movie its got tremendous acting beautiful shots of nyc great comedy great drama and a new found respect for adam sandler if you ever doubted him or a reassurance at how great don cheadle is
on september 11th ,  2001 ,  millions were killed ;  but 2 , 819 lives ended in an especially gruesome manner .  they were the victim of a plane hijacking by extremists whose sole mission was to destroy buildings ,  but more importantly ,  people .  this film takes an in-depth look at four people whose lives were cut short by this disastrous event and one man whose life was shattered by the loss of their lives .   charlie fineman  ( played by adam sandler )  ,  a former dentist living in new york ,  loses his wife and three children on september 11th as they were on their way to los angeles .  emotionally annihilated by the events ,  he eventually loses touch with everyone who reminds him of his former life ;  including his in-laws and his best friend  ( played ,  respectively ,  by robert klein ,  melinda dillon ,  and mike bender )  .  he goes into completely denial and does his best to forget about his former life .  this continues until he runs into his old college friend alan johnson  ( played by don cheadle )  who fineman doesn't seem to remember .  the two begin to catch up ,  but fineman believes johnson was sent by people from his former life to persuade him into finding help .  slowly ,  but surely ,  fineman regains his trust for johnson .   while all this is happening ,  alan johnson's life is going down the wrong path .  he is a self man  ( dentist )  who helps start a dental practice .  one day ,  a patient of his named donna remar  ( played by saffron burrows )  attempts to make a move on him ,  telling him that she would like to perform oral sex for him .  this is an unwelcome surprise to dr .  johnson since he is a married man with two children .  as he is coming home from work on a particular workday ,  he sees his old friend  ( fineman )  and tries to flag him down .  he is unsuccessful ,  but he gets another opportunity and persuades fineman to get a come of coffee with him to catch up ,  despite the fact that fineman doesn't know who he is .   one of the most interesting things about this movie is its use of music as a motif .  one of fineman's physiological crutches is music ,  particularly springsteen and other classic rock artists .  when fineman is asked to open up about his past or to talk about things he finds unpleasant ,  he puts on his earphones and drowns out the world with things his music .   when the film was over ,  i had me thinking :  how would i cope with the loss of my family ?  how would i deal with such a tragic events .  it's something we don't really think about too often .  we always think they'll be there and we often take them for granted ,  whether we intend to or not .  we usually realize how important they are when it's too late ;  and a blow like that can destroy someone physically ,  emotionally ,  and physiologically .  i really don't know how i would be able to deal with something like that .  would i face the problem head on ,  cope ,  and move on with my life or would i just put my headphones on and block the world ? 
most people ,  especially young people ,  may not understand this film .  it looks like a story of loss ,  when it is actually a story about being alone .  some people may never feel loneliness at this level .   cheadles character johnson reflected the total opposite of sandlers character fineman .  where johnson felt trapped by his blessings ,  fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective .  jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and sandler pulls tears .  cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for sandler .   i see oscars somewhere here .  a very fine film .  if you have ever lost and felt alone ,  this film will assure you that you're not alone .   jerry
reign over me  ( 2007 )  *** adam sandler ,  don cheadle ,  jada pinkett-smith ,  liv tyler ,  saffron burrows ,  donald sutherland ,  robert klein ,  melinda dillon ,  mike binder ,  jonathan banks ,  rae allen ,  paula newsome .  at times affecting and at times middling dramedy about a thoroughly depressed man who lost his family on 9/11  ( sandler in his best role since  " punch-drunk love "  )  who winds up re-united with his old college roommate and friend  ( cheadle continuing to do impressive work with every role to date )  ,  a well-to-do dentist who seems to have it all  family ,  wealth ,  happiness  but really sees an ally in freedom with his troubled friend's own personal life offerings .  written and directed by binder  ( who co-stars as sandler's former-best friend and acting accountant )  with equal parts humor and genuine heartache the film works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls into an almost movie-of-the-week treacle with to tidy a solution to the matters at hand . 
as someone who has never condescended adam sandler in terms of talent ,  as is done to him and many comic actors like him ,  i walked in to reign over me expecting a great film ,  not simply because of his presence in the movie but because i thought that it looked very good overall .  even someone who already thought that sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing here that i was surprised at how fantastic he is in it .  he will make you weep ,  especially in his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue .  what's amazing about his role is that it's a character it's hard to say we've seen before .  we've seen many emotionally scarred characters ,  many mentally retarded people ,  many loners ,  many passionate self-centered artists ,  but sandler's charlie fineman is none of these .  he may have a taste of each of them in some ways ,  but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual .  it's a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be tugged every which way by someone whose problems ,  mindset ,  and provocations are completely different from most characters like him .   don cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level .  he is every man .  he is the most normal possible person in the world ,  so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his either ,  or at least any that are played the way he plays alan johnson ,  whose name is even found on the assembly line .  cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny ,  jolting ,  smart ,  and stupid the way so many normal people are .   the rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who've hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colorful roles .  jada pinkett-smith is the overly refined upper middle class wife ,  donald sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge ,  robert klein is sandler's desensitized father-in-law .   mike binder's script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its guises .  it's much more subtle than ,  say ,  babel ,  and has a much more close-to-home ideal .   the camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style .  this film struck me as sort of a sendback to the kitchen-sink style of the 1970s .  cinematography was grainy and unfastened ,  but that was its charm .  it wasn't about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that would've diluted its stories with such .   the music ,  which plays a major role in the film ,  and its title ,  is very powerful .  near the beginning ,  you feel like you're in for another about schmidt or little miss sunshine sort of soundtrack ,  but you soon realize you're in for more than that .  in fact ,  the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes .   reign over me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself .  it goes to show that even the director of blankman is capable of wonders . 
time and time again ,  it seems that the comedic actors of hollywood are surprising me with their talents as dramatic performers :  first it was robin williams {'one hour photo  ( 2002 ) '} ,  then it was jim carrey {'eternal sunshine  ( 2004 ) ' being one example} ,  then will ferrell {'stranger than fiction  ( 2006 ) '} and now adam sandler .  yes ,  that's absolutely right :  the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless ,  goofball comedies {i'm not complaining ;  i've always been a fan} has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud .  of course ,  some readers may be wondering whatever happened to 'punch-drunk love  ( 2002 )  , ' but i can only assure you that it's a film i'm currently taking measures to see as soon as possible ,  since i've heard it's terrific .  my first film from director mike binder ,  'reign over me , ' is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship .  though it does occasionally stray into all-too-familiar territory ,  the somewhat predictable storyline proves surprisingly deep and moving ,  with both sandler and don cheadle giving memorable performances .   alan johnson  ( cheadle )  is a successful dentist with a good family ,  though he finds himself unable to communicate adequately with his wife  ( jada pinkett smith )  and so his marriage is a little shaky .  charlie fineman  ( adam sandler )  is alan's ex-college roommate ,  a man who lost his entire family in the terrorist attacks of september 11 ,  2001 ,  and who is still confronting his overwhelming feelings of grief .  a disheveled figure with messy hair and downcast eyes {often likened in appearance to bob dylan} ,  charlie has abandoned his career in dentistry ,  and spends his time in solitude :  listening to music with headphones that cut out all sound from the outside world ,  driving around manhattan in his motorised scooter ,  immersing himself in fantastical video games and repeatedly redecorating his apartment kitchen in accordance with his deceased wife's final wishes .  when alan and charlie meet for the first time in years ,  the latter doesn't even recognise an old friend ,  having completely abandoned any memories prior to his life-crippling experience .  indeed ,  at first he doesn't even acknowledge the existence of his family ,  and abruptly loses his temper whenever anybody suggests that he seek counselling .   initially ,  it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the september 11 attacks as a storytelling device .  afterall ,  wouldn't it be just as devastating if charlie's family had died in an ordinary ,  everyday car accident ?  however ,  if you consider that the director's intention was to demonstrate the enormous pain caused to ordinary citizens by the tragedy ,  then 'reign over me' does a very good job .  it's easy to get so caught up in meaningless statistics that you neglect the emotional costs of the terrorist attacks ;  this is the first 9/11-orientated film i've seen that truly dealt with the suffering of those who weren't even involved ,  whose only anguish was caused through losing those whom they loved .  adam sandler shows surprising range in a difficult role ,  one which would have crumbled to pieces had he not been up to the task .  snapping instantly between cheerfulness ,  anger and depression ,  charlie fineman is a man with whom we can deeply sympathise ,  a hollow soul who ,  thanks to the companionship of an old friend ,  can finally glimpse light at the end of a dark ,  bleak tunnel . 
there may be spoilers !   charlie fineman  ( adam sandler )  ,  who lost his family in a tragedy ,   ( the terrorist attacks of sept .  11 )  ,  still grieves over their deaths .  he runs into his former college roommate ,  alan johnson  ( don cheadle )  ,  and the two rekindle their friendship .  alan vows to help his old friend come to terms with the terrible loss .  this is a simplification of the basic story of reign over me .    this movie is ,  however ,  a story of how fate intercedes in our lives when we ourselves may be powerless do any thing about our own states of being .  alan is stuck in a life that he knows is no longer fulfilling .  he feels friendless and out of touch with his own reality .  he is unable to communicate with his wife and his associates at work .  he can't express his feelings and as a result feels lost and distant from his own world .  he chances upon charlie on the streets of manhattan while driving from his job .  eventually he meets and discovers that charlie ,   ( who originally does not remember alan )  ,  is living in a false reality of his own .  charlie has gone back to a time in his life when he had no family .  he lives as if he were still a student playing in a rock band ,  collecting vinyl records of the 60s and 70s bands ,  and playing video games .  he has escaped to a better and safer time in his life where there are no bad guys and he has a lot less to lose .  everyone in this movie is affected in some way by the tragedy that has affected charlie and his remission to a formerly different and better  (  ?  )  place .  his landlady is his protector and great enabler .  his in-laws are subtracted from his life because they would take him back to the reality that his family is now gone from his life .  and alan is most affected by him because alan wants to ,   ( in at first a selfish desire to escape from his own reality )  to be with charlie as a means to subtract himself from his own stifled reality and then he wants to find a way to help charlie begin to recover from his self-induced guilt and denial of loss .  it is through this relationship that not only is charlie able to begin to heal himself but that alan ,  in fact ,  learns to communicate and sate his true desires with his associates at work and ,  eventually ,  is able to admit to his wife he has not been able to communicate his real feelings to her but that he strongly wants to because he does love her .  it is in fact a poignant moment in the film when the stuff has hit the fan and charlie is being confronted with the reality of being put away that he and alan are talking about the situation together over  " chinese "  that charlie states that he is in fact worried about alan and not himself .    this movie will ,  if you let it ,  take you through a river of emotions and leave you thinking .  it will have you laughing at how charlie uses his words ,  like people really do in everyday life ,  to make a comical statement of fact about a real situation .  it will leave you on the verge of tears ,   ( in my case actual tears )  ,  when charlie confronts his grief and begins to come to grips with his tremendous loss .  and that in fact the tragic reality is his guilt and loss has really never left him and he dealt with it in the only way he knew :  denial .  it will make you curse at the cold ,  unthinking actions of a young prosecutor trying to win his  " case "  ,   ( as i actually did at charlie's hearing !  )  and it will make you smile at the commonsense of a old and wise ,  stern judge ,   ( donald sutherland who is great at his short distinct role and gives the best performance of a wise ,  stern person in the legal profession since wilford brimley played an assistant attorney general in absence of malice .  )   this movie was also amazing to me for a few other reasons :   ( 1 )  i never looked at my watch once during the showing of the film .  which means it had me from the beginning to the end ,   ( 2 )  although the cast was interracial ,  this fact was not important to the playing out of the roles of the characters in the film .  race was a non-factor to the performance of the roles in this movie .  amazing people can actually interact with out this fact being brought out !  and  ( 3 )  the only real reference to 9/11 is when charlie's financial attorney refers to the tragedy of charlie's loss as  " what charlie had become on 9/12 "  .  time will be the true test of how this movie will stand out in the future but if the purpose of a movie is not to just entertain but to make one think and have that movie stay with you long after you leave the theatre then reign over me succeeded phenomenally as far as i am concerned .  i have not yet forgotten this wonderful thought provoking film and i will wait impatiently for the day i can purchase it as a dvd . 
in new york ,  the family man dentist alan johnson  ( don cheadle )  meets his former roommate and friend charlie fineman  ( adam sandler )  by chance on the street .  charlie became a lonely and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic september 11th while alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife .  alan reties his friendship with charlie and they become close to each other .  alan tries to fix charlie's life ,  sending him to the psychologist angela oakhurst  ( liv tyler )  ,  but charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is send to court .    " reign over me "  is a good drama about loss ,  friendship ,  family and loneliness .  the september 11th is irrelevant to the plot ;  it could be a car accident ,  a fire or any other tragedy ,  as well as the sexual harassment of donna remar ,  played by the gorgeous saffron burrows ,  to alan .  but the family drama works ,  supported by the great performances of adam sandler and don cheadle .  liv tyler is quite impossible to be recognized ,  i do not know whether she is using excessive make-up to look older ,  but her face is weird .  my vote is seven .   title  ( brazil )  :   " reine sobre mim "   (  " reign over me "  ) 
reign over me is a success due to the powerful work by adam sandler and don cheadle .  while comedic actors going dramatic has been seen as somewhat of a distraction ,  sandler is no stranger to playing more serious roles .  most of the characters he portrays have an unstable temperament and a vulnerability that can burst at any moment .  he might even be typecast for characters with such hidden anger problems .  however ,  this performance has some considerable dramatic weight ,  unlike his roles in less comedic fare like punch-drunk love and spanglish .   in the film ,  alan johnson  ( cheadle )  runs into his old college roommate ,  charlie finerman  ( sandler )  ,  whom he hasn't seen in several years .  five years before ,  charlie suffered the overwhelming loss of his wife and three daughters in a plane crash .  charlie barely even recognizes cheadle's character due to the repression of his memories and consequent reclusive childish lifestyle since the accident .  it isn't until alan persists in engaging him in conversation that charlie remembers who he is .  their renewed relationship that follows will allow finerman to have a friend who doesn't speak about his loss ,  eventually enabling him to confront the thoughts and feelings he has suppressed on his own terms .   though writer-director mike binder doesn't show much sense of an individual style and some of his shots and transitions are a bit awkward ,  he does have a knack of getting decent to great performances from his actors while being a talented and funny writer .  he shot this film with a digital camera ,  as more and more filmmakers are doing today ,  enabling the crew to shoot the night scenes with limited lighting .  this kept the colorful backgrounds of new york city in focus ,  but resulted in creating frequent digital grain ,  which resembles blue specks scattered and moving on the screen .   almost every main character in reign over me gives a great performance .  jada-pinkett smith and especially liv tyler are memorable in their respective roles as a frustrated wife to cheadle's character and a psychiatrist .  however ,  it is sandler and cheadle that give some of their finest work to date .  they completely owned this movie .  sandler actually plays a character that doesn't outwardly resemble or act like himself at all ,  partially credited to his bob dylan-esquire wig .  though cheadle's character has more screen time than sandler ,  they both should be considered to be leading roles ,  as they equally support and help each other throughout the film .   music also plays a great part in this film ,  especially the title song  " reign over me ,  "  or  " love ,  reign o'er me "  by the who ,  and later covered by pearl jam .  in one of the most powerful moments of the film ,  binder shows sandler using music to shut out his feelings and memories ,  but this particular song provokes such intense emotion that rather than diminishing his anger ,  it incites his emotions .  all an all ,  reign over me is an enjoyable ,  sad ,  yet many times funny film ,  driven by its amazing leading performances . 
the feel of this movie was amazing .  adam sandler's performance was very inspiring .  as he played a very rattled and fragile character ,  he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role .  his character was really interesting .  i can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as sandler made me .  for someone who plays primarily comedy roles ,  he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input .  i especially loved the scene in which adam and don's characters rode the motorized scooter around the city .  i familiarized with the moment ,  because it seemed like don was witnessing one thing adam does to get away from it all .  with his video games ,  music ,  and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past ,  riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts .  this movie is definitely worth the watch .

let me start by saying at the young age of 34 i was suddenly widowed .  i was devastated as he was not sick--- he died unexpectedly basically of a coronary--- his carotids blew out-- he died behind our house .  there was a lot of speculation from police ,  cause he fell on something and it bashed his head in .  i was a suspect for murder until the autopsy came back .    my children were as traumatized as i was ,  so in love with a good father figure as he .  i had three small children ,  no education ,  no financial support .  i took it very ,  very hard .    within two years my in-laws attacked me verbally ,  physically ,  emotionally and spiritually demanding i grieve not in front of the children ,  and put on masks and showed people what they wanted to see ,  not show them my pain during holidays .  .  .  nobody stood up for me and my choice to sit out one holiday ,  except of course ,  the grief therapist i was seeing that had advised me to follow my heart and soul .  my in-laws didn't get it !  it changed forever my relationship with them ,  and i have never been back for a holiday .  this is only one example of how my grief was disrespected !  my own  ( new )  husband has seen me fall apart talking about the trauma when i shared from my soul .  i collapse ,  can not breathe ,  hyperventilate ,  and generally am defunct for a few days if i even try to convey the hidden pain .    now about this movie .  .  .   today ,  my soul was stirred ,  my heart broken .  my fears and pain re-surfaced from the real demons this movie presents ;  how one grieves compared to how others expect us too and the demons within .  adam sandler portrayed perfectly the horrendous agony you face ,  overcome and most of all ,  work through on your own time !  this movie dredged up all the pain that i have tried over the years to deal with .  you see ,  when something harms your soul so profoundly ,  so deep that utterances are all that come from your mouth in moments of thinking ,  you can not deal with it without wishing you were dead and walking through life ,  in a dead state .    the bible has a scripture ,  romans 8 : 26 that i have clung to ,  that when my mouth and soul know not what to pray for ,  that god's holy spirit carries that agony to the feet of god-- i need not speak .  sandler portrayed that to perfection !    there is a scene where he has been hauled into a court hearing ,  for mental health commitment purposes ,  and he goes back in to face his in-laws---  ( familiar to me ) --- and he tells them the stunning truths that he has been possessed by ,  per se ,  that he can't get over .  it's a profoundly strong ,  and mighty performance .  i started bawling and had a hard time after wards getting up to walk out from the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so .  my son was with me and saw it first hand ,  my precise motions while trying to hold it all together ;  a lesson for him ,  my youngest who barely remembers his daddy .  it's been 13 years for me but this movie brought me back to the moment of losing my in-laws forever when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my surrendering to their desires ,  instead of respect to my own .    i write this ,  so that if you are a griever ,  you are prepared for this movie ,  but recommend it highly in the 1000 star performance sandler gave .    if you are not yet a griever ,  please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief ,  letting them find peace in their own time !  sometimes ,  the soul can not utter the words to convey our pain .    go see this movie with tissues and not without preparing to take it in .  .  .  to your soul ! 
reign over me  ( titled after the who song )  is a movie that is sure to bring a tear to almost everyone's eye .  it was a moving story of a guy  ( sandler )  that lost his family in the 9-11 world trade center attacks .  years later ,  he runs into an old college roommate  ( cheadle )  that he doesn't even recognize due to the post-dramatic stress ensued by the loss of his family .  the two rekindle their old friendship and cheadle's character ,  johnson ,  realizes that he must get sandler's character ,  fineman ,  some help before it's too late .   this was the first movie that has made me cry in a long time .  it's completely worth watching and after seeing it ,  i'm positive the viewer will appreciate his or her family much more . 
greetings again from the darkness .  how rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain .  adam sandler stars as charlie ,  a man who lost his family in the 9/11 tragedy ,  and has since lost his career ,  his reason to live and arguably ,  his sanity .  don cheadle co-stars as sandler's former dental school roommate who appears to have the perfect life  ( that sandler apparently had prior to 9/11 )  .   of course the parallels in these men's lives are obvious ,  but it is actually refreshing to see men's feelings on display in a movie  .  .  .  feelings other than lust and revenge ,  that is .  watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt .  writer/director mike binder  (  " the upside of anger "  ,  and sandler's accountant in this film )  really brings a different look and feel to the film .  some of the scenes don't work as well as others ,  but overall it is well written and solidly directed .   sandler and cheadle are both excellent .  sandler's character reminds a bit of his fine performance in  " punch drunk love "  ,  but here he brings much more depth .  cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries  .  .  .  just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle .   support work is excellent by jada pinkett smith  ( as cheadle's wife )  ,  liv tyler  ( as a very patient psychiatrist )  ,  saffron burrows  ( in an oddly appealing role )  ,  donald sutherland as an irritated judge and melinda dillon and robert klein as sandler's in-laws .   the film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined .  in addition to the interesting story and some great shots of nyc ,  you have to love any film that features vocals from chrissy hynde ,  bruce springsteen and roger daltrey  .  .  .  as well as eddie vedder impersonating daltrey .  not exactly a chipper upbeat film ,  but it is a quality film with an unusual story . 
this movie was amazing ,  it is the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than look at other movies by actor you look at other movies by director/ writer .  sandler did a good job working a character outside of his comfort zone and the always good cheadle did a great job too .  this movie is great for a mature intelligent audience .  the acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by the writing and directing of the film .  this film focuses on the real americans ,  the past generation ,  no stereotypes or racism just people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life .  this film is about loss and coping .  instead of picking on psychiatry ,  it defines it ,  not as someone who heals you magically ,  but rather through the necessity of talking out your feeling to an impartial someone you can trust will not judge you ,  but rather will guide you though your thoughts .  this movie is all round amazing ! 
love hurts .  that ,  i think ,  is the main message mike binder's newest film reign over me brings across .  whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant ,  or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years ,  or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world ,  love hurts .  the great thing about this film ,  however ,  is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go ,  but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future .  no one in this drama is perfect ;  they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they can't free themselves from alone .  there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe ,  but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character-based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead .  what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how 9-11 effected us all ,  ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret .   this is a new career performance for adam sandler .  i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish ,  pent-up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically .  the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor ,  but also can be used to show a repressed man ,  shy and shutout to the world around hima man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell .  anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punch-drunk love and mike binder has taken it one step further .  sandler plays former dentist charlie fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on 9-11 .  that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result ,  he became reclusive and started to believe he couldn't remember anything that happened before that day .  he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him ,  those that love him ,  try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds .  always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family ,  he goes through life with his ipod and headphones ,  shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember .   reign over me is not about charlie fineman though ,  it is about dentist and family man alan johnson .  a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony ,  johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does .  played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle ,  johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life .  he has no friends and when he sees charlie ,  by chance ,  one day ,  his life evolves into something he hasn't felt in 15 years .  he revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family .  cheadle's character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and sandler's doesn't mind because all that was before he met his wife .  the two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives .  once they begin opening up though ,  it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the façade they have created for themselves .   the supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads .  jada pinkett smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely ,  but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true .  liv tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist ,  but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting ,  perfect casting .  the many small cameos are also effective ,  even writer/director mike binder's role as sandler's old best friend and accountant ,   ( my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere ,  considering it is his film )  .  last but not least is the beautiful saffron burrows .  she is a great actress and plays the love- crushed divorcée trying to put her life back together wonderfully .  a role that seems comic relief at first ,  but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come .   binder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies i have seen in a long time .  the direction is almost flawless ,   ( the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore/ background really annoyed me in the beginning )  ,  the acting superb ,  and the story true to itself ,  never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion .  even the music was fantastic and used to enhance ,  not to lead us emotionally ,   ( why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did binder feel the need to use the inferior eddie veddar remake for the end ,  i don't know ,  but it did unfortunately stick out for me )  .  reign over me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable ,  it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope . 
i saw this at a screening last night too .  i was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what i expected .  not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion .   i won't bother rehashing the plot too much because i think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better .  but i will say that adam sandler's performance was really refreshing and real .  he was funny ,  and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies .  don cheadle was believable as always .   this movie isn't funny like borat or billy madison but it has a good pace about it .  i'd say 90% of the audience laughed for most of the film .  midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together .   i also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend/white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves . 
this film screened last night at austin's paramount theater as part of the sxsw film festival .  we were graced with the presence of director mike binder and stars adam sandler and don cheadle who took audience questions after the film .  it is a remarkable and powerful film about what it is like to lose yourself and begin to find your way back .  the performances are phenomenal and the story manages to be both tragic and funny in a way that is all too rare .   ( the trailer for the film tries a little too hard to emphasize the comedic aspects .  )   this is a breakout role for adam sandler .  while he has begun to transition to more dramatic roles with punch-drunk love and spanglish ,  this role is a significant step forward for him as a dramatic actor .  he deserves an oscar nomination as he continues down to transition to more dramatic roles as tom hanks did and jim carrey is also doing .  in this role ,  he seemed to be trying to channel dustin hoffman in rain man .  although playing an autistic man is certainly very different than sandler's traumatized character ,  both characters for different reasons are trapped in their own worlds of child-like isolation and confusion .   don cheadle's performance is less surprising ,  but just as good .  after hotel rwanda and crash ,  we've come to expect remarkable nuanced performances from cheadle .  he has the qualities of sincerity and honesty that comes through in this role .  but he ,  too ,  is also broken and struggling if not in the such profound ways as sandler's character .  cheadle is struggling with difficulties in both his marriage and in his professional life as a dentist .  together the characters played by cheadle and sandler struggle to heal each other in the way that true friends often do  ( in a way that reminds me of matt damon and robin williams in good will hunting )  .  they are both searching for that part of the themselves that they have lost and trying to find again .   reign over me is one of the best major studio films to be released this year .  the soundtrack ,  which is almost another character in the plot is wonderful .  the filming in the streets of new york - a city that suffered a great tragedy and has also had to heal itself - is also quite beautiful .  the supporting roles by jada pinkett smith ,  liv tyler ,  saffron burrows  ( in a very odd role )  ,  donald sutherland ,  and mike binder himself are all quite good .   writer/director mike binder has really delivered a story that so many will be able to connect with on numerous levels .  this is a story about grief ,  family ,  healing ,  male friendship ,  mental health ,  and the meaning of love .  reign over me does not disappoint .  the film is almost hypnotic as it draws you into the lives of its characters .  hollywood would have a much better reputation if it made more character-driven charming films like reign over me . 
it's not very often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh ,  and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears .  many movies try to do this ,  but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film did .  adam sandler practically drags you in with his heated and often violent outbursts ,  but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past isn't pulling him down .  i'm not going to ruin anything ,  but there is one scene in particular that should have your eyes watering and lip quivering .  even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie .  don cheadle gives another great performance ,  but is out-shined by sandler .  liv tyler and jada pinkett smith give solid performances ,  but nothing in the line of the two leading roles .  sandler's humor is still present ,  which actually saved this film from being border-line depressing .  there are several laughs to be had ,  but don't think you will stay there long ,  because it gets serious again without much warning .   i could go on and on about how well this movie hit on just about every emotion the human body contains ,  but i will cut this one short .  i feel there is no need to tell you anything more .  do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie .  even if you have to wait until it comes out on dvd ,  it's 100% worth the time .  a deeply moving film sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face .  .  . unless of course .  .  . you are a heartless soul . 
i just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago ,  and i was very happy with the movie when i left it .  it's very intense ,  and the closest i've come to crying in a movie in quite some time .  that is a credit to adam sandler ,  who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels ,  and who probably deserves an oscar nom for it ,  were it not coming out so early in the year .  don cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to adam's disturbed .   there is some humor ,  but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments ,  as adam deals with his loss and don struggles to help him .  adam plays two levels very well .  .  .  when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable ,  but when he is ,  well ,  less stable he's powerful and dark .   i recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss . 
everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories  a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on christmas eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains .  so that he can avoid his partner's fate he is visited by three spirits who show him visions of christmases past ,  present and yet to come ,  so that he will hopefully see the error of his ways before it is too late .  a rather morbid tale one might think ,  but it is classic charles dickens ,  and also one of the most famous and popular christmas stories of all time .   to me this is the definitive version of dickens' timeless story ;  it's the one i always remember watching in school ,  and i remember being absolutely terrified by it !  the ghost of jacob marley ,  the final scene with the ghost of christmas present under the bridge ,  and the ghost of christmas yet-to-come especially i found very frightening .  how on earth did the film gain the 'u' certificate ?   ( for non-uk readers 'u' is the lowest classification ,  it means family friendly and children welcome ,  nothing to scare them etc .  .  .  this is certainly not the case though ,  as some smaller children will undoubtedly find the final segment positively terrifying with the grim reaper-like spectre of christmas future .   be that as it may ,  from the many versions of this classic story i have seen adapted for film ,  this is possibly the most faithful to the book .  most notably included is a segment rarely seen in film adaptations of the original text - that of the ghost of christmas present showing scrooge the two children hidden under his robe  ( you'd never get away with a scene like that nowadays !  )  .  the two children represent ignorance and need  ( although changed to want in this film )  .   criticisms for me however become apparent having watched it again with more objective and trained eyes ,  the main one of which being that george c .  scott's portrayal of scrooge seems simply not cold enough .  he laughs too much .  i don't want to use the word jolly because of course ebeneezer is anything but ,  but he does seem to be merely a grumpy old man ,  rather than the positively unkind ,  cold and uncaring man that he is in the book and other films .  patrick stewart portrayed him excellently in one of the most recent versions filmed ,  and michael caine ,  despite acting alongside the muppets ,  was positively cold .  further ,  the development of the character over the course of the film as he learns more about the error of his ways and grows towards redemption is unconvincing and appears inconsistent .  he appears to have changed little by the time he reaches the third spirit's final lesson .   but ignoring this one  ( albeit major )  quibble ,  it is still a spellbinding and ultimately heart-warming christmas tale ,  as all christmas films should be .  london of course looks like the perfect picturesque quaint snow-covered english town that many americans probably imagine it still is  ( the truth is that even then that london was grey and grimy  and any snow would never have been so white !  )  and everyone is so impeccably dressed too ,  even the poor people look rather dapper .  but of course it's a christmas film ,  so why shouldn't everything look nice ?  perfect holiday season viewing ;  coupled with copies of it's a wonderful life ,  miracle on 34th street and the snowman and you've got everything you need . 
this movie is proof that film noire is an enduring style ,  and extremely worthy of stay alive .  for me ,  it is he best example of film noire since chinatown .   it will ,  unfortunately ,  never get the recognition it deserves .  it was never promoted properly when it was first released and has had to build its cadre of fans through venues like vanguard cinema and word of mouth rental referrals .   i highly recommend that people looking for something more than mindless entertainment rent this movie and delved into its highly convoluted plot . 
i had never heard of this film prior to seeing it ,  i wondered if it was an independent film ,  and i was correct ,  but with a good cast i decided to chance it .  basically drifter michael williams  ( nicolas cage )  is in the town red rock ,  wyoming ,  looking for a job ,  and meeting bar owner wayne brown  ( pleasantville's j . t .  walsh )  he is given a large sum of money ,  mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife suzanne  ( lara flynn boyle )  .  he does not correct him ,  takes the money ,  and goes to warn suzanne ,  and after she makes him a counteroffer ,  he decides he needs to leave .  when wayne knows his real identity ,  he chases michael shooting a big gun ,  until he gets in a car with lyle from dallas  ( dennis hopper )  .  but things get complicated when michael realises lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for ,  and he makes a quick retreat .  he goes back to suzanne ,  and knowing they are both in danger ,  they plan to leave town together ,  and add another complication by falling for each other .  before they leave however ,  suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe .  of course things aren't going to go smoothly ,  and wayne and lyle catch up to them ,  and lyle forces them and now tied-up wayne to go and get the buried money .  in the end ,  lyle and wayne both get what they deserve ,  michael and suzanne do get on a moving train together ,  but it is obvious she cares more about the money ,  and she gets what she deserves too .  also starring craig reay as jim ,  vance johnson as mr .  johnson ,  timothy carhart as deputy matt greytack ,  dwight yoakam as truck driver and robert apel as howard .  the performances ,  apart from maybe a lame boyle ,  are all fine and dandy ,  and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller .  very good ! 
when this initially aired in 1984 ,  my wife and i taped it on our very first vhs recorder .  i still have that aging tape ,  which i try to watch annually .  it was the year my first child was born ,  and seeing a christmas carol in this incarnation brings back fond memories of happy times -- many hours of which were spent with this film playing in the background .  i finally broke down this year and ordered a dvd ,  which prompted me to take a moment to write this brief reaction to the movie .  charles dickens' story is captured in outstanding fashion here .  george c .  scott is absolutely amazing and totally believable as scrooge .  the supporting cast is equally spectacular .  this is ,  to my mind ,  a flawless production .  little details add much to the enjoyment .  the game  " similes "  scrooge's nephew and wife play with their party guests is a neat item .   ( i've since re-created it with my high school english students as a brief respite from class work !  )  honestly ,  i can think of few ways to entertain myself over the holidays i enjoy more than indulging in this cbs production ,  which was originally sponsored by ibm .   ( incidentally ,  it's fun to watch the old tape with the original ibm commercials  .  .  .  which show just how much computers have evolved in 21 years .  amazing how things have changed !  )  bottom line :  a christmas carol is a timeless story ,  and this rendition is a timeless classic .  enjoy  .  .  .  and god bless us ,  every one ! 
one thing i always liked about robert ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out ,  it goes in a completely different direction .  there are so many twists and turns in this film that i have a sore neck from watching .   one thing i also like about director john dahl  ( kill me again ,  rounders ,  unforgettable )  is that he can be depended upon to direct and ,  in this case ,  write  ( with his brother rick )  a good story .   now ,  add nick cage ,  dennis hopper ,  lara flynn boyle ,  and j . t .  walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected .  dahl seems to bring out the best in folks ,  and this will keep you interested ,  and guessing ,  until the very end . 
red rock west is one of those rare films that keeps you guessing the entire time as to what will happen next .  nicolas cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work .  dennis hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better .  look for a brief appearance by country singing star dwight yoakam .  this is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments .  what matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort ! 
like many of you i am a great fan of the real thing - the 1940s noir films - but red rock west was a real treat for all of us longing for the past .  the term 'neo-noir' has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact .  john dahl's film on the other hand ,  truly deserved to be described as such .  the casting is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with tay garnett or jacques tourneur .  the plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes .  james m .  cain would have appreciated it .  many contemporary films leave me wondering why they don't make them like they used to ,  and i'm not even that old .  movies such as red rock west give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past . 
this modern film noir with its off beat humour and dizzying succession of plot twists delivers a story full of surprises ,  dangerous characters and excellent entertainment from start to finish .  it's impossible not to empathise with the honest ,  unassuming hero or to be gripped by the ways in which he tries to navigate his way out of the terrible predicaments that he finds himself in ,  so all you can do is fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride .   the story of an ordinary guy who makes a poor decision and then finds that the repercussions propel him into an uncontrollable sequence of events from which he is unable to extricate himself is pure film noir .  the same is true of the themes of murder ,  deceit ,  corruption and duplicity which are pervasive throughout .  many of the familiar noir visual motifs are also present ,  such as the way in which cigarette smoke is lit ,  the rain soaked roads at night ,  the heavily shadowed interiors and the lines of shadow  ( created by louvred doors )  across people's faces .   michael williams  ( nicolas cage )  ,  an injured war veteran without money or a job ,  stops off at a bar in red rock ,  wyoming and is mistaken by the proprietor wayne brown  ( j t walsh )  for a hit man that he's arranged to employ to murder his wife suzanne  ( lara flynn boyle )  .  michael ,  a naturally reticent person ,  does nothing to disabuse wayne of his misapprehension ,  especially as he could use a job and at first doesn't realise what he'd be expected to do .  after having been told what his mission is and been given a $5 , 000 advance ,  he goes to see suzanne and warns her about wayne's plan .  she doesn't seem overly concerned about the danger she's in and offers michael double the fee wayne had offered ,  for him to eliminate her husband .   michael decides to take the money he'd received from both parties and leave town .  his plan fails however ,  when he accidentally drives into a man who is standing in the middle of the road and decides to take him to hospital to receive treatment for his injuries .  at the hospital ,  things get more complicated when it emerges that the patient is suzanne's lover and he has two bullets in his stomach .  this leads to the local law enforcement officers getting involved and the revelation that wayne is the sheriff !  !  from this point on ,  things get even more complicated and also decidedly more dangerous especially when the real hit man ,  lyle from dallas  ( dennis hopper )  arrives on the scene .    " red rock west "  has some great moments of suspense ,   ( an example of this is the scene in which michael makes his escape from wayne's bar )  and also some great performances from its very strong cast .  nicolas cage's expressions are extremely natural and convincing as he reacts to a variety of situations with anxiety ,  surprise or uncertainty and j t walsh is also particularly good as a deceptive character who's always concealing more than he's actually saying .  dennis hopper is intensely threatening as the vicious contract killer  ( a role he plays with great gusto )  and lara flynn boyle looks suitably cold and calculating as the femme fatale .  dwight yoakam also provides some good support and moments of humour in his cameo role as a no nonsense truck driver .   incredibly ,   " red rock west "  was originally destined to be denied a general cinema release but has justifiably emerged from its modest beginnings to eventually be recognised as the great movie that it really is . 
before nicholas cage was a big action star ,  he was a great actor .  this lesser-known movie is where cage gives one of his best performances .   " red rock west "  was a low-budget ,  almost un-known film ,  but is one of my favorite movies of all time .  i discovered it walking down the video store aisle ,  and wanted to see cage and hopper  ( who also is great in the movie )  appear together .  go get this one ,  and i'm sure you won't be disappointed . 
this is a 'sleeper' .  it defines nicholas cage .  the plot is intricate and totally absorbing .  the ending will blow you away .   see it whenever you have the opportunity . 
a surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad .  a great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot overseen by a twin peaks-ish influence in director dahl .  nicholas cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrayal of a man in a bind looking for the right thing to do .  j . t .  walsh  ( rip to a great actor )  is always a wonderful villain ,  as is dennis hopper .  it's such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the biz .  i'm sure he has his followers ,  though .  in all ,  this is a great film that shows you that you don't need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining film . 
dahl seems to have been under the influence of wenders' the american friend .  innocent nick cage gets recruited for a hit .  dennis hopper plays a real hit man .  lara flynn boyle is dangerous .  the hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself .  and small town america does not seem all that safer than the big city .  like it's predecessor mentioned above ,  this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable ,  but all lead to the cathartic self discovery . 
the more i watch nicholas cage ,  the more i appreciate him as an actor .  watching this movie now  ( in 2005 )  ,  i can see that it doesn't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s .  i don't really think it can be considered a film noir ,  but it is pretty dark at times ,  due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters .   typical performances from each of the three main actors ,  who all did a good job with their roles .  i thought ,  however ,  that hopper and boyle's characters were left undeveloped ,  as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it .  hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy .  the plot is really good ,  and although i found some parts to be very unrealistic ,  there were parts where i had to hand it to the director  ( i . e .  when he first sees the sheriff )  .  all in all ,  this movie is definitely worth watching .  ***1/2
a lovely old - fashioned thriller coming on like a cross between alfred hitchcock and david lynch ,  " red rock west "  follows the misadventures of injured veteran unemployed oil worker mr n . cage as his luck turns from bad to worse after he ends up with an empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in a one ute town in the back of beyond .  it has been established right from the start that mr cage might be down but he is not out , and he might be broke but he will not steal , not even in his present dire circumstances . consequently when he is mistaken by mr j . t .  walsh for the man he has commissioned to murder his wife , mr cage calls on the wife to warn her of her husband's intentions . in turn she , in the person of miss l . f . boyle ,  offers him even more money to murder mr walsh . mr cage decides to leave whilst he is still in front but as he is driving out of town he hits a man in the road . tempted as he might be to drive on , he takes the man to hospital , where it turns out he has been shot . mr cage is detained by the deputies who call the sheriff who turns out to be mr j . t . walsh .  events take a further complicated turn when , escaping from custody , mr . cage narrowly avoids being run over by the real hit-man on his way to fulfill his commission . about now you might be forgiven for thinking  " enough already "  , but as it happens on the screen it seems a completely logical turn of events , the narrative flow of the movie at this point seeming unstoppable .  mr d . hopper is comfortably cast as the hired killer , like mr cage a usmc veteran . this little piece of serendipity keeps mr cage alive long enough out-think the murderous trio and survive , a little more battered but still unbowed .  it is a tribute to everybody involved that what sounds on paper remarkably like a piece of nonsense is in fact a tense exceptionally well made picture with fine performances all round .   " red rock west "  is a movie - lover's movie . within five minutes you know you are going somewhere you've been before on plenty of occasions , but you'll be very happy during the trip . 
a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small wyoming town ,  leading to all kinds of complications .  cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can't escape the title town .  hopper does what he does best ,  playing a psycho known as  " lyle from dallas ,  "  the real hit man .  walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast .  the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns ,  and john's direction creates a terrific  " neo noir "  atmosphere .  witty and very entertaining ,  it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up . 
red rock west is one of those tight noir thrillers we rarely see anymore .  it's well paced ,  well acted and doesn't leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre .   nicolas cage stars as michael ,  an unemployed texas roughneck ,  desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to wyoming for potential employment .  he is honest to a fault ,  but always on the dark side of fate .   after failing to obtain gainful employment ,  michael stumbles into the red rock bar where the owner wayne  ( j . t . walsh )  mistakes him for a contract killer he summoned from dallas ,  hired to do in his lovely but lethal wife suzanne  ( lara flynn boyle )  .   wayne gives michael the necessary details and a down payment for the hit on the adulterous suzie .  with no intent on following through ,  michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn suzanne of her impending demise .  he also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits .   as fate would dictate ,  michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy .  while leaving in a violent rainstorm ,  he runs down suzannes lover .  of course michael being michael ,  he takes him to the local hospital where it's discovered that he's also been shot .   the sheriff is summoned and as luck would have it ,  wayne is also the local law .  michael manages to escape while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real  " lyle from dallas "  played with murderous glee by the quirky dennis hopper .  after discovering that they're fellow marines ,  lyle insists that michael join him for a drink at ,  where else ,  the red rock bar .  there wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and lyle are in hot pursuit of michael who falls willingly into suzannes waiting arms .   as the pace picks up we learn that wayne and suzanne are really wanted armed robbers ,  on the lam for a multi million dollar theft .  getting the money now becomes the films central focus with a series of betrayals ,  double crosses and murders .   the film was very well cast .  nicolas cage was typically low key ,  dennis hopper and lara flynn bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability .  the best performance was by the late j . t .  walsh who was menacing without appearing to be .  walsh was a great character actor who left us much too soon .   marc reshoskys photography utilized many unique angles which added to the suspense and plot development .  the film was further enhanced by john dahl's tight directorial style and morris chestnut's rapid fire editing . 
from the director of movies 'last seduction' and 'kill me again' ,  comes another movie in the noir style .  john dahl created a niche for himself by making movies on the themes of adultery ,  blackmailing in the early 90s .  though i did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction .  but nowadays mr dahl has resorted to directing television shows . its a shame since the man had talent .   ***spoilers** this is quite an impressive movie which revolves around a drifter cage )  that comes in to the town of wyoming for a job .  however he does not prove lucky and becomes mistaken for a hit-man from texas by bar owner j . t walsh .  he is given the task to kill his wife  ( boyle )  .  but cage decides to split after taking the upfront payment without doing it .  on the way out of town he accidentally hits a guy on the road ,  who he then takes back to the local hospital .  at that point cage coincidently meets walsh again ,  who also appears to be the local sheriff .  after that cage escapes from his clutches but meets in to the real hit-man that happens to be dennis hopper .   john dahl has co-written and directed this movie .  therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen .  the direction is of good standard ,  however while watching the movie i got a made for tv movie feeling .  there were too many close up frames .  however this does not deter the movie from being an enjoyable experience .  the movie had good pace and the structure was perfect .  dahl written the script with good duration of lenght .   cage portrayed the role as a drifter realistically ,  though to me his performance seemed somewhat restrained .  his facial expressions were on the mark .  lara flynn boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale .  her hairstyle was far out and can make any guy go on his knees .  hopper played his part well .  but i feel he was miscast for this role .  he did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit-man .  the role was not written keeping his personality in mind .   while viewing one will get deja vu of previous movies like 'the hot spot' and 'a perfect murder' .  due to the fact that some sub plots are similar .  overall if you are a fan of noir movies ,  then this one is for you .  worth recommending .  7/10
an excellent example of  " cowboy noir "  ,  as it's been called ,  in which unemployed michael  ( nicolas cage )  loses out on a job because he insists on being honest  ( he's got a bum leg )  .  with really nothing else he can do ,  he decides that for once he's going to lie .  when he walks into a bar ,  and the owner wayne  ( the late ,  great j . t .  walsh )  mistakes him for a hit-man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne  ( lara flynn boyle in fine form )  ,  michael plays along and accepts waynes' money .  *then* he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands' intentions ,  and accepts *her* money to get rid of wayne !  if that didn't complicate things enough ,  the real hit-man ,   " lyle from dallas "   ( dennis hopper ,  in a perfect role for him )  shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before .    " red rock west "  gets a lot out of the locations .  director john dahl ,  who co-wrote the script with his brother rick ,  was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes .  it's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation .  it's an appreciably dark and twist-laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt ,  have at least been morally compromised like michael .  the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness ;  even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing .  even if the writing isn't particularly  " logical or credible "  ,  the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in .   cage does a good job in the lead ,  but his co-stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed-motivated characters .  hopper ,  boyle ,  and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts .  timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs' deputies  ( in one especially good twist ,  walsh is also the local sheriff )  ,  and there's an entertaining cameo role for country & western star dwight yoakam ,  who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune .   it's quite a good little film worth checking out .  it moves forward at an impressive pace ,  and if nothing else is certainly never boring .   8/10
red rock west is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget .  all you need is a smart script ,  good actors and loads of atmosphere .  rrw delivers all these and more .   nic cage plays an ex-marine ,  injured in lebanon ,  who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an oilfield because of his bad knee .  he roles into red rock and is mistaken by bartender wayne  ( jt walsh ,  not quite as his most menacing-but still evil )  for a hit-man from texas .   he pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary .  only when he gets there ,  just to check her out .  she offers him double to kill wayne .  cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be .  but a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yo-yoing in and out of red rock ,  back and forth .  eventually this leads to a run-in with lyle from dallas  ( a cheeky and somehow sympathetic dennis hopper )  ,  the real hit-man from texas who offers to help without knowing he's making the plot more complicated .   rrw never had a big release ,  thus most of it's audience discovered it on video or on cable tv showings .  viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a tv movie but it's bigger than that .  the slick ,  slowly-timed direction ,  moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the dvd on a big hdtv .   the only weak point of the movie i can think of is lara flynn boyle's boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke-ish hairdo .  i certainly wouldn't fall for her but if you assume that nic cage's character is in to militant lesbians then you'll accept it nonetheless . 
what we have here is a damn good little nineties thriller that ,  while perhaps lacking in substance ,  still provides great entertainment throughout it's running time and overall does everything you could possibly want a film of this nature to do .  i saw this film principally because it was directed by john dahl - a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as the last seduction ,  rounders and roadkill .  i figured that if this film was up to standard of what i've already seen from the director ,  it would be well worth watching - and red rock west is certainly a film that dahl can be proud of .  the plot focuses on the overly moral michael ;  a man travelling across america looking for work .  he ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in red rock county - only catch is that the job is to murder a man's wife .  he's been mistaken for a killer named lyle ,  but instead of doing the job ;  he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a getaway .  however ,  his attempts to escape are unsuccessful and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real lyle turns up .  .  .   john dahl appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road ;  he did it three years earlier with kill me again ,  and again almost a decade on from this film with roadkill .  it's not hard to see why dahl chooses this sort of location ,  as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one .  dahl also provides his film with a 'film noir' like atmosphere ,  as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is plunged into is full of dark and mysterious characters .  the acting is largely very good ,  with nicholas cage doing an excellent job in the lead role ,  and getting a-class support from lara flynn boyle ,  j . t .  walsh and ,  of course ,  dennis hopper ;  who once again commands the screen with his over the top performance .  it has to be said that the second half of the film isn't as gripping as the first ,  but red rock west certainly is never boring and the way that dahl orchestrates the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it .  overall ,  red rock west is a film that you're unlikely to regret watching .  it's thrilling throughout ,  and you can't ask for much more than that ! 
as others have commented ,  i checked this out after siskel and ebert listed this as one of their top 10 movies of the year .  what a gift .  i then went out to buy it ,  just so that i could loan it out .   best quote ?  dwight yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone  ( cage )  is on top of his cab .  when cage peers down ,  he apologizes .   " i'm sorry if i scared you .  "  yoakum thrusts his pistol in cage's face with  " does this look like i'm scared ?  "  great bit of humor after an exciting  ( and temporary )  escape .   there really was a sense of fun to this .  the constant sighting of the  " welcome to red rock "  sign elicits a groan and a smiling head shake .  the music created a hunting ,  eerie quality to the film reminiscent of  " twin peaks "  .  unlike  " twin peaks "  ,  though ,  it doesn't spoil things by going too far into the outlandish ,  needing to  " top "  itself .   i admit watching the credits 15-20 times .  you see ,  they had yoakum's  " thousand miles from nowhere "   ( perfectly chosen )  playing as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor  .   .  with snow-capped mountains in the distance .  this was incredible ,  fluid framing .  further ,  i've never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film .  also ,  it totally fit the story . 
much to your presumable happiness fair readers ,  cage and hopper did meet and fortunately not in a lynch moviebecause red rock west is way better than any lynch movie  .  nicolas cage is a thirdrate actor ,  the porcelain babe is a surrogate femme fatal ,  only daddy hopper is as mean as ever  .  red rock west is ,  despite the trite cast ,  one of my favorite american thrillers ;  in a word ,  a thriller with some twists .   one notices mainly the gusto ,  the awesome pace ,  the thrills ,  the nice suspense ,  lara flynn boyle's cute tight small ass ,  cage's enviable physical shape  ( though undeniably ugly ,  with sharp ,  bird features ,  thick eyebrows and thin ,  rare hair ,  cage displayed a fine overall shape  )  ,  hopper's consummate routine ,  some moderately but truly funny moments ,  cage's play with his intended persona ,  hopper's rigid ,  psychopathic allure ,  lara's meanness ,  cage seems a roamer ,  the archetypal gloomy roamer of the noir cinema ,  hungry ,  tough if needed ,  naive ,  dirty ,  tired .  lara flynn boyle performs as the cold mean seductress ,  walsh as her heartless husband ,  and hopper as the lynchian hit-man he's already done before .   cage looks indeed rather groggy or dizzy or very confused and having a severe hangover .  but this might be his regular look . 
red rock west  ( 1993 )   nicolas cage gets embroiled in a deadly crime without at first knowing it ,  and the dominos lead to increasing peril ,  adventure and misadventure in the wild forlorn american west of the 1990s .  red rock west is often brutal and sometimes hilarious ,  and cage pulls off the mixture with his usual sardonic wit and wary ease .    is the plot over the top ?  yes .  is dennis hopper perfect as a crazed ,  almost likable killer ?  yes .  does cage stand a chance ?  well ,  you have to watch and see .  it never lets up ,  and it took me by surprise the first time i saw it .  on second viewing yesterday ,  i was surprised at how well it held up ,  how well constructed it was ,  and how macabre and funny it was at the same time .   director ron dahl  ( who also helped write )  is known more for his tv work ,  but with rounders and this film he shows a deft hand with sensational plots .  it's saved by its humor by the way ,  and by the caricatures .  the bar is sleazy ,  the cops questionable .  and don't miss a really inspired cameo by dwight yoakam as a truck driver . 
although george c .  scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent ,  he more than makes up for it with his over-the-top and larger-than-life interpretation of ebenezer scrooge .   particularly effective is when he confronts bob cratchit in his office at the movie's end .  as scott stands before a large window ,  sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him ;  all you can see is his silhouette .  augmented by scott's voice ,  a ponderous growl ,  the effect is galvanizing .  .  . much like marlon brando's first scene in apocalypse now .   " the horror ,  "  indeed !    however ,  as they say ,  the very thing that works for you can also work against you .  because scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie ,  it proves infectious .  to put it another way ,  the  " before "  scrooge is almost as charismatic as the  " after ,  "  even though he really shouldn't be .  it's what you might call the  " doctor smith "  effect ,  since jonathan harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies  ( stage and screen alike )  .   actually ,  i myself don't consider scott's glib rage a liability .  but other  " christmas carol "  purists might .  see the film and judge for yourselves . 
this movie started me on a nick cage kick .  it is a story full of twists and turns- a movie of motives and moves .  of ,  course ,  dennis hopper was a ham ,  but j . t .  walsh and laura flyyn boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into their web .  everything about this movie is good - cinematography ,  story pace and most of all the end .  cage excels at what he does best- it's not to be an action hero but to be an everyman caught in the snares of life . 
okay ,  there are a ton of reviews here ,  what can i possibly add ?   i will try anyway .    the reason this is my favorite scrooge is because of everything .  the sets ,  outdoor locations ,  costumes are so beautiful and authentic .  the music is sweet .  the supporting cast is very well done .  one of my favorites is the narrator & nephew ,  played by roger rees .  his understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of christmas to me .  david warner is also a totally believable bob cratchit .  his is a difficult life ,  but he remains positive and dignified .    the best part of course- is george c .  scott as ebenezer scrooge .  some have said his portrayal too gruff .  i couldn't disagree more .  his exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh ,  weren't out of character .  he is a terribly disillusioned man who's heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth .    during the flashbacks ,  it's obvious that he isn't all gruff .  this is where we see that there is hope for him .  if he was totally gone ,  his partner marley would never have come for his sake in the first place .  and after all ,  we are none of us past hoping .  i think that is a huge part of what dickens was trying to say .  when scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer's with belle ,  you see him smile regretfully as he tells belle in the flashback that he will go through life  " with a grin on my face .  "  clive donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film .  sometimes they get left on the editing room floor .   and finally ,  his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy every time i see it .  his apology to his nephew fred ,  so sincere ,  so moving ,  it is the spirit not only of christmas ,  but of humanity itself .  the joy he brings to fred ,  to his wife are so apparent .  and the line that gets me every time ,   " god forgive me for the time i've wasted .  "    bravi tutti ! 
dennis hopper and jt walsh steal the show here .  cage and boyle are fine ,  but what gives this neo-noir its juice is hopper's creepy ,  violent character and jt walsh's sneakiness .   a drifter gets mistaken for a hit-man ,  and tries to make a little dough out of it ,  but gets in over his head .   i found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie ,  when cage walks into a trailer in wyoming to get drilling work ,  with the help of his buddy .  .  . and the opening scene in brokeback mountain ,  when the character does the same thing !  but that's another story .   dennis hopper is at his best here .  .  . cocky ,  one-step-ahead villainous ,  seething and explosively violent .  jt walsh  ( rip )  is also great as the man with a dark past ,  trying to live legitimately  ( well ,  almost )  .   there are only 4 real characters of note here ,  with the exception of the hard-working deputy in the town of red rock ,  wyoming .  the first twist hits early on ,  and from there it's a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town .  satisfying .  8 pts . 
i came home late one night and turned on the tv ,  to see siskel and ebert summarizing their picks of the week .  i didn't hear anything about  " red rock west "  ,  except two thumbs up and see it before it went away .  it wouldn't stay in theaters very long because of the distributor's money problems and lack of promotion ,  but they said it deserved better .   the next afternoon ,  i followed their advice .  they were right ,  it was some of the most fun i have ever had at the movies .  as some readers point out ,  there are a few plot holes and the last 10 minutes don't ever seem to end .  but it's well worth it ,  for the fine craftwork that went into the first hour .  it's the best role that i have ever seen for nicholas cage ,  but almost everybody seems perfectly cast .  dennis hopper goes almost over the top ,  which gets silly but reinforces how well everything else works .  the sets and the music contribute a great deal to almost every scene .   when i rented it later for my family ,  it didn't work as well .  the long scenes that built the tension in the theater were difficult to appreciate ,  with the distractions at home .  it deserves your full attention ;  turn off the phone ,  make sure you won't be disturbed ,  watch and listen to every scene ,  especially in the beginning . 
some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds .  this is one of those movies .  tracing it's roots back to  " double indemnity ,  "  and  " the postman always rings twice "  in the 40's - this was a great example of modern film noir in the 90's .  nick cage plays the  " down on his luck "  main character who gets entangled in a husband-wife murder plot - and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people ,  town ,  violence and threat of red rock west .  lots of twists and turns ,  great performances by cage ,  hopper and walsh ,  an hypnotic slide-guitar musical backdrop ,  and seamless directing make this a real joy .  favorite line :  when cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get-away car ,  shakes his head and says :   " f***in' story of my life .  " 
 " red rock west "  was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's with a superb script  ( by john and rick dahl )  that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film .  it was brilliantly directed by john dahl and featured a marvellous cast including nicolas cage ,  dennis hopper ,  lara flynn boyle and especially j .  t .  walsh  ( in a memorable performance )  making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed .  the film never had much publicity on release  ( in fact i first caught up with it on tv )  and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film is now slowly gaining a cult following .   nicolas cage is michael williams who is broke and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of red rock .  mistaken for a contract killer named lyle from dallas he is shocked to be offered $10 , 000 to murder the wife of bar owner wayne brown  ( the excellent j .  t .  walsh )  .  he plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn brown's wife suzanne  ( lara flynn boyle )  but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists ,  turns and surprises - and double dealings - that cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he can't drag himself out of !  then just to complicate matters even further the real lyle turns up to carry out the contract killing  ( played by everyone's favourite heavy dennis hopper )  .  when hopper discovers what has happened he goes after cage but no one could forsee the surprising events that follow .   some favourite lines from the film :   nicolas cage  ( to lara flynn boyle )  :   " i hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it's an awful lot of money "  .   j .  t .  walsh  ( to cage )  :   " michael williams .  well ,  michael ,  you're going to be spending some time with us till we get to the bottom of this "  .   boyle  ( to cage )  :   " you're not a killer ?  "  .  cage :   " that's right ,  no .  but the guy i'm supposed to be just rode into town so you gotta get out of here "  .   boyle  ( to cage )  :   " o . k .  how you're going to explain impersonating a hired killer and taking $10 , 000 from my husband ?  "  .   an extraordinarily entertaining little thriller  ( just 98 minutes )  with a storyline that never lets up and powerful acting by all the principals .  any film featuring j .  t .  walsh is o . k .  in my book and  " red rock west "  was one of his best .  how sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was cut tragically short by a heart attack in 1998 .  the most prolific period for  " film noir "  was without any doubt the forties but  " red rock west "  is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my  " top ten "  list of all time favourite films .  i look forward to more like this from director john dahl .  10/10 .  clive roberts .   
if you like plot turns ,  this is your movie .  it is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen next .  nothing is as it appears or ends as you think it will .  the characters are all gritty and engaging .  cage is at his best .  dennis hopper again shows his delightfully sinister side .  jt walsh is perfect in his last performance .  laura boyle sizzles .  dwight yoakum makes a film debut superbly in a cameo .  i categorize this movie as  " i am having a really ,  really ,  really bad day "  film .  not a slow minute in this film .  a real sleeper .  this movie is underrated and ,  sadly ,  overlooked . 
in any number of films ,  you can find nicholas cage as a strong ,  silent hero ,  dennis hopper as a homicidal maniac ,  lara flynn boyle as a vamp/tramp ,  and the late ,  lamented j . t .  walsh as the heavy .  these are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep ,  and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on cliche .  what a relief ,  therefore ,  that john dahl ,  a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action ,  directed this nuanced noirish thriller .  hopper manages to keep from going over the top ,  cage shows a little more depth than his usually-superficial action heroes ,  boyle is by turns sultry ,  innocent ,  and scheming ,  and one gets a sense of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character ,  wayne .  dahl's direction gives a sense of the emptiness of the big sky country where the story takes place while also being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled brow can indicate a radical change of plot in store .  the plot twists are top-notch ,  and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains .  it isn't often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their headlining superiors .  but with a director as smart as dahl ,  you shouldn't be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film .  an excellent movie . 
vaguely reminiscent of great 1940's westerns ,  like  " the treasure of the sierra madre "   ( 1948 )  ,   " red rock west "  is a story about conscience ,  greed ,  and betrayal .  michael  ( nicolas cage )  is a down and out ,  but honest ,  young man from texas who goes west in search of work and money .  he finds both ,  but not in the way he had expected .   the film's screenplay contains plenty of surprises and plot twists .  excellent cinematography ,  adroit film editing ,  and moody western music add tension and suspense .  the expansiveness of the big sky country provides a wonderful setting .  and the acting ranges from good to excellent ,  with great performances from dennis hopper and j . t .  walsh .  dwight yoakam's specially recorded country/western song provides the film with a strong finale .   correctly labeled as neo-noir ,   " red rock west "  strikes me as being something else ,  as well .  the plot is full of amazing coincidences and improbable timing ,  so much so that others may regard the screenplay as flawed .  ordinarily ,  i would agree .  in this case ,  however ,  when combined with the moody atmosphere ,  and the fact that the small town of red rock seems almost empty of normal daily life ,  the coincidences and unlikely timing suggest a story that ,  beyond  " noirish "  ,  is  .  .  .  surreal .  it's almost as if fate deliberately intervenes with improbable events so as to force michael to come to grips with himself .  from this point of view ,  the coincidences are not script flaws at all .  they are necessary plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who must confront his own demons  .  .  .  disguised as other characters .   all we need here is rod serling ,  in a postscript ,  explaining ,  in his always clearly enunciated voice ,  that  .  .  .  a young man ,  searching for himself ,  stops in a small ,  almost deserted town a thousand miles from nowhere .  it's his final layover in a journey to  .  .  .  the twilight zone . 
this is an excellent modern-day film noir .  .  .  .  " excellent "  in that it's interesting ,  start-to-finish .  there are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief .  .  .  .  . but i haven't found anyone who didn't get caught up in this story .  the movie has the right amount of action ,  suspense ,  plot twists and interesting characters .  in addition ,  it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar-based soundtrack .    i labeled this crime movie a  " film noir "  because it's gritty and the all the characters are no good .  even the only supposed-good guy ,  played by nicholas cage ,  gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he should't have .  he also does something at the end which isn't right ,  but i'm not going the spoil it by saying .  suffice to say ,  however ,  that the rest of the characters are so bad they make cage look good !   speaking of  " bad guys ,  "  does anyone do it better than dennis hopper ?  not many .  at least in the  " deranged "  category ,  he's tough to beat .  lara flynn boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons .  j . t .  walsh gives another great supporting performance ,  too .   this is one of those films that never got much publicity ,  but it should have .  you'll have fun watching this .  by the way ,  try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up ! 
this is a film i saw when it first came out ,  and which i have seen a few more times over the years .  it's always enjoyable .   one thing is that the comedy does not take sides :  it skewers labor and capitalists equally .  only sid seems outside the classic struggle ,  even though he's responsible for it .    spoiler warning :  do not read further if you haven't seen the film   this is a fantasy ,  though presented fairly plausibly .  ask yourself :  could someone support most of his or her weight in a single strand of fabric ?  it would cut through almost any support .   also ,  when cornered in an alley ,  sid uses a garbage can cover like a knight's shield .  cute symbolism .   someday ,  i'll get this on dvd . 
if the man in the white suit had been done in america ,  can't you see either danny kaye or jerry lewis trying on alec guinness's sidney stratton on for size ?   this is one of the best of alec guinness's films and certainly one of the best that ealing studios in the united kingdom ever turned out .  it's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new labour government and the society it was trying to build .  it's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree .   alec guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning ,  that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment .    he's a persistent cuss and he does succeed .  of course the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society .  in the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive ,  almost like peter lorre from m or orson welles in the stranger or even robert newton in oliver twist .    it's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films i've mentioned can be played for laughs .  poor guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent ,  but it glows like a neon sign .   other than guinness the best performances are from cecil parker as yet another pompous oaf ,  joan greenwood as his siren daughter and ernest thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the uk>   come to think of it ,  did paramount borrow that suit from ealing and give it to john travolta for saturday night fever ? 
ok .  i'm biased .  i live near shrewsbury in england ,  where this wonderful movie was filmed .  it still looks the same now .  i remember them filming here quite vividly ,  and the fake snow on the streets for days on end .  often ,  when i'm walking through shrewsbury i see a street or a house and it will remind me of this film .   george c .  scott's scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions .  his physical appearance isn't the typical miser .  scott's is big and imposing .  a man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferior .   we all know the story and the quotes .  the book is one of the most cherished works in the english language .  and i don't believe there are many cynics who would say that people aren't capable of change and redemption .  this film version portrays all of that quite beautifully .  george c .  scott may be american but he plays the part of the english miser with wonderful skill .   i love this movie .  if you haven't seen this version i would strongly urge that you do .  it's usually available for a very small amount of money .  .  .  or are you too mean ? 
what a wonderful movie ,  eligible for so many labels it never gets :  science fiction ,  film-noir ,  with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated ,  cultured audience .  .  .  .  . the kind of english language movie only done in pre-1960 england  ( and shown only in usa art movie houses when it first arrived )  ,  and never ,  ever done in the usa .   main characters in the man in the white suit ( 1951 )  starring sir alec guiness and joan greenwood routinely use polysyllabic ,  science reference words like  " polymer "  and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like  " long chain molecules "  and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him .   the man in the white suit  ( 1951 )  is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies which now  ( 2009 )  dominate world cinema ,  and certainly dominate major usa cinema .  .  .  .  .  .  . it's a carefully acted ,  intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated english actors  ( who play educated ,  accomplished people )  ,  and it's all done with comedy ,  charm ,  pathos ,  and sense of irony which ancient greek dramatists would have approved of .   everybody should see this movie ,  and someday ,  somehow ,  some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it .   it's wonderful . 
i saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years .  needless to say ,  the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic .  but still ,  alec guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly ,  if formulaic ,  romp through industrial post-wwii england .   this is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product .  remember the car that runs on water ?  remember the promise of nuclear energy ?  in this case ,  it's a fabric that doesn't wear out ,  wrinkle ,  or even get dirty !  of course ,  fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business ,  and so the plot gets a bit thick .   guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile ,  and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast !   ( those brits  .  .  .  always the stiff upper lip when under fire .  )  the film might chug along exactly like guiness's goofy invention ,  but it's a good ride all the same . 
 " the man in the white suit "  is another feather in the cap of expert scottish director alexander mackendrick  ( whisky galore !  ,  sweet smell of success )  .  the star of the film is alec guinness  ( whose comedies include kind hearts and coronets and the lavender hill mob )  .  guiness brings his usual class to the film ,  and makes it much more than a typical comedy .   in fact ,  the comedy isn't entirely overt .  by the end of the picture ,  it's nearly become a complete drama .  it's the sort of ealing studio comedy that is calculated not to produce laughter ,  but a sense of general amusement ,  like the best british comedy of the time .   the whole idea of the suit isn't very original ,  but the way it is executed is .  the film is highly original ,  and recommended to any fan of guiness or britsh comedy .   7 . 6 out of 10
 " they were always trying to get me killed ,  "  alec guinness once wrote of the man in the white suit's technicians .   " they thought actors got in the way of things .  "  he went on to describe how he'd been given a wire rope to climb down and ,  assured it was safe ,  narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid-descent .    " people get in the way of things "  might be a maxim tailor-made for white suit inventor sidney stratton  ( fittingly played blank slate-fashion by alec guinness )  in alexander mackendrick's definitive ealing film of 1951 .  certainly ,  he cares only about his work ,  its realisation - and sod the consequences .  and similarly ,  with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters ,  there's almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour .   told in flashback ,  the film concerns stratton's invention of a dirt-resistant ,  everlasting fibre  ( fashioned into the white suit of the title )  ,  and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it .   while the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market ,  the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job .  abduction and bribery attempts follow ,  with both money and an industry chief's daughter on offer  ( daphne ,  the delectable ,  4-packs-a-day-voiced joan greenwood )  ,  to the tragi-comic end .    " what's to become of my bit of washing when there's no washing to do ?  "  bemoans stratton's landlady near the close .  a notion stratton hadn't even considered - and has disregarded again by the movie's ambiguous coda .   a superior ,  if decidedly downbeat comedy ,  expertly performed - and pretty much answering the oft-raised question of whatever happened to the everlasting light bulb and the car that ran on water .  .  . 
while hollywood got sort of stagnant during the few years after wwii ,  england developed a very prolific film industry .  in  " the man in the white suit "  ,  inventor sidney stratton  ( alec guinness )  creates a suit that never gets dirty .  unfortunately ,  this means that certain other businesses are now likely to go out of business !  how can sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity ?  this is an example of one of the great movies in which alec guinness starred before he became obi wan kenobi .  it's a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world .  if you're planning to start any kind of business ,  you might want to consider watching this movie . 
other commentators have detailed the plot and the social parables and commentary as well  ( or better )  that i could ,  but i would like to join in my admiration for this little jewel of a film .  it holds up very well indeed more that 50 years later in every category - screenplay ,  acting ,  photography ,  set design ,  sound design .  .  . it really is a classic of sorts .  this was my first exposure to the  " young "  alec guinness ,  and it's obvious from the first frames what made him so special as to eventually receive a knighthood .    i only rate it an  " 8 "  because it's essentially a rather lightweight parable that examines human nature but doesn't really skewer it ;  and because the plot takes the easy way out at the end ,  rather than actually resolving conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and industrialists who are chasing him all over town .  also ,  a couple minutes of thought reveals the basic flaw in the logic of the screenplay - wear and tear is hardly ever the determining factor in buying new clothes  ( especially dress clothes )  ;  children grow up ,  people change sizes ,  gain and lose weight ,  and go with the latest fashions all the time ,  and have as long as looms have woven cloth .  and if nothing else ,  the manufacturer would make a fortune providing indestructible material for military uniforms  ( especially bdus )  .    still ,  this is a great film .  if you get a chance to see it on a classic movie channel ,  you should . 
ealing studios ,  a television and film production company based in west london ,  claims to be the oldest film studio in the world .  though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the 1930s ,  its golden age was most certainly between 1948 and 1955 ,  when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces ,  many starring the great alec guinness .  such well-known titles include 'whisky galore !   ( 1949 )  , ' 'passport to pimlico  ( 1949 )  , ' 'kind hearts and coronets  ( 1949 )  , ' 'the lavender hill mob  ( 1951 )  , ' 'the titfield thunderbolt  ( 1953 ) ' and 'the ladykillers  ( 1955 )  . ' one of ealing studio's most beloved films ,  'the man in the white suit , ' was released in 1951 ,  and starred alec guiness as sidney stratton ,  a brilliant inventor who engineers a remarkable fabric ,  an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friends .   sidney stratton is poor and unappreciated ,  but he has scientific talent in great abundance .  due to his under-qualification ,  the only jobs he is able to get are as a janitor or labourer at any of the large textile factories ,  where he secretly undertakes his own experiments using the company's own money and equipment .  after being found out and ejected countless times ,  sidney is convinced that he is only weeks away from a momentous scientific discovery that will revolutionise the textiles industry .  encouraged by his daughter daphne  ( joan greenwood )  ,  textile mill owner alan birnley  ( cecil parker )  takes a keen interest in sidney's exploits and agrees to finance any further work .  after numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth-shattering explosions ,  sidney eventually unveils his amazing creation :  an almost-luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out .   if sidney thought that his invention would make him a hero ,  then he was sorely disappointed .  the all-powerful bosses of textiles industry ,  headed by the frail sir john kierlaw  ( ernest thesiger )  ,  unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention ,  which could completely cripple their businesses ,  never goes into full-scale production .  likewise ,  the humble labourers in the workers' union hear of sidney's creation and also set out to erase it from existence ,  fearing for their jobs .  the inventor ,  however ,  is convinced that the ever-lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many ,  and refuses to give in to the demand of others ,  despite being threatened with violence and offered ₤250 , 000 in compensation .  throughout all his troubles to announce his invention to the media ,  only one person offers sidney her complete sympathy and support ,  birnley's daughter daphne ,  who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with sidney's plight anyway .   'the man in the white suit' is a clever and hilarious comedy ,  made great by a witty script  ( written by john dighton ,  roger macdougall and director alexander mackendrick )  and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable alec guinness .  there are also a few good-natured swipes at capitalism ,  and of how big industries can hold back progress for the sake of their own monetary situations ,  though we can certainly see the arguments for either side of the debate . 
often tagged as a comedy ,  the man in the white suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there .   sidney stratton is an eccentric inventor who isn't getting the chances to flourish his inventions on the world because nobody pays him notice ,  he merely is the odd ball odd job man about the place as it were .  after bluffing his way into birnley's textile mill ,  he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wears out ,  but also never needs to be cleaned !  .  he is at first proclaimed a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him ,  but then the doom portents of an industry going bust rears its head and acclaim quickly turns to something far more scary .   yes the film is very funny ,  in fact some scenes are dam hilarious ,  but it's the satirical edge to the film that lifts it way above the ordinary to me .  the contradictions about the advent of technology is a crucial theme here ,  do we want inventions that save us fortunes whilst closing down industries  ?  ,  you only have to see what happened to the coal industry in britain to know what i'm on about .  the decade the film was made is a crucial point to note ,  the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay ,  science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions .  you watch this film and see the quick turnaround of events for the main protagonist stanley ,  from hero to enemy in one foul swoop ,  a victim of his own pursuit to better mankind  !  ,  it's so dark the film should of been called the man in the black suit .   i honestly can't find anything wrong in this film ,  the script from roger macdougall ,  john dighton ,  and director alex mackendrick could be filmed today and it wouldn't be out of place such is the sharpness and thought of mind it has .  the sound and setting is tremendous ,  the direction is seamless ,  with the tonal shift adroitly handled by mackendrick .  some of the scenes are just wonderful ,  one in particular tugs on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in david lynch's elephant man some 29 years later ,  and yet after such a downturn of events the film still manages to take a wink as the genius that is alec guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers pondering not only the future of stanley ,  but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world .   a timeless masterpiece ,  thematically and as a piece of art ,  10/10 . 
a chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out ,  but it is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries .  in this delightful ealing studios comedy ,  guinness is marvelous as the mild-mannered but persistent chemist .  greenwood ,  with her sensual voice ,  plays the love interest ;  parker is her harried father .  thesiger is amusing as a patriarch of the fabric industry .  while telling an engaging story ,  the film also raises some intriguing questions about science ,  the economy ,  and politics .  it is adeptly directed by mackendrick ,  who would go on to make  " the ladykillers "  and the sublime  " sweet smell of success "  later in the 1950s . 
i enjoyed this film .  but i was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy .  it was amusing at times ,  but really ,  it wasn't very funny at all .  if i'd been expecting it to be a comedy ,  i might have been disappointed with the film ,  but ,  going in with no expectations ,  i found it to be enjoyable and engaging .  maybe it was because ,  as an engineer ,  i identified with the protagonist .  i was less concerned with satire of capital or labor ,  and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention .  a man who's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production .  he's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention .  so i find it interesting that people here have compared it to jurassic park ;  me ,  i compare it to the fountainhead . 
i am a huge john denver fan .  i have a large collection of his music on vinyl .  i saw this christmas special when it was originally on tv and loved it .  i have the original vinyl album and cd .  i have the original cd and later release .  the later release is missing several songs though .  i see that it has been released this year with all original songs .  to my surprise i found the original cd for sale at $75 . 00 .  wow - to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much .  to me no amount is worth selling this treasure .  it is my favorite christmas cd .  i have never been able to find it on vhs or dvd .  i would love to have either version .  if anyone has one available please let me know .  thanks
i first saw this version of  " a christmas carol "  when it first appeared on television .  i actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations .  i have now purchased the dvd and plan to watch it every year .  with the exception of  " it's a wonderful life "  i consider this version of  " a christmas carol "  one of the best christmas movies ever made .  george c .  scott is excellent and a superb cast led by roger rees surrounds him !  scott proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time .  scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself .  how can someone be remembered as both patton and scrooge ?  scott does so easily .  the direction is marvelous with the fine sets ,  costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time ,  place and era depicted .  you will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season . 
sidney stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories .  stratton's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric ,  one that never gets dirty ,  never wrinkles ,  or wears out .  when stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers  ( who will lose their jobs )  and the owners  ( who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights )  ,  so stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in england .  the film is ideal and only ealing could have made it so .  guiness' performance  ( and a great supporting cast such as greenwood ,  thesiger ,  and parker )  and mackendrick's direction make the film a delight ,  but the real hero is the story itself ,  a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama ,  romance ,  and suspense .  rating ,  8 . 
when i saw this film in the 1950s ,  i wanted to be a scientist too .  there was something magical and useful in science .  i took a girl - friend along to see it a second time .  i don't think she was as impressed as i was !  this film was comical yet serious ,  at a time when synthetic fibres were rather new .  lessons from this film could be applied to issues relating to gm experimentation of today . 
in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time .  the theme of workers v .  management  ( with lots of talk of unions and rights )  perhaps dates the film a bit now as it's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesn't stop  " white suit "  from being a show stopping classic .   the plot ,  about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil ,  doesn't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true ealing comedy .  the fabric repels dirt and can never wear out !  the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences ,  such as guinness being able to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall !  the script itself is full of dry wit -  " is he all right ?  "   " yes .  "   " pity .  "  - and characterisation is first rate .  i'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well .  comedies of later eras would adopt a  " point the camera at the actors and let it roll "  mentality but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations .  this film is no exception .   of course ,  it's the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights .  alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance ,  with eyes that convey wonder ,  joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it .  stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work .  such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable ,  so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything he's ever worked for .  joan greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual ,  as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough ;  everybody gets laughs without even trying to .  it's comical british understatement at its finest .    " the man in the white suit "  is 81 minutes of sheer brilliance ,  with a great plot ,  great cast ,  sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism .  absolutely top notch . 
although most americans have little knowledge of his work other than star wars ,  alec guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies .  i particularly love his comedies ,  as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from hollywood .   this being said ,  this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies .  it's plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere--except for ealing studios--which had a particular fondness for  " little "  films like this one .   guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company .  he wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible ,  though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work !  so ,  he tends to sneak into labs  ( either during the day if no one suspects or at night )  and try his hand at inventing .  repeatedly ,  he is caught  ( such as after he blew up the lab )  and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds !  then ,  despite the importance of the discovery ,  he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of events--and then the fun begins .   the film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry ,  unions ,  the government and people in general . 
one of the things that makes this ealing comedy so outrageously funny is the clever editing .  shots that would be considered absolutely essential to most modern comedies are deliberately left out .   ( this is what was known as british understatement .  )    three instances :  a comic fight is edited like this .  alec guiness has invented a new cloth that will ruin the industry .  half a dozen businessmen invite him to their office to try to get him to sign a contract relinquishing his control of the cloth so that production can be suppressed .  when he catches on to this ,  guiness stands up and turns to walk to the door .  two men block his way .   " excuse me ,  "  he says quietly ,  taking a step forward .  the two men move between guiness and the camera .  cut .  a secretary is sitting outside at her desk .  there is silence until the buzzer begins signaling her frantically .  she takes up her notebook and opens the door to the inner office where a full-fledged noisy donnybrook is in progress and the room is half wrecked .  guiness dashes out the open door .   the following example would be unthinkable today .  during the research phase of his invention guiness sets up an elaborate chemical apparatus but instead of converting the experimental liquid into the new cloth ,  the device explodes .  again and again it explodes .  the laboratory is cleared of all other work .  the blasts continue .  ceilings fall down .  windows are blown out .  the director of research is seated at his desk in a tiny office cluttered with debris ,  a bandage on his head .  when the door behind him opens he jumps a foot in the air .   " sit down ,  "  he tells his visitor ,   " there's another one due at any moment .  "  it is excruciatingly amusing -- and there is not a single shot of any explosions .  this would be unimaginable now without a fireball ,  and maybe a building collapsing in slow motion .   last example ,  consisting of a series of quick ,  relentless cuts ,  put together precisely .  guiness is being pursued and is cornered in the lobby of an office building by people who want him to sign the contract .  faced with two men about to grapple with him ,  guiness backs up with a determined expression .  he bumps against a pedestal with an iron bust on it .  the bust topples backward and bumps against the wall .  there is a shot lasting about one second of the bust hitting the wall .  another brief shot of a metal shield hung above the bust being jarred loose and falling down .  quick cut to guiness's head rising into the frame .  cut to the two men staring into the camera while horrible brass banging and thudding sounds are heard off screen .  cut to guiness flat on his back .  nobody today would have the cojones to not show guiness being crowned by that shield .   i won't go on with this .  it's a comedy alright but a pretty bitter one underneath all the hilarity .  in solving one set of problems ,  guiness has created dozens of others .  he is opposed both by management and labor ,  neither of which is shown to much advantage .  and of course the economic implications have to do with more than cloth .   " what about that car that runs on water with a pinch of something or other in it ?  "  one of the workers asks .   " vested interests ,  "  comments another worker ,  as thorstein veblen nods in his grave .  what would happen if our problems with energy were solved overnight ?  if i owned shares of exxon -- and i think i do -- i'd shudder at the thought .  where would the oil industry be if there were no more need for oil ?  for that matter ,  where would the police force and the fbi be if crime were to suddenly disappear ?  this is a thoughtful and very amusing movie ,  superbly directed and edited .  the roster of performers is peerless .  joanne greenwood with that husky voice .  the blithering cecil parker .  the wheezing mummified ernest thesiger .    a first-rate job all around . 
the man in the white suit ,  like i'm all right jack ,  takes a dim view of both labor and capital .  alec guinness is a scientific genius - but an eccentric one  ( he has never gotten his university degree due to an .  .  . err .  .  . accident in a college laboratory )  .  he manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry .  when the film begins he is in michael gough's company ,  and gough  ( in a memorable moment )  is trying to impress his would-be father-in-law  ( cecil parker )  by showing him the ship-shape firm he runs .  while having lunch with parker and parker's daughter  ( joan greenwood )  ,  gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab's unexpectedly large budget problems .  he reads the huge expenditures  ( due to guinness's experiments )  ,  and chokes on his coffee .   guinness goes on to work at parker's firm ,  and repeats the same tricks he did with gough - but parker discovers it too .  greenwood has discovered what guinness is working on ,  and convinces parker to continue the experiments  ( but now legally )  .  the result :  guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it's molecular structure so that  ( for all intents and purposes )  the fiber will remain in tact for good .  any textile made from it will never fade ,  get dirty ,  or wear out - it will last forever .   guinness has support from a female shop steward ,  but not her chief .  he sees guinness as selling out to the rich .  but when he explains to them what he's done ,  they turn against him .  if everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes !  soon parkers' fellow textile tycoons  ( led by gough ,  ernest theisinger - in a wonderful performance ,  and howard marion-crawford )  are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses .  they seek to suppress the invention .  with only greenwood in his corner  ( although parker sort of sympathizes with him )  ,  guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public .   in the end ,  guinness is defeated by science as well as greed .  but he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations ,  and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all .   it's a brilliant comedy .  but is the argument for suppression valid ?  at one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown  ( you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united .  there is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat  ( or contract if the owner gets thin )  .  are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever ?  what happened to fashion changes and new styles ?  and the cloth is only made in the color white  ( making guinness look like a white knight )  .  we are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process .  wouldn't that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile ?    alas this is not a science paper ,  but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry .  as such it is brilliant .  but those questions i mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing guinness' invention
an unassuming ,  subtle and lean film ,   " the man in the white suit "  is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from ealing studios .  while i suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure ,  i doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot ,  the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film's course .   the genuinely great alec guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as ealing's inspired  " kind hearts and coronets "  from 1949 .  this time ,  he merely plays one character rather than eight ,  but as the unworldly inventor and scientist sidney stratton ,  he always finds the correct tone and expression .  along with guinness' subtle ,  expressive performance ,  the rest of the cast are effective .  of the main players ,  cecil parker and ernest thesiger do stand out .  thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee ,  while parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father .  father ,  that is ,  of joan greenwood ,  the deftly delectable comic actress ,  who is at her insurmountable peak in this film .  resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction ,  she is quite sublime in this film ,  a fine contrast with the similarly unusual ,  but more maladroit guinness .  the scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing .  .  .   the themes are handled very effectively ,  with no easy morals drawn .  the complexities of the relationships between science ,  business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined .  expertly helmed by alexander mackendrick ,  this film is technically adept in all areas ;  evocative photography ,  fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script ,  all quietly impress .  a thoroughly satisfying film ,  with guinness and greenwood magnificent .   rating : - **** 1/2/*****
i've had this movie on tape for years and started watching it again this morning  ( while waiting for my laundry --- how ironic !  )  mostly because i wanted to hear benjamin frankel's title music again .  i ended up sitting through about the first half hour ,  entranced by how wonderfully assured the direction ,  writing ,  and performances are .  the movie is like a who's who of 50s british character stars :  cecil parker ,  michael gough ,  miles malleson ,  duncan lamont ,  and particularly ernest thesiger ,  great as the dessicated old giant of the textile mills .  not to mention alec guinness and joan greenwood ,  not character players as such but charming ,  charismatic leads .  this is science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well .  an all-time classic ,  and i hope no one ever tries to remake it ! 
this alec guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry ,  and a light eccentric character study as well .   the pacing is a bit slow for a comedy ,  and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny ,  except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments .  but it does have its amusing moments ,  and it is very deft in its execution .  the big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element .   the union procedures are quite droll ,  very reminiscent of i'm all right jack ;  especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on guinness' character .  the political machinations actually carry the story .  ernest thesigner is very notable as a heavy .   i don't think this one works quite as well as the ladykillers ,  or kind hearts and coronets ;  but even light ealing comedy is better than nothing . 
the man in the white suit is one of those delightful comedies that ealing studies made so well in the 40's and 50's .  the plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks .  of course ,  this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles .  however ,  things are not that simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people ,  including cloth manufacturers ,  the cloth mill's workforces ,  and even an old lady that does her washing every week .  the man in the white suit is a film about scientific advances ,  and the way that they don't always help ;  as the old woman says at one point in the movie ,   " why cant you scientists just leave things alone ?  "   like a lot ealing comedies ,  this one stars sir alec guinness .  alec guinness is a fantastic actor ;  he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence  ( and he does in this film ,  literally )  ,  but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way .  he is suitably creepy in this film ,  and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character ;  an intelligent and ambitious ,  but slightly naive scientist .  along with guinness ,  the man in the white suit also features joan greenwood ,  the deep voiced actress that co-starred with guinness in the simply divine  " kind hearts and coronets "  and michael gough ,  a man that would go on to get himself the role of alfred in the batman films .  the acting in the film isn't always great ,  but it is always decent ,  and it's fits with the film .   the man in the white suit is an intelligent ,  thought-provoking and witty comedy with a moral .  the comedy isn't always obvious ,  and it doesn't always work ,  but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes belly laughs ,  so that is forgivable .  i recommend this movie ,  basically ,  to anyone that is a fan of movies . 
this is the best film version of dicken's classic tale .  i've seen it over and over on vhs ,  and recently acquired the dvd version ,  which is formatted for tv  ( not wide-screen )  .  what i find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films/shows in north america since 1984 .  my biggest surprise is edward woodward ,   " the equalizer "  ,  as the ghost of christmas present . 
contains *spoilers* - also ,  my quotes may not be exact .   everyone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels - how true .  but to me ,  i see this movie as much more than that .  i love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit .  there is so much confusion and filth in the world around him ,  but it won't stick .  alec guiness was the perfect guy to play this - his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriate :    " that's ingenious - can you tell me ,  what is the ratio of ink to petrol ?  "   the only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention hasn't worked after all - standing there almost naked .  yet ,  more than shame is the simple disappointment that  " it didn't work .  "  he's never really intimidated by people .  remember ,    " but sidney ,  we want to stop it too .  "   barely a moments hesitation before he's off trying to get away again .  does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal must've caused ?  no .   also notable is dapne's role .  she is sick and tired of money and power .  she thinks she's finally found love ,  outside of her father's company .  at first she doesn't really care about sidney anymore than anyone else .  but that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him - and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention .  she's finally found something she thinks is worth living for .  the funny thing is that it's not even romance .  it is friendship ,  but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost doesn't fit .  it's more admiration ,  and perhaps even inspiration .   upon her discovery that michael has no real love for her ,  and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her ,  she gives into cynicism and tries to temp sidney .  fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power ,  money and lust .  what a refreshment :    " thank you sidney .  if you would've said 'yes' i think i'd have strangled you .  "   i love the very end ,  when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing .  but then ,  the bubbly ,  quirky beat starts up and sidney goes off ,  his stride matching the tune :  dauntless .  where is daphne ?  we don't really know - but they weren't really in love and she wasn't really a scientist .  he got help escaping and she got  " a shot in the arm of hope .  "   ( pollyanna )  a cont'd relationship would've been nice ,  but as billy joel says  " it's more than i'd hoped for .  .  .  "   
when i learned of sir alec guinness' death ,  this was the first of his many films i thought of re-seeing .  what a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years .  and guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame .  his eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears .  both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites . 
i can't say whether the post-wwii british comedies produced at the ealing studios are an acquired taste or not ,  but i am completely addicted ,  and the man in the white suit is one of the best .  no need to go into the well-known plot about the threat posed to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible ,  dirt-resistant fiber .  suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealistic sidney stratton in pursuing his polymer vision make for a comedic delight .  many of the well-known faces from the world of british character actors - the nervous cecil parker ,  the suavely devious michael gough ,  and the bluntly ruthless ernest thesinger - put in wonderful performances .  guinness - as always and forever - is superb ,  and joan greenwood is delectable as daphne  ( just the way she enunciates the word  " daddy "  ,  makes the entire movie worth seeing )  .    " knudsen !  !  !  !  !  !  !  " 
for me this is ealing studio's most perfect film - as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was the day it was released .   as a satire on economic notions of 'growth' and the commercial need for in-built obsolescence ,  it could scarcely be more up-to-the-minute .  and of what other film can it be said that the hero literally wears the plot ?   oddly ,  there are parallels with jurassic park ,  in which messing with the environment will literally turn round and bite you .  but spielberg shied away from the book's brilliant central conceit to tack on some nonsense about 'children' .  hmmm .   in the man in the white suit ,  alec guiness plays an idealistic young scientist who comes up with a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out .  suddenly workers and capital at the northern english mill where he is working are united as never before in protection of their livelihoods .   of course ,  being ealing ,  it's a comedy ,  but it needn't have been .  the complex interplay of vested  ( should that be suited ?  )  interests plays out beautifully ,  as one by one all parties realize that 'progress' is a threat ,  and that disposability and waste are what keep the looms turning .   but ,  yes ,  this is a comedy - albeit a pointed one - and amid the political ironies are delicious performances ,  and some good old-fashioned knock-about laughs .   nonetheless ,  it's the biting satire that endures - dazzling and white . 
a super comedy series from the 1990s  ( two series were made in total )  that suffered in the uk ratings due to poor scheduling .  when you are up against established comedies like 'minder' ,  even the best new comedies are going to struggle to get noticed .   luckily ,  i caught the series from episode one and followed it avidly .  i mentioned it to friends and family at the time ,  but everyone seemed to have been watching something else .  very ,  very frustrating .   anyway ,  i loved both series and never forgot it .   then i looked it up on the internet and found that an ultra-fan was trying to get both series released 'on his own' .   well ,  both series are now available on dvd .   http : //www . replaydvd . co . uk/joking_apart_s1 . htm
this is one of the funniest series ever !  i laughed till my sides split and rolled around on the floor .  if only someone would release in america .  region 0 or 1 - non-pal please .    i know it being released in the uk but that's region 2 and pal besides !  let's give this series its fair shake .  america must know this series .  moffat is a genius .  i loved tracie bennett's quirky ,  goofy role in this .  of course i liked fiona gillies !  but tracie was a treasure !   release this show in america !  or show it again on the pbs stations .  i need to laugh and laugh again !  please indulge us ,  please !  please !   thanks for reading . 
 " deliverance "  is a dead-on example of what wonderful movies came out of the '70s .  while your jaw is dropped during a  " terminator "  movie ,  are you really sacred ?  i don't think so ,  because you are there to see what new cgis have been strung together - plot matters not .   so many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all ,  because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market .  .  .  .  . or a walk down a dimly-lighted street .   " deliverance "  is so frightening ,  because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart-beat .  venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun ?  anyone who has that notion does not read the papers ,  watch the daily news ,  nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of  " trespassing "  into territories where outsiders are not welcome .  it is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on  " deliverance "  didn't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic ,  and  " squeal like a pig "  wasn't a part of  " deulling banjos "  .   i hate the term  " hillbillies "  ,  because - as some  " users "  wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life .  much is made of  " inbred "  - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods .   " chinatown "  should teach us that lesson .  however ,  city-slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude .  i know lots of  " hillbillies "  - they are moral people ,  when left to themselves .  their  " justice "  can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated ,  just like the  " justice "  in city streets .  they don't need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal sites .    " deliverance "  was the last film i found jon voight to do any real acting - i hope i'm wrong .  he was extremely underpaid for  " midnight cowboy "  ,  because he was unknown ,  but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat .  his acting in  " deliverance "  was superb .  it gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains ,  if it's necessary - but who wants to be thought-of as  " ordinary "  today ?  his stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant .  wow !  for burt reynolds  !  !  !  one must ask what led him into those other tacky films ?  his manliness ,  although misguided ,  in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods ,  but the wilderness of everyday-life .  ned beatty was stellar - his underwear may not have had  " versace "  stitched on it ,  but his shell-shocked performance was perfect .  as noted ,  he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie .  ronny cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man should have his determination to do what is right .  several  " users "  have theorized he was shot ,  or lost his balance when he pitched-into the river - my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey ,  he committed suicide .  no gunshot was heard during the scene and voight and beatty did not find a wound .   james dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale ,  and was great as the sheriff - it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day .  his character could see the three canoe-rs were guilty of surviving ,  but also knew they didn't stand a chance against a jury of the local people ,  no matter how kindly they were treated in  " aintry "  .  he was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel .  justice  ?  -  " don't come back up here again "  .  not many  " users "  knew  " hillbillies "  were used in the film where ever it was possible - what actors could portray them better ?  the  " mountain-men "  were actually mountain-men .  .  .  .  .  .  .   every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt it was dangerous to play in .  play in ?  better  " fight-for-your-life "  in .  i've experienced some near-dangerous incidents ,  and am content to live outside of the fray - you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part .   that we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable .  to be able to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling ,  but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it .  los angeles ,  where i live ,  is a perfect example :  it's built-up right into the territories for wild animals ,  and steadfastly believes humans come before animals .  those are their rightful habitats - we should leave them be just that .  any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods ?  they're theirs .   in some less threatening way ,  we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from  " deliverance "  - to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy .  i thank all those city-slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic ,  so that it can scare the heck out of me when i watch it .  you can have the thrill of danger - i'll stick to the tv .  30-out-of-10 . 
one of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from atlanta .  the idea of living the chulawasse river before it's turned into a lake comes from burt reynold's lewis ,  who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare .  but if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie ,  the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story ,  with our men forced to make a decision that  ( they know )  will change their lives forever .  in very bad ways .  at the end of the movie ,  each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week-end on the river but muted into a fight for survival .  the movie  ( except some pretty evident goofs )  is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath .  the photography is excellent as well .  voight ,  reynolds ,  cox and beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake . 
this movie is a classic in every sense of the word .  it is very entertaining and also very disturbing .  the acting in this movie is well done .  the story itself is believable ,  suspenseful ,  and well thought out .  character development is also done well ,  the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film .  the villains in this movie are very threatening ,  from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something .  this movie shows how a human being ,  when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods ,  facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it .  not everyone is going to like this film ,  there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable .  it is definitely worth watching .  this movie is a masterpiece . 
i am a member of a canoeing club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience .  as we put our boats into the water ,  banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind .  this movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human's place in nature and technology's effect upon man's relationship with nature .  we see it in the bow fishing .  we see it in the home made tent .  there is also city man's disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman  " cracker "  .  the fact that the banker from atlanta  ( ned beatty )  has  " bad teeth "  is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth .  ultimately ,  the struggle of life and death supersedes  " civilized man's "  suppositives about  " the law "  .  this canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer ,  but alas not soon enough for the characters . 
i saw a lot films about charles dickens' christmas carol .  but this one is the best of all !  there is an atmosphere which is exactly the same as in the book .  the actors  ( george c .  scott and others )  are great !  unfortunately ,  you can't often watch the film in germany and switzerland . 
and this is a very disturbing film .  i may be wrong ,  but this is the last film where i considered burt reynolds an actual actor ,  who transformed the role ,  and delivered a message .   jon voight and ned beatty are also excellent .  they are unassuming and unaware ;  businessmen wanting to enjoy the country .  little did they know what would happen next .   the photography and sets are realistic and natural .  this was before the days of wes craven .   what is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist .  in america ,  country folk still detest city people ;  it is almost a century and a half since the civil war .   you will enjoy this film .  it was filmed in the rural sections of south georgia ,  which still exist .  just don't drive past that to mobile ,  alabama ;  that area still has not been repaired since hurricane katrina .  10/10 . 
*spoilers* four men ,  ed  ( jon voight )  ,  lewis  ( burt reynolds )  ,  drew  ( ronny cox )  and bobby  ( ned beatty )  ,  decide to go on a rafting trip on the cahulawassee river ,  before it is flooded .   they wanted to have fun ,  to have a nice weekend in the nature .   but when two mountain men cross their path and rape one of them  ( bobby )  ,  everything begins to go to hell in a handbasket ,  and this 'nice weekend' will even cost one of the four's life .  .  .   'deliverance' ,  which in italian is stupidly titled 'un tranquillo weekend di paura'  ( 'a calm weekend of fear' )  ,  is the grandad of movies like 'texas chainsaw massacre' ,  'the hills have eyes' ,  'wrong turn' ,  'last house on the left' and all the other 'evil nature/revenge' subgenre films ,  and one of the scariest ,  right next to 'the hills have eyes' .   based on a book by james dickey  ( who appears in the movie as sheriff bullard )  ,  it's a chilling story on how someone can go into a situation thinking he knows everything ,  when he doesn't .   and the image of the dead man's hand raising from under the water ,  or the hands holding the rifle from the one-sheet are haunting images that will never leave your mind .   deliverance :  9/10 . 
impactful film of four city slickers in crisis in appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity .  each of four businessmen face their darkest fears when they tackle a challenging whitewater trip ,  on a river about to be replaced by a dam .  when locals along the way decide to  " have their way "  with the interlopers it leads to several deaths and loads of trauma for the survivors .  each of the travelers is outstanding ,  although voight gives the lead and strongest performance .  the rural scenery and culture is well-captured ,  including the breathtaking dueling banjos sequence .  i saw this on a date when it came out ,  not exactly the perfect date movie  ( although we both enjoyed it )  .  i sort of remember this as a break-out dramatic performance for burt ,  voight was already established .  not the sort of movie you could watch every week but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed . 
i recall seeing this film on tv some years ago and not paying full attention ,  maybe even missing the first half ,  so i came to the conclusion that it was dull and over rated .  i decided to revisit it last night to see if i had missed anything the first time .  i certainly did .  this is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever .  i can't believe i thought this film was boring !    a young jon voight and burt reynolds give the performances of their careers and are supported by ned beatty and ronny cox .  this story will leave you with a sense of disgust and dread long after you watch it ,  it is truly horrifying .  oh ,  and did i mention that the theme song is great ,  as well ?  well it is ,  and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere .   everyone should see this movie for the experience .  just don't expect a picnic . 
deliverance is john boorman's 1972 horror/thriller movie about a group of four atlanta businessmen  ( burt reynolds ,  jon voight ,  ned beatty and ronnie cox )  ,  that undertake a canoe trip down the cahulawassee river before the river is dammed .  along the way ,  a raft  ( no pun intended )  of unpleasant things happen to the men .  despite the nasty happenings in this picture ,  boorman captures the natural beauty of the river nicely .  the location was really chosen well .  indeed ,  this would still be a very nice film to watch ,  had the canoe trip gone smoothly .  the lush forests and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible .  not only is the location scenic ,  but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer vilmos zsigmond .  it has been said that burt reynolds' performance as the outdoorsman ,  lewis ,  is the star acting role in this film .  i reckon however ,  that jon voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man ,  ed ,  who is rapidly forced to change his demeanour in order to survive .  in fact ,  the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a stuntman .  it was voight himself .  to cut costs the filming wasn't insured and the actors did their own stunts .  the soundtrack is particularly noteworthy .  eric weissberg's and steve mendel's performance on guitar and banjo as part of the duelling banjos sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance .  at a couple of other points in the movie ,  we are treated to more ,  softer ,  banjo music which provides a very pleasant accompaniment to the trip down the river for all the good points of this film ,  i did find it a little lacking in purpose .  it doesn't build suspense very well and it isn't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe .  the plot itself is somewhat poor and it doesn't really go anywhere .  nevertheless ,  this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation .  i did like it but for fans of gore ,  there isn't really much of it .  none really ,  in fact .  it isn't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour .  think of it like rambo :  first blood meets three men in a boat .  look out for a very young charley boorman as ed's son .  i did like this movie ,  the soundtrack ,  cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10 . 
 " it's all up to you ,  ed ?  "   " now you get to play the game .  "  the day my father left my mother ,  he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend ,  on opening day at the cinerama dome in hollywood .  i was but fourteen years old .  i wasn't even entirely sure what i was seeing ,  but i will never forgot it ,  especially the scene with ned beatty .   watching it today ,  thirty-six years later ,  it still gives me quivers .   my father was a huge burt reynolds fan ,  hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie . ' i had seen two films at the dome prior to this :   " grand prix "  and  " the song of norway .  "  well this wasn't exactly mario andretti or the brady bunch .  after leaving the theater ,  i was shell-shocked .   but even at that tender age ,  i appreciated the artistry .  .  . and after seeing again today ,  am i surprised i was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing ,  yet extremely well-crafted film .   suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year-old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend .  i don't blame my father for taking me ,  but it was a bit much for a child to witness .   as an adult ,  i still find it quite disturbing ,  yet i am still very impressed with the quality of the film-making .   burt reynolds as an absolute wonder ,  as are all the principles .  .  . from billy redden as the inbred guitar wonder ,  to ronny cox as the terrified insurance salesman .  .  . everyone does an admirable job .  the sound quality is second to none ,  from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks .  the photography ,  cinematography .  .  . all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate .   the moral questions raised ,  from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being ,  remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released .  and the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life-altering .  these four men ,  city men ,  suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined ,  raise the bar from action to horror .   it's a classic to be sure .  and the phrase  " you have a pretty mouth "  has been quoted endlessly ,  from saturday night live to off-the-cuff comments around water-cooler at work ,  this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture .  .  . as much as  " make my day "  or  " i'll be back "  ever were .   so what would you do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city ,  cozy bed ,  wife and kids ?  and if you took the measures burt reynolds did  ( and i would have done the same )  would you bury the body beneath the soon-to-be-lake ,  or stand trial and take your chances ?  the bottom line is :  deliverance delivers .  you can take that to the bank .  if this movie doesn't get under your skin ,  then you are not human .   even if you have seen this before ,  rent it again and ask yourself the above question .   my favorite part of the film remains the same :  ed failing to kill the deer .  .  . then changing .  life and it's unpredictable circumstance can change a man .  and i suppose that's what this film is all about jon voight ,  in particular ,  as ed ,  gives the best performance here .  and he remains one of the more gifted actors in hollywood history ,  from midnight cowboy to his highly underrated performance as franklin d .  roosevelt in pearl harbor ,  his acting lifts the movie to another level .  climbing the rocks at dusk ,  terrified and determined to make it right it needs to be seen to be believed .  i guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level .   briskly paced ,  tense ,  taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string ,  this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today .  times have changes ,  but our choices as human beings have not .   ten out of ten stars . 
when a movie shocks you with it's disturbing ,  brooding atmosphere ,  and grabs you by the throat with it's stunning cinematography ,  you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat ,  masterpiece of a film .  although with most modern movies ,  extremely enjoyable as some are ,  those that really shock you into focus are the strongest ,  and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly ,  stick with you for a life time .  i say ,  proudly ,  that i am a fan of movies that disturb ,  not just horror movies ,  but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding .  movies like breakdown and the missing ,  that send a chill down your spine ,  making you think  " holy crap ,  that could happen to me "  ,  and visually entice you ,  are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie .  because i am only 21 ,  i did not grow up with actors like burt renyolds ,  jon voight and ned beatty ,  albeit i am familiar with them ,  i didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors ,  as opposed to actors now like shia labouf and justin long .  i must say ,  after the long hype and witnessing deliverance for the first time ,  i was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago ,  and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies .  burt renyolds plays lewis ,  the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made ,  filling the whole wilderness in water .  renyolds' character is an experienced adventurer ,  sort of no nonsense ,  and filled with machismo .  witnessing him portray the tough guy ,  made me think differently about him as an actor ,  as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician .  the dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader .  ronny cox and ned beatty play as the novice adventurers ,  drew and bob respectively ,  joining in for the fun of a canoe trip .  the actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was jon voight ,  once again i have only seen him as an older actor ,  however ,  unlike renyolds ,  i have quite liked voight's acting  ( and i don't regard anaconda when i say that )  ,  for example the national treasure movies .  voight plays ed ,  whom ,  like lewis ,  is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character ,  a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks lewis' machismo .  the film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside .  you immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to ,  like the imbred kid who plays the infamous  " duelling banjo's "  at the start of the film with ronny cox's character drew ;  and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene .  as with all atmospheric movies ,  from this moment on ,  dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form .  the canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature's odds for survival .  the film's cinematics do not let up ,  and i back that comment up with the scene in which ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow .  as ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him ,  cocks his rifle ,  only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck ;  was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting i have seen in a film .  in wrapping up ,  deliverance is one film ,  who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date ,  remains one of the best films in cinematic history . 
this is one of the greatest films ever made .  it's an all-time classic .  the character played by ned beatty undergoes one of the greatest on screen transformations ever portrayed .  he is a shallow ,  almost useless ,  overweight insurance salesman .  he is proud of his ignorance ,  and yet judges the  " backwards hicks "  to be the ignorant ones .  when he compliments the old man on his hat ,  and the old man responds ,   " you don't know nothing' ,  "  the tone is set .  it's true .  he really doesn't  " know nothing' .  "  but one backwoods anal rape later ,  the man is practically a warrior .  his shallow fake bravery is toned down into serious resolve .  the old self is forever dead ,  left in some far off woods ,  soon to be under hundreds of feet of water .  and what of lewis ,  our intrepid guide ?  lewis is a philosopher/hunter/warrior ,  and he's just about nuts .  burt reynolds proved himself as an actor way back in 1972 in this film ,  completely giving himself in to this wonderful role .  who wouldn't want to have a friend like lewis if one was to venture into the dangers of a forgotten/soon to be left behind world like the one our hapless travelers find themselves in .  this film speaks to us on so many levels .  the story feels real .  it works as a complete action/adventure ,  with wonderful cinematography ,  and deliberate ,  grinding pacing .  it works as a bit of a horror film ,  with the danger and almost surrealism of the encounter with the vile rednecks who objectify their  " sow "  ned beatty .  but it also works as an art film ,  using incredible amounts of symbolism to convey truths that go to our very core .  i have seen this film at least fifty times ,  and every time it comes on ,  i find i have to watch it .  you have to watch it quite a few times to even begin to comprehend it .  this is one deep movie .  this is one well-acted movie .  and this is one hell of a story .  i gave it a 10 out of 10 ,  and put it in my 10 all time greatest films ever made ,  along with schindler's list ,  casablanca ,  taxi driver ,  and sling blade ,  among others .  movies that make you think .  movies that take you beyond having to think .  movies that use a story to make their point ,  without trying to preach to you .  if you think you know deliverance ,  you might ,  but again ,  you might not .  it really is that good . 
before watching this film i had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the film ,  but listening wasn't doing it for me so i planned on watching it and wow !  ned beatty ,  ronny cox ,  jon voight and burt reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hell bent on canoing down the cahulawassee river and the unfortunate series of events that transpires upon them all .  the character development takes some time in enveloping the viewer with a better understanding of each person ,  but eventually you know these guys like they were your friend .  the acting ,  dialogue is very very real ,  as close to reality as you can get for hollywood acting .  reynolds character  " lewis "  was interesting as a guy who comes off very tough but underneath the manly veneer lies a very soft and broken man  ( i was impressed with his performance !  )  jon voight seems to be the character thats on the spotlight the most ,  the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really mold and caste him into a different man at the end  ( his character transition was excellent )  .  ned beatty and ronny cox really seem like the silly lunkheads that just like to joke around and don't seem to get too awful serious unless they have too ,  and they did .  .  .  i really was amazed at director boorman's vision of dickey's novel ,  very impressed .  you cannot go your whole life without watching this film .  i give it eight out of ten stars ,  extremely impressed . 
 " deliverance "  is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970's decade from whence so many other exploitation films came .   a group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives .  it's awesome .   we are treated to anal rape ,  vicious beatings ,  bow and arrow killings ,  shootings ,  broken bones ,  etc .  .  .  a lot like 1974's  " texas chainsaw massacre ,  "  to say that  " deliverance "  is believable would be immature .  this would never and could never happen ,  even in the dark ages of 1972 .    " deliverance "  is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action .  it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70's and it  ( arguably )  sits on top of that pile with it's great acting ,  superb cinematography and excellent writing .   8 out of 10 ,  kids . 
you could stage a version of charles dickens'  " a christmas carol "  with sock puppets and i'll probably watch it .  ever since i was a child ,  this has been one of my favorite stories .  maybe it's the idea that there is good in everyone ,  and that therefore no one is beyond redemption ,  that appeals to me ,  but for whatever reason i never miss an opportunity to watch one of the many screen adaptations of this timeless classic when they're on tv as they inevitably are this time of year .   what makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles .  lines we've heard dozens of times in the past take on a whole new intensity ,  and each character becomes more real and believable in the hands of this wonderful ensemble .   george c .  scott was nominated for an emmy in 1985 for this role .  it is to his everlasting credit that rather than sleepwalking through this oft-portrayed role of scrooge ,  he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was ,  in my opinion ,  one of his finest performances ever .  he wisely did not attempt a british accent ,  instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice .  his scrooge is not merely a cranky old man  ( as he is so often portrayed )  ,  but a man who harbors a profound anger against the world .  as he is visited in turn by each of the three spirits ,  we understand how this anger took root ,  grew ,  and ultimately strangled his soul .  as he is forced to review his life ,  we see him alternately softening ,  and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy .  and in the great dramatic scene when he ,  kneeling and weeping at his own grave ,  begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life ,  we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively .  scott has made scrooge utterly believable and painfully human .   impressive as scott's performance is ,  the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this version's dark beauty .  fred holywell ,  scrooge's nephew ,  is an excellent example of this .  often portrayed as an affable buffoon ,  here he is played by roger rees with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals .  when he implores scrooge ,   " i ask nothing of you .  i want nothing from you .  why can't we be friends ?  "  ,  we see in his face not only his frustration ,  but his pain at scrooge's self-imposed separation from his only living relative .  it is a moving performance ,  and one of the movie's most dramatic scenes .   even more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful english actor frank finlay as scrooge's late partner ,  jacob marley .  in most versions of this tale ,  the scene with marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film ,  simply because it's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly ,  and the results are usually just plain silly  ( ooooh ,  look ,  it's a scary ghost .  .  .  .  .  .  . not !  )  in this version ,  it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie .  marley's entrance ,  as the locks on scrooge's door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house ,  is wonderfully creepy .  but finlay's marley is no ethereal spirit .  he is a tortured soul ,  inspiring both horror and pity .  marley may be a ghost ,  but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth ,  and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress ,  are still very human .  as portrayed by finlay ,  we have no problem believing that even the flinty scrooge would be shaken by this nightmarish apparition .  finlay really steals the scene here ,  something not easy to do when you're opposite george c .  scott .   and it just goes on and on ,  one remarkable performance after another ,  making it seem like you're experiencing this story for the first time .  edward woodward  ( remember him from the equalizer ?  )  is by turns both jovial and menacing as the ghost of christmas present .  when he delivers the famous line ,   " it may well be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child "  he is no longer a jolly santa claus surrogate ,  but an avenging angel who gives scrooge a much needed verbal spanking .   susannah york is a wonderfully tart tongued mrs .  cratchit ,  and david warner brings marvelous depth to the long suffering bob cratchit ,  a man who goes through life bearing the triple crosses of poverty ,  a sick child ,  and an insufferable boss .  his face alternately shows his cheerful courage ,  and also ,  at times ,  his weariness ,  in the face of intolerable circumstances .  later ,  in the scene in which scrooge is shown by the ghost of christmas yet to come the cratchit family after the death of tiny tim ,  warner's performance ,  while hardly uttering a word ,  will move you to tears . 
the makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters , as they suffered through this horrible ordeal . the horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors , playing parts . i have never gotten so immersed in a film as i have this one . burt reynolds and jon voight were never better on screen , as well as fine performances by ned beatty , ronny cox , bill mckinney , and though he appeared only briefly , james dickey , the man who authored the book upon which the film is based , as the sheriff of aintry . it is somewhat disturbing , and kids , of course , should be shielded from it , but this is great , dramatic cinema . 
deliverance is a stunning thriller ,  every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomach-churningly frightening .  though it is not a horror movie ,  it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film .  the very thought of being a normal red-blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation ,  only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies ,  is surely the worst nightmare of 99 . 9% of the world's population .  it would have been easy for deliverance to slip into exploitation territory ,  but john boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores ,  questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity .  with so many films ,  you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero's shoes ,  performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl .  .  .  .  but with deliverance ,  you come away praying to god that you'll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through .   four city guys - ed  ( jon voight )  ,  lewis  ( burt reynolds )  ,  drew  ( ronny cox )  and bobby  ( ned beatty )  - head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soon-to-be-dammed river .  the guys are riding the rapids in pairs ,  and ed and bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland .  here ,  they fall foul of two local woodlanders  ( bill mckinney and herbert coward )  ,  who tie ed to a tree ,  while one of them strips and rapes bobby instructing him ,  perversely ,  to  " squeal like a pig "  .  lewis and drew arrive unseen and lewis ,  being a fair archer ,  kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest .  under great emotional stress ,  the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area .  but they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream ,  and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the river .   deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale ,  but even more powerful  ( and disturbing )  as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters .  though all the performances are remarkable ,  one must take particular note of beatty's efforts in a role that many actors would've turned down .  the film is very similar thematically to the 1971 film straw dogs - both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales ,  and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction .  the backdrop of the rugged countryside in deliverance is beautiful to look at ,  but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape ,  with nobody to rely on other than themselves .  this truly is suspenseful film-making at its finest . 
it's a shame that deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for dueling banjos .  even people that have seen the film can't get their mind off of that rape scene .  it's not as bad as the rape scene in pulp fiction .  it's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie .  people tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scene .   the acting ,  plot ,  cinematography ,  and soundtrack of deliverance all lend a hand to it's brooding charisma .  the backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter .  the actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them .    the thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires .  not many films can make you feel this creeped out .  bottom line :  this movie is a classic .  i can't really say much more than that . 
***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** packed with memorable moments  ( such as the quote above ,  immortalized by primus )  ,  deliverance tells the story of four guys who take a trip to the wild woods to go white water rafting and get away from the big city for a while only to find that their fun soon takes a bad turn .  this is not a hollywood film .  there are virtually no special effects whatsoever ,  the setting is extremely realistic ,  and nothing at all is sugarcoated or made pretty .  the city boys look like city boys ,  and even the tough guy louis ,  portrayed with precision by burt reynolds ,  is clearly at the mercy of the wild on this trip .  this is a perfect example of a what-if film .  what if a few friends went river rafting in an area of the woods that none of them were familiar with ,  and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted for murders that they were forced to commit to save their own lives ?   there is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with societal and class structure and the relationship  ( or lack thereof )  between rural and urban peoples .  when the four guys arrive in the woods early in the film ,  they clearly do not quite know how to interact with the people who live out there ,  and they speak to them as though they are unsure whether they will understand or be able to communicate .  this communication block is most memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene ,  in which they are trying to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles downriver for them .  while drew and the obviously inbred and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo  ( one of the best scenes in the film )  ,  louis is having some difficulty buying the gas ,  and bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it all is .  when the boy turns away from drew ,  who had offered to shake his hand after their stupendous jam session ,  bobby tells him to give the kid a couple bucks ,  knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react .   this is the kind of thing that we see in deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow .  this great scene where a lot of fun was had  ( including the funniest 'redneck dancing' scene until o brother ,  where art thou ?  )  ended with everyone awkwardly unsure what to do around each other .  these people are apples and oranges ,  and they live by completely different rules of life .  the people that louis ,  bobby ,  drew and ed encounter in the hills grew up separated from modern society and modern laws ,  and live by the rules of nature ,  which do not include thou shalt not kill .  confused by their awkward behavior ,  the four friends set out on the river ,  hoping for the weirdness to end and for the adventure to begin .    ( spoilers )  when they are briefly separated from each other and ed and bobby run into the hillbillies beside the river who quickly turn unpleasant ,  the uncertainty about the way that these people live - which was established by the scene above - comes into play to create the most tension during the scene .  i think that a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film ,  namely the assaults and actual murders ,  takes up a very small amount of screen time but remain some of the most memorable parts of the film .  there is no gratuitous violence here ,  it's all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a startlingly powerful effect .   the move is about the violent clash of two very different kinds of people ,  and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other .  the trip down the rest of the river after the assault ,  which takes up the majority of the film ,  delivers some spectacularly effective tension ,  and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with so much happening that you become numb .  it is surprisingly effective when we find out that ed may very well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff ,  and the tension in the film doesn't even let up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river ,  because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law is missing .   this is a very disturbing film ,  which is a testament to its success ,  because it's pretty obvious that a film like this is meant to shake people up a little bit .  the hillbillies are the human  ( i . e .  more realistic )  version of the sub-human rednecks seen in childish but fairly similar films like gator bait and gator bait 2 ,  neither of which could possibly ever be compared to a timeless film like deliverance .  when we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the woods ,  the natural element is so real and we get to know the men so well and in such a subtle fashion that it's almost like we ,  as individuals of the audience ,  are really a fifth member of the team .  it's not often that a film is able to come across that way . 
this is without a doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen .  the first time i saw it i was about 9 or 10 years old .  i began looking sometime before the rape scene .  and when i saw it i was really shocked thinking  " what kinda sick movie is this ?  "  .  today i've seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is .  it's exciting ,  frightening ,  shocking and in it's own unique way disturbing .  but the best thing about it is the ending where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lifes .  it'll torture their conscience and they will worry for the rest of their lifes about the bodies being found in that river .  and there is nothing they can do about it ,  it's something they have to live with .  this ending is one of the most unhappy endings in movie history and very smart ,  brilliant and horrifying  and the acting is also great ,  especially jon voight and burt reynolds .  magnificent acting in this movie .  all in all ,  john boorman has created one of the best movies throughout movie history based on dick chaney's novel .  a must see for all the movie lovers
james dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author .  when one reads  " deliverance "  ,  one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the deep south .  when one watches john boorman's film version of the book ,  one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book .  the camera is as descriptive as the narration .  the characters are fully realized ,  and the portrayals are fantastic .  i first saw this movie in 1992 ,  after my freshman year of college .  i was in a phase where i was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973 .  among them were  " patton "  ,   " papillon "  ,  and  " all the president's men "  ;  fine films ,  all of them .  this one was easily the class of the group .  that says a lot . 
engrossing drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river .  they are pacifist ed  ( jon voight )  ,  adventurous ,  violent lewis  ( burt reynolds )  ,  obnoxious bobby  ( ned beatty )  and nice guy drew  ( ronny cox )  .  the first 40 minute are great--there's the incredible dueling banjos sequence ,  interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by vilmos zsigmond .  then two hillbillies attack ed and bobby .  one of them rapes bobby .  .  . and the trip becomes a nightmare .   just unbelievable .  the scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place .  to be truthful ,  beatty's rape has never bothered me--i'm very aware it's being faked despite the good acting .  this movie also shows how the characters change--ed has his pacifism tested ,  lewis becomes weak ,  bobby is violated by one of the people he mocked earlier on and drew tries to keep himself sane .  direction by john boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely .   the acting is mostly good .  voight is just ok in the lead--he's been better .  beatty is also just ok--but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a risky role .  cox is very good especially when things start falling apart .  and reynolds is just superb--one of his best acting jobs ever !  how this wasn't even nominated for an academy award escapes me .  also bill mckinney and herbert coward are way too believable as the hillbillies .   a powerful film--not for children .  try to see an uncut version--the tv version is butchered .  also letter-boxed viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images . 
this was ,  undoubtedly ,  the most disturbing movie that i have ever seen .  the first part of the movie ,  though strange ,  has a light and amusing quality to it .  the journey begins on such a peaceful note ,  detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of appalachia .  but that is misleading beyond belief .  the obvious social problems  ( inbreeding )  and the deformities of the countryside's inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie .  i can still hear bobby moaning in pain ,  and i shudder at the thought .  lewis's leg made me wince .  yet ,  while the movie was ,  on the whole ,  very disturbing and distressing ,  it posed some interesting questions .  when is it moral ,  or right to take another individual's life ?  what can morality drive us to do ,  or not do ,  in some cases ?  and are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself ?  whatever conclusions one may draw from the film ,  it is an achievement in its own right  ( despite certain aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome )  . 
i watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when i should have been asleep .  this ,  in itself ,  was testimony that deliverance was a spell-binding movie .  i think boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film .  how expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done .  it showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were .  case in point - near the end of the  " duel "  ,  the banjo-playing boy was smiling  ( loved his banjo )  ,  but when drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the  " duel "  ,  the kid was too reserved to respond .  the river trip never left you bored ,  for sure .  the rape scene was brutal ,  but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of georgia .  i think beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done .  some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal .  i disagree - if you really payed attention ,  he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following ,  in which reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy .  it was confusing when ed killed the other guy later ,  at the top of the cliff .  it almost appeared that the arrow was shot while ed was curled up and expecting to die ,  but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect .   anyway ,  a great movie ,  and i was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote ,  but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a  " 1 "  ,  i gave it a  " 10 "  .  this individual's reasoning seemed based on personal bias ,  rather than an objective viewpoint ,  and his vote was obviously a non-correlating attempt to lower the rating . 
as peckinpah did with straw dogs ,  and kubrick with a clockwork orange ,  director john boorman delivers an effective film about man's violent side in deliverance ,  arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s .  burt reynolds ,  jon voight ,  ned beatty ,  and ronny cox portray four atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild cahulawassee river in northern georgia before it is dammed up into what reynolds calls  " one big ,  dead lake .  "   but the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these  " city boys "  carousing through their woods .  and the following day ,  continuing on down the river ,  beatty and voight are accosted and sexually assaulted  ( the film's infamous  " squeal !  "  sequence )  by two vicious mountain men  ( bill mckinney ,  herbert  " cowboy "  coward )  .  thus ,  what started out as nothing more than a lark through the appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism .   james dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book ,  and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker .  often known for its  " squeal !  "  and  " dueling banjos "  sequences ,  deliverance is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal ,  with the four leading men superb in their roles ,  and mckinney and coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times .  a must-see film for those willing to take a chance . 
this story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine .  the immortal charles dicken's story has been recreated in every possible way imagine .  i admit i have not seen the classic alistair sim version and i'm sure someday i will but i would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version .  i believe that if dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it .   the story is well known ,  i won't go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another .  a rich ,  stingy ,  mean ,  old man is visited by the ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways .  in order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits ,  each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with ,  past ,  present and future .  finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has done .   george c .  scott is absolutely ,  undeniably perfect for this role .  he takes hold of the ebeneezer scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character .  he is not just a mean old man ,  but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world .  there is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved .  scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to scrooge .   not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place .  this is a grand epic of victorian england ,  dickens england is recreated before our very eyes ,  the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market .  director clive donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination .  i could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery .  it's not spectacular scenery per se but it's real .  the film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in between .   the rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life .  bob cratchitt ,  played by david warner and his entire family including and especially the young tiny tim played by anthony walters were wonderful .  the ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story .  a christmas carol is not a light story .  dickens wrote this story for a dark period in england's life and it's one of the few christmas tales that is really dark ,  almost scary ,  and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around .  the dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures christmas miracles .  the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it's the actual score or the christmas music ,  everything fits together .  apparently christmas movies are my favorite because i insist everyone see this christmas carol above all others .  10/10
john boorman's  " deliverance "  concerns four suburban atlanta dwellers who take a ride down the swift waters of the cahulawassee the river is about to disappear for a dam construction and the flooding of the last untamed stretches of land   the four friends emphasize different characters :  a virile sports enthusiast who has never been insured in his life since there is no specific risk in it  ( burt reynolds )  ;  a passionate family man and a guitar player  ( ronny cox )  ;  an overweight bachelor insurance salesman  ( ned beatty )  ;  and a quiet ,  thoughtful married man with a son who loves to smoke his pipe  ( jon voight )  .   what follows is the men's nightmarish explorations against the hostile violence of natureit is also an ideal code of moral principle about civilized men falling prey to the dark laws of the wilderness   superbly shot ,  this thrilling adult adventure certainly contains some genuinely gripping scenes
after having seen deliverance ,  movies like pulp fiction don't seem so extreme .  maybe by today's blood and bullets standards it doesn't seem so edgy ,  but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently .   when i started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until i got to the  " dueling banjos "  scene .  in that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible .  as i watched drew ( ronny cox , robocop ) go head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get .  when you think that the kid has a small banjo ,  which he could of probably made by hand ,  compared to drew's nice expensive guitar ,  you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are .   as the plot goes it's very believable and never stretches past its limits .  but what really distinguishes this film ,  about four business men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip ,  is that director john boorman ( excalibur )  breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes .  so as the movie goes into full horror and suspense i really cared about all four men and what would happen to them .   the acting is universally excellent .  with jon voight ( midnight cowboy ,  enemy of the state )  and burt reynolds ( boogie nights ,  striptease )  leading the great cast .  jon voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable .  unlike reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start ,  voight's character transforms over the course of the movie .  ned beatty ( life )  is also good in an extremely hard role ,  come on getting raped by a hillbilly ,  while ronny cox turns in a believable performance .   one thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any i had ever seen .  bill mckinney and herbert  " cowboy "  coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly's .   overall deliverance was excellent and i suggest it to anyone ,  except for people with weak stomachs and kids .  10/10 .  see this movie . 
deliverance is the fascinating ,  haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by james dickey ,  turned into a brilliant movie by john boorman .  it's about four businessmen ,  driven by manhood and macho-behavior ,  who're spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains .  up there ,  they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery .  .  . poverty ,  buggery and even physical harassment !  these four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain-land ,  completely estranged from all forms of civilisation .  all these elements actually make deliverance one of the most nightmarish films i've ever seen .  just about everything that happens to these men ,  you pray that you'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation .  pure talking cinema ,  deliverance is a very important movie as well .  john boorman's best  ( closely followed by zardoz and excalibur )  was - and still is - a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies .  just think about the terrific  " duelling banjos "  musical score and ,  of course ,  the unforgettable homosexual  " squeal like a pig "  rape scene .  all the actors deliver  ( haha )  perfect acting performances .  especially jon voight .  a must see motion picture !  ! 
in what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time ,  four city guys confront nature's wrath ,  in a story of survival .  the setting is backwoods georgia ,  with its forests ,  mountains ,  and wild rivers .   the director ,  john boorman ,  chose to use local people ,  not actors ,  to portray secondary characters .  these locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history .  no central casting  " actors "  could ever come close to these people's remarkable faces ,  voices ,  or actions .  i don't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful .  as much as anything else ,  it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing .   another strength is the film's theme .  nature ,  in the wild ,  can be violent .  how appropriate that the setting should be the american south .  very few places in the u . s .  are ,  or have been ,  as violent as redneck country .  in a story about darwinian survival of the fittest ,  the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature ,  not separate from it .    " deliverance "  is very much a product of its time when ,  unlike today ,  americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness .  the film's magnificent scenery ,  the sounds of birds ,  frogs ,  crickets ,  and the roar of the river rapids ,  combined with the absence of civilization ,  all convey an environmental message .  and that is another strength of the film .   at an entertainment level ,  the tension gradually escalates ,  as the plot proceeds .  not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme ,  and then never lets up ,  not until the final credits roll .  very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot .   finally ,  the film's technical quality is topnotch .  direction and editing are flawless .  cinematography is excellent .  dialogue is interesting .  and the acting is terrific .  burt reynolds has never been better .  ned beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job .  and jon voight should have been nominated for an oscar .  if there is a weak link in the film ,  it is the music ,  which strikes me as timid .   overall ,   " deliverance "  almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure .  even for those who don't ,  the gritty characterizations ,  the acting ,  and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film ,  one of the finest in cinema history . 
'deliverance' is a brilliant condensed epic of a group of thoroughly modern men who embark on a canoe trip to briefly commune with nature ,  and instead have to fight for their sanity ,  their lives ,  and perhaps even their souls .  the film has aged well .  despite being made in the early seventies ,  it certainly doesn't look particularly dated .  it still possesses a visceral punch and iconic status as a dramatic post-'death of the sixties' philosophical-and-cultural shock vehicle .  there are very few films with similar conceits that can compare favourably to it ,  although the legendary sam peckinpah's stuff would have to be up there .  yes ,  there has been considerable debate and discussion about the film's most confronting scene  ( which i won't expand upon here )  - and undoubtedly one of the most confronting scenes in the entire history of the cinematic medium - but what surprises about this film is how achingly beautiful it is at times .  this seems to be generally overlooked  ( yet in retrospect quite understandably so )  .  the cinematography that captures the essence of the vanishing ,  fragile river wilderness is often absolutely stunning ,  and it counterbalances the film as ,  in a moment of brief madness ,  we the viewers - along with the characters themselves - are plunged into unrelenting nightmare .  'deliverance's narrative is fittingly lean and sinewy ,  and it is surprising how quickly events unfold from point of establishment ,  through to crisis ,  and aftermath .  it all takes place very quickly ,  which lends a sense of very real urgency to the film .  the setting is established effectively through the opening credits .  the characters are all well-drawn despite limited time spent on back story .  we know just enough about them to know them for the kind of man they are ,  like them and ultimately fear for them when all goes to hell .  the conflict and violence within the movie seems to erupt out of nowhere ,  with a frightening lack of logic .  this is author james dickey's theme - that any prevailing romanticism about the nature of man's perceived inherent 'goodness' can only wilt and die when his barely suppressed animal instincts come to the fore .  there are no demons or bogeymen here .  the predatory hillbillies - as the film's central villains - are merely crude ,  terrifyingly amoral cousins of our protagonists .  they shock because their evil is petty and tangible .  the film has no peripheral characters .  all reflect something about the weaknesses and uncertainties of urbanised homo sapiens in the latter 20th century ,  and all are very real and recognisable .  burt reynolds is wonderful in this movie as the gung-ho and almost fatally over-confident survivalist ,  lewis ,  and it is a shame to think that he really couldn't recapture his brief moment of dramatic glory throughout the rest of his still sputtering up-and-down career  ( 'boogie nights' excluded ,  perhaps )  .  trust me ,  if your are not a reynolds fan ,  you will be impressed with his performance here .  john voight is his usual effortlessly accomplished self ,  and ned beatty and ronny cox both make significant contributions .  this is simply a great quartet of actors .  to conclude ,  i must speculate as to if and when 'deliverance' author james dickey's 'to the white sea' will be made .  for those that enjoyed  (  ?  )  this film ,  ttws is a similarly harrowing tale of an american air force pilot's struggle for survival after being shot down over the japanese mainland during ww2 .  it's more of the typically bleak existentialism and primordial savagery that is dickey's trademark ,  but it has all the makings of a truly spectacular ,  poetic cinematic experience .  there was the suggestion a few years ago that the coen brothers might be producing it ,  but that eventually came to nothing .  being an avid coen-o-phile it disappoints me to think what might have been had they gotten the green light on ttws ,  rather than their last couple of relatively undistinguished efforts .  returning to 'deliverance' ,  it's impossible to imagine a movie of such honest ,  unnerving brutality being made in these times ,  and that is pretty shameful .  we ,  the cinema-going public ,  are all the poorer for this . 
unlike many other films ,  which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness  ( man bites dog )  or their sheer violence  ( most peckinpah films )  ,  deliverance shocks by its plausibility .  certainly ,  the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness ,  but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads ,  both before and after everything starts to go wrong .  the moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge ,  who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with ,  let alone show any sign of human affection towards them ,  is among the most sinister in modern film .  the tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip ,  and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real .  the movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads ,  particularly ned beatty and jon voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively .  burt reynolds ,  too ,  has never been better .  the film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only get carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's tourist industry .  i can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of se7en is the best comparison i can think of .  although so much of it is excellent of itself ,  deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique . 
how can you sum up just exactly how feelgood and right and touching this film is ?  ?  for several weeks this dvd leaped off the shelf at me every time i went in the store - having seen steve carrell in a couple of films previously ,  i didn't want to smear my thought process of him - so i resisted and resisted ,  until finally i grabbed it up with a 'what the hell ! ' attitude !  and how surprised was i !  i just wish i had purchased it earlier .  having watched it three times in two days i am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters ,  yearning for that which is missing since the passing of his beloved wife ,  who thus meets an intriguing woman ,  charming her in such a profound and interesting  ( dare i say bookish ?  )  way ,  throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what he has been searching for .   the snag of that woman being his brothers girl complicates matters - which portray dan comically shy and with a heartfelt chagrin ,  seeing his  " someone special "  bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as his brothers life .  you just really begin to feel for him .   then when the blind date occurs with ruthie draper - that is the turning point in marie's estimation of dan !  !  the look she gives him when he repeats her comment ,  about not liking ruthie - sheer green-eyed monster !  triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor !  this sequence is one of the most well-crafted as dan starts to loosen up with regard to marie .   other gut-wrenching scenes - dan returns from the book and tackle shop ,  confronted by his brothers ,  begins to describe what has just occurred .  .  .  . when dan's face drops it brings a sharp intake of breath !  !   his youngest daughter lilly making the present celebrating their love for suzanne ,  his late wife ,  brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little gulp as dan realizes just what he has lost in life .   when dan plays guitar and sings at the talent show .  .  .  . his voice cracking slightly as he reprises the song .  .  .  . absolute gem !    the acceptance of what occurs late in the film by his daughters .  .  . they all three love their father and want to see him happy ,  will not let him deny his love for marie ;  the desperateness of dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock ,  their stronghold .  .  . and tell him so much more than that with just a few words .   i could go on and on but i will leave it for now - maybe return and add more comments here in the near future .  .  .  . but i will end by saying .  .  .  .    .  .  .  . if you want to watch a film that is just so damn good ,  with twists of comedy to lighten up the drama ,  that never feels forced or crass ,  that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life - not just with a woman but also with his extended family ,  then look no further .   dan in real life - 9 out of 10 for such a well-rendered cinematic experience with a score by sondre lerche ,  that intimately takes you there throughout whilst never being intrusive ,  with fine performances by the ensemble cast .  i cannot wait to re-watch this again !  ! 
this is a sublime piece of film-making .  it flows at just the right pace throughout .  the accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear .  the humorous parts are hilarious and made even more so by the largely depressingly tragic nature of the film .   however ,  despite much comment about the inherent tragedy of the storyline it was anything but depressing for me to watch .  i thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that i haven't experienced for a long time .  that is to say ,  it is superb and yet without all the common trappings of modern films such as ;  sex ,  violence and unnecessary special effects .    'dan in real life' lacks nothing for being without the regular vices .  it has a fully matured plot that just doesn't require ,  and indeed would be ruined by ,  any further embellishment .  at the same time ,  the theme is entirely adult .  it's a piece of art in and of itself that encapsulates you entirely and you want for nothing more than it already offers .   there are some scenes that feel a bit 'waltons' but these actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments .  the rosier makes way for the tragic which then gives over to the idyllic which turns to the darker etc .  this undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability .  the peaks and troughs are gentle but more than adequate in the pleasure they instill .   i highly recommend watching this film regardless of what genre you normally enjoy .  put aside any prejudices because this is a must see ! 
i watch romantic comedies with some hesitation ,  for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting .  typically in a romantic comedy ,  there is a girl and there is a guy ,  both fall in love ,  then have troubles ,  and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever .  but ,  this movie is a different story ,  it is really very different from the romantic comedies i have seen of lately .    there is a widowed guy ( dan )  ,  there is a girl ( marie )  .  dan meets marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime ,  after sometime marie has to leave .  dan develops something for her ,  and when this something starts to turn meaningful ,  we get a twist .  marie is the girlfriend of his brother .  unheeded of the circumstances ,  dan flirts with marie and realizes that he loves her ,  and even marie loves him ,  but their love would not just be possible .  how it is made possible forms the rest of the story .    steve carell performs well ,  juliette binoche is good as marie .  and every other stuff is done well .  it is a good movie ,  watch it . 
i loved the story .  somewhere ,  a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film .  well maybe there ought to be .  i thought everybody seemed really human and believable .  what a top notch cast .  what great music on the soundtrack .  what a nice this ,  and what a nice that ,  but most of all ,  i will say two words to recommend this film .   steve carell .   he really showed a nice ,  subtle depth that touched me .  he was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first ,  at the cost of denying his own needs .   did he act like a petulant ass ?  why ,  yes he did .   and you see ,  that's what was perfect about this film .  the actor who played this character made me believe he was feeling something ,  and not simply acting like he was feeling something ,  and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling ,  and what he was feeling was denied .   denied happiness .   denied fulfillment .   denied love .   losing your love is painful beyond belief ,  and many who do so will never feel something like that again .   beautiful film .   i gave it an eight out of ten . 
steve carell stars as a person who you can relate to ( sort of )  in dan in real life ,  a film which i expected not to like but ended up liking it .  not that the movie is laugh out loud funny it's just that it has a big heart .  we all like steve carell ,  this isn't what fans of the office would expect to see from him ,  but you know what ,  i liked this movie .    carell stars as dan burns ,  a widowed father who's daughters don't really like him .  one weekend ,  him and his daughters travel down to see his family .  while there ,  he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman .  when he gets back to his house ,  he finds out that his brother mitch ( played by dane cook )  is dating this woman ( played by juliette binoche )  .   dan in real life ,  at times ,  i found a bit unbelievable .  are the burns family really the kind of people who do exercises together and play board games together and do a bunch of other family things ?  i would highly doubt that .  i don't know any family who is like that .  is that stopping me from giving it a thumbs up ?  no .   dan in real life : ***/****
clean family oriented movie .  i laughed ,  i cried .  .  . i loved it .  i was worried i wouldn't be able to see steve carrell as anything but goofy michael from the office .  boy ,  was i wrong .  he should win an oscar for his performance .  i will definitely buy this on dvd when it comes out .  my husband enjoyed it and he isn't into movies of this  " type "  .  i saw it with 2 other couples in the 30 year old range and we all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest .  only 1 cuss word !  not even sure why it was pg13 .  i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy ,  drama ,  romance and more ! 
i loved  " dan in real life "  .  a wonderful journey-to-love story like you've got mail or while you were sleeping ,  but not ridiculously full of sight gags and crude jokes ,  and not so romantic it makes you wanna throw up .    dan burns  ( steven carrell )  is a popular advice columnist who can't seem to get things in his own life straightened out .  until one day ,  on a family gathering/trip ,  he meets and instantly connects with marie  ( the always beautiful juliette binoche ) a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed in a hazy filter hearkening back to the starlets of classic cinema .  chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffin ,  but marie must be off for a previous engagement ,  and they must part ways .    later we are treated to dan's tight-knit ,  fun-loving relatives who not only have big breakfasts together but also enjoy using the intelligent and sweetly dorky dan as the butt of many bachelor jokes .  what i liked so much was that although the family's characteristics could be seen as obnoxious to some ,  i thought it was a great portrayal of a big family that doesn't venture into parody or crude exaggeration .  the burns family is simply a close ,  loving group of people who are truly interested in the best for dan .  there are wonderfully awkward family moments that aren't unrealistic .  the family is nosey ,  but never mean-spirited or gossipy ;  quirky ,  but never outlandish .   and then dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend he's brought to the family gathering .  and thus begins a roller-coaster of restrained longing and funny love-budding .    i could go on but i just thought this movie was simply awesome .  it's not particularly  " hip "  or  " clever "  ,  never too wordy and obsessed with dry humor or biting wit as many comedies are in modern cinema .  there is a nice balance of storytelling visuals and funny-but-real dialogue .  in fact ,  early in the movie ,  the initial spark of love begins with whimsical discussion in a classic hollywood-style conversation where the characters say what they're thinking out loud .   so i've probably rambled and repeated myself ,  but i highly recommend  " dan in real life "  .  it's a great date movie ,  trust me ,  you'll laugh ,  and only if you're a geek like me you'll get a bit teary-eyed .  filled with fun and magical love ,   " dan in real life "  won't disappoint .   =================== 3 . 5 out of 4 stars grade :  a
the widower family man dan burns  ( steve carell )  writes the column  " dan in real life "  giving advices for families in the new jersey standard and raises his three daughters alone .  jane  ( allison pill )  ,  the older ,  has just got her driving license but dan does not allow her to drive ;  cara  ( brittany robertson )  has a crush on his high-school mate marty ;  and the young lily  ( marlene lawston )  misses her mother .  when dan and his daughters travel to rhode island for a family reunion ,  he meets marie  ( juliette binoche )  in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other .  they feel attracted for each other ,  but marie receives a phone call and leaves dan ,  giving her phone number first .  dan immediately falls in love for marie ,  but when he return to his parent's home ,  he finds that marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother mitch burns  ( dane cook )  ,  who is also in love with her .  along the weekend ,  the attraction between the clumsy dan and marie increases and they have to take a decision .    " dan in real life "  is a great surprise and a delightful movie ,  with comedy ,  romance and drama .  the chemistry of the gorgeous juliette binoche and steve carell is awesome and it is very easy to know why everybody loves marie .  the trio allison pill ,  brittany robertson and marlene lawston is fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story .  the screenplay is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are stunning ,  with a realistic behavior of a family meeting .  follow the advice of dan's column and plan to be surprised with the reunion of the burns' family .  my vote is eight .   title  ( brazil )  :   " eu ,  meu irmão e nossa namorada "   (  " me ,  my brother and our girlfriend "  ) 
steve carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices ,  family and pressure .  by judging on the plot and cover art of the movie i was expecting a flat-out comedy ,  lots of laughs and unrealistic elements ,  but i guess i was wrong .  sure the movie had some comedy ,  but it felt much more of a light drama to me and steve carell once again gave a great performance .  the movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element i found .  but ,  the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable .  through-out ,  the cinematography was great ,  the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important .  though ,  it came down to old ,  flat and predictable ending .  i'd reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie  ( perhaps for the bad ,  even )  this movie would get better publicity .  still a fun movie . 
dan ,  the widowed father of three girls ,  has his own advice column that will probably go into syndication .  after his wife's death ,  he has taken time to raise his daughters .  having known no romance in quite some time ,  nothing prepares him for the encounter with the radiant marie ,  at a local book store in a rhode island small town on the ocean ,  where he has gone to celebrate thanksgiving with the rest of his big family .  after liking marie at first sight ,  little prepares him when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound .  after all ,  she is the date of dan's brother ,  mitch .   it is clear from the outset that dan and marie are made for one another ,  and although we sense what the outcome will be ,  we go for the fun ride that peter hedges ,  the director wants to give us .  mr .  hedges ,  an author and screenplay writer on his own ,  has given us two excellent novels ,   " what's eating gilber grapes "  ,  and  " an ocean in iowa "  ,  and the delightful indie ,   " pieces of april ,  which he also directed .  it's just a coincidence that both movies deal with families during thanksgiving reunions .   the best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars ,  steve carell and juliette binoche .  mr .  carell ,  in fact ,  keeps getting better all the time .  in many ways ,  he remind us of jack lemmon ,  in his take of comedy and serious material .  what can one say about ms .  binoche ,  an intelligent actress ,  and a bright presence in any film .  she proves she is right up to doing comedy ,  convincing us about her marie .   the only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture .  john mahoney ,  diane wiest ,  norbert leo butz ,  jessica hecht ,  emily blunt ,  allison pill ,  amy ryan ,  have nothing to do .  they just serve as incidental music for decoration .  dane cook ,  who is seen as brother mitch ,  fares better because he gets to recite more lines than the others .    " dan in real life "  is a delightful film that will please everyone . 
i was drawn to dan in real life from the excellent reviews and the thirst for a dramedy that was well written-thank you peter hedges-and because when steve carell stars in the film ,  you know an audience is going to find like in little miss sunshine ,  a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding .  dan in real life delivered that promise .   the film is so real to many families world wide that have lost a member and yet have gone on with their lives in search of something that will give them the magic back before their loss .  with steve carell and the wondrous juliette binoche ,  their relationship was so beautifully done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and to their journeys .  the cast ,  sets and story made dan in real life one to remember as we head into the holidays ahead . 
i saw a special advance screening of this today .  i have to let you know ,  i'm not a huge fan of either dane cook or steve carell ,  so i really had no expectations going into this .  i ended up enjoying it quite a bit .   dan in real life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family .  while at a bookstore ,  he meets the woman of his dreams ,  only to find out that she happens to be his brother's girlfriend .   this movie is pretty well made- the soundtrack ,  cinematography ,  and acting are all top-notch ,  especially steve carell .  my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development ,  mostly with dane cook's character .  we never really get a close look at the relationship between dane and steve's characters ,  and i felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what dan's inner conflict about being in love with dane's girlfriend was like .  other than this though ,  dan in real life is definitely a solid ,  sweet film- definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we've been getting this year . 
as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years ,  whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions ,  it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other .  that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge ,  merchant and money lender in 19th century london .   as his nephew points out to his uncle ,  he doesn't keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug .  the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago ,  he's a hard case ,  a whole lot like his 20th century counterpart ,  mr .  potter of bedford falls ,  new york .   but as charles dickens told this tale ,  redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him how .   a christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century great britain as oliver twist was .  the characters in this film are middle and lower class .  the cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in oliver twist ,  but they are having to struggle to stay up there .  still love and happiness radiate their home ,  no thanks to the guy bob cratchit works for .    like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much ,  ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world .   patrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge .  but george c .  scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film .  the meanness of him ,  but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change .  scott joins a fine tradition of people like reginald owen and alastair sim who've both done great interpretations of scrooge .   among the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob cratchit and edward woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of christmas present .    according to imdb this is one of 32 versions of a christmas carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best . 
there is a scene in dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first .  the answer to one of the clues is murphy's law :  anything that can go wrong ,  will go wrong .  this is exactly the case for dan burns  ( steve carell ,  the office )  a columnist for the local newspaper .  dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life ,  yet he comes to realize that things aren't so picture perfect in his own .  dan in real life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy ,  tragedy ,  and beauty of them all .  besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious .   the death of his wife forces dan to raise his three daughters all on his own .  .  .  each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life :  the first one anxious to try out her drivers license ,  the middle one well into her teenage angst phase ,  and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood .  things take a turn for dan when he goes to rhode island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore .   her name is marie  ( juliette binoche ,  chocolat )  and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations .  .  .  which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the burns family household .   if you've seen steve carell in the office or little miss sunshine ,  you'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well .  steve carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life :  the frustration and sincere compassion .  the family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax .  the movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes ,  yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability :  which is an irony within itself .   dan in real life is definitely worth seeing ,  for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life ,  and i'll most likely enjoy it a second time ,  or even a third .  just  " put it on my tab .  " 
i'm not a steve carell fan however i like this movie about dan ,  an advice columnist ,  who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend .  its a story thats been told before ,  but not like this .  there are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be .  the cast is wonderful ,  and even if carell is not my cup of tea ,  he is quite good as the widower who's suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you .  at times witty and wise in the way that an annoying hallmark card can be ,  the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film .  worth a look see
and possibly closest to the dickens story line .  although i find the young ebenezer hard to watch  ( who's idea was that period hair ,  surely they could have done better than that !  )  ,  scott does an incredible job as scrooge .  his delivery of some of the lines from dickens finally brought it to life for me .  edward woodward is everything we expect and more of the ghost of christmas present .  i find g . c .  scott's scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by patrick stewart .  the scene christmas morning when scrooge realizes he hasn't 'missed it' ,  is enough to convince one that scott knows how to act versus overact .  he's phenomenal here .  nearly the entire cast is incredible .  the tiny tim in this version of the christmas carol is a little tough to look at ,  almost too sweet .  still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday .  enjoy ! 
steve carell plays dan burns ,  newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls .  at a large family homecoming dan meets his perfect woman ,  only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother .   what's a man to do ?   i rather liked  " dan in real life "  ,  but i would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept steve carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained ,  rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful .  if you cannot accept it ,  fear not ,   " get smart "  will be along later in the year ,  but for the record i thought he was very good .    " dan in real life "  starts off like your typical ,  incidentally amusing ,  family drama ,  but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and carell's frustration with his situation grows .  it's not massively original  ( but if you only saw movies with original ideas ,  cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed ,  wouldn't they ?  )  ,  but  " dan in real life "  is entertaining ,  and a good cast  ( who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous juliette binoche ?  )  make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love .   i hope that steve carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again . 
marie :  you are smooth .  dan :  no ,  i'm not smooth .  i'm dan .   if you're anything like me ,  smooth and single do not go together .  you see someone you like ,  rare enough as that can be ,  and you want to say something but you don't .  or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you've ever said in your life .  more often then not though ,  you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life  a risk .  you can't blame a guy for being a little frightened though .  maybe he's been burned hard before or maybe he's trying to focus all his energy on his career .  there are reasons ,  some valid ,  some not ,  and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason .  you tell yourself you don't need it or it isn't the right time for you but you still wish it were happening .  any way you break it down ,  it's not easy .  sound familiar ?  if you thought yes even just a little ,  then dan in real life ,  the new comedy from director peter hedges ,  is a must-see .  it will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once .   the dan from the title is dan burns  ( steve carell )  ,  an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced ,  fulfilling and morally uplifting life .  four years or so before the film opens on dan waking up to his day ,  he lost his wife and love of his life .  after that tragedy ,  dan was left to raise their three daughters alone .  between that and focusing on his career ,  finding love again was not one of dan's priorities .  and so he became more functional than feeling .  removed from the power of intimacy ,  dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again .  that is ,  until he meets marie  ( juliette binoche )  in a book and tackle shop in connecticut on a quiet morning .  they're interaction is casual ,  comfortable and it catches both of them off guard .  there is only one problem really .  she is already seeing someone .  unfortunately for all involved ,  that someone is dan's brother ,  mitch  ( dane cook )  .  his entire family has come up to their parents' country home for their yearly visit and dan must now spend the weekend pining and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with marie that morning .  it only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to awaken dan's heart from its coma .   with so many family members to deal with  ( jack mahoney and dianne wiest are at the helm )  ,  dan in real life does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time .  while the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for dan ,  hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract ,  with the presumption that it would ultimately make for a more complete film .  luckily ,  hedges has got carell to carry the heavy burden .  it is a pleasure to watch steve carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes  ( despite the occasional evan almighty-sized misstep )  .  he is charismatic ,  charming and obviously a sharp humorist .  as dan ,  he is also self-deprecating ,  awkward and scared .  carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona .  perhaps more importantly ,  he is entirely relatable as dan .  whether he's flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen ,  unable to stan d still in his anxiety ,  dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd .  carell gives dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time .   i wondered after seeing the film if i enjoyed the it as much as i did ,  despite its slight shortcomings  ( juliette binoche  i know you might like to lighten up every now and then but i don't recommend it unless there is chocolate involved )  ,  because of where i am in my life .  would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film ?  i can't say .  what i can say ,  as someone who knows what it means to be lonely ,  dan in real life knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished .  it also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen . 
i was lucky enough to see this at a pre-screening last night  ( oct .  20 )  and i was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and genuinely heart felt acting .   while the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new ,  the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh ,  unique ,  and distinctly  " indy "  in style .  it isn't something that can easily be compared to films of the past ,  it's a unique take on a sort of classic middle-aged depressed love story .   i was particularly struck by the casting of the film .  down to every last extra in the family ,  it was a beautiful and talented cast .  the three daughters did a wonderful job ,  the talent was evenly dispersed between them and none of them  " out-shone "  the other two .   it was truly a delightful film ,  appropriate for all ages and laugh out loud funny while also being truly touching and heart warming .  it was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films . 
i got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it .  it's not the typical romantic comedy .  i can't remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it .  the laughs aren't gags here--they're observations ,  laughs of recognition ,  little shocks of  " oh ,  my god ,  i thought i was the only one who felt that way !  "  i won't give away the plot ,  which is more than just  " guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend .  "  the whole family plays a part in the relationship here .  probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since  " while you were sleeping .  "    steve carell goes much deeper than he's gone before ,  and for the first time i really liked him .  the cast is amazing ,  a list of veteran theater actors whom i've loved in other roles ,  but they blend to make a convincing family .  dianne wiest is lovely as the mother ,  juliette binoche is luminous and hilarious  ( who knew she was funny ?  )  ,  and even the reviled dane cook gives a warm ,  quiet ,  touching performance .  the sondre lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition ,  and i'll buy the cd the second it's available .   don't miss this one . 
the most satisfying element about  " dan in real life "  is that the relationship between dan  ( steve carell )  and marie  ( juliette binoche )  makes sense and is beautifully realistic .  the casting of oscar-winner juliette binoche as dan's love interest was a superb decision ;  she is exceptionally talented ,  intelligent ,  naturally attractive and ,  thank goodness ,  appropriately aged for the part !  had this movie been made with jessica alba or scarlett johansson ,  it would have been a disaster .   another wonderful aspect about  " dan in real life "  is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the  " frat pack "  formula :  dumb chicks ,  chauvinistic guys ,  and sleazy jokes .   " dan in real life "  is witty and has fun ,  intelligent laughs throughout .  whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing ,  the jokes from  " dan in real life "  are more natural and clever ,  and involve some thinking on the part of the audience .   my only problem with  " dan in real life "  is that the rebellious ,  middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress brittany robertson .  it's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director .  either way ,  her character is unrealistic and annoying .  but ,  this is only a minor flaw in the film ,  and does not take away from the story as a whole .   all in all ,   " dan in real life "  is a great film ,  a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies .  the quality of the writing ,  directing ,  acting ,  and  ( especially )  cinematography is excellent .  it is simply a beautiful ,  light-hearted comedy . 
for romance's sake ,  as a married man .  the following two films are recommended .   1 .  brief encounter by david lean  ( 1945 )  ,  uk  well ,  when a woman goes to a railway station ,  something may happen .  and it happened !  how she longed to be there ,  in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams .  but she was married .  .  .  the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman  2 .  xiao cheng zhi chun by fei mu  ( 1948 )  ,  china  well ,  when a woman goes to the market to buy fish ,  grocery and medicine ,  passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town ,  there is much to think about ,  about the melancholy of her life ,  her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future .  .  . just when a jubilant young doctor arrived ,  something happened .  .  .  the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman  in both movies ,  from great directors of uk and china ,  the passion vs restraint was so intense ,  yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts .  that leaves you with a great after-taste ,  sniffing it intensely without biting it . 
this is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships .   eventually they do become spoken ,  but is there a chance to change anything about the situation .   originally made in shanghai 1948 and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the dai family .  there is still some weight about the history that surrounds the family .  history usually has weight in chinese literature and serious film .   a young married couple - liyan ,  an invalid ,  and his wife yuwen live in a once great family compound that is partially ruined .   a bright contrast is liyan's young sister who cannot really remember the past of the family but accepts everything in quite a natural way .  her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved .   into this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitor .  .  .   i ended up feeling quite sad - but definitely a superior film . 
this is a nice little movie with a nice story ,  that plays the most important role in the entire movie .   it's a quite intriguing dramatic story ,  with also romance present in it .  the story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up .  the characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors .  normally i'm not a too big fan of the asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good .   of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies ,  produced in the west .  in a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era .   i only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better .  for a movie that is considered a kind of an art-house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences .  this was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically .  not that this is a bad thing ,  it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre .   but oh well ,  this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it .  in that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint .   8/10
tian's remake is no good at all .  i only click on his remake documentary to see wei wei ,  the original actress back in the classic 1948 film say a few words to the crew .  we are going to meet wei wei this sunday  ( 28/3/2010 )  after the showing of xiao cheng zhi chun in the hong kong film archiev .  wei wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair ,  her cameo appearance in hong kong films is always a surprise to her fans .  in this year's hong kong film festival ,  a special program is dedicated to fei mu ,  director of this epic movie and wei wei's still shot from the movie is being seen all around in hong kong .  my son ,  who turns 21 this year ,  is surprised wei wei was so beautiful then . 
mature intelligent and highly charged melodrama unbelivebly filmed in china in 1948 .  wei wei's stunning performance as the catylast in a love triangle is simply stunning if you have the oppurunity to see this magnificent film take it
this is simply one of the finest renditions of dicken's classic tale .  the script very accurately follows the story originally penned by dickens ,  and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere .  viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choice .   george c .  scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge ,  and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts .  i found that he was able to win me over to the point where i sympathized with the old miser ,  something rarely done in other versions .  the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production ,  which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen . 
xiao chen zhi chun is a great movie ,  not only in the year it was shot but also now .  it's an art movie which is not outdated even in 21st century .  the director maintained a good narrative skill and thus made the story so smooth !   the movie reminds me of the later french new wave movie :  francois truffaut's  " femme d'a cote "  which is of the similar topic . 
henri verneuil represented the commercial cinema in france from 1960-1980 .  always strong at the box-office ,  and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies ,  mafia score-settling and world war ii battles ,  verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on saturday night .  he worked with the cream of the male actors of his day :  gabin ,  belmondo ,  fernandel ,  delon ,  sharif ,  anthony quinn .  i .  .  .  comme icare is the only time he directed yves montand .  it's an oddly static film ,  taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms ,  containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence .   montand gives a good performance ,  if somewhat dry ,  and he is well supported by the other actors .  i couldn't help wondering what costa-gavras could have done with this story ,  on the basis of z  ( the lambrakis assassination )  and l'aveu  ( the torture of artur london in czechoslovakia by stalinists )  . 
this is a must see for anybody who loves thriller's specially political thriller .  one scene that stands out is milgram experiment it is shot to perfection very rarely do we get to see a movie shot and scripted the way this movie is presented .   the movie starts with a kennedy like assassination and a three member team is constituted to investigate the assassination .  however one of the member does not agree with the final findings of the committee .  as per the terms set that member would initiate a one man investigation into the assassination .  this investigation gets him involved in into to deep and dark secrets of high office politics and the way they are controlled . 
this movie i saw some 10 years ago  ( maybe more )  ,  i took it in a rental and never found it to buy even in french sites .  the end is very surprising and intelligent .  i would like very much to watch it again because i think it's as surpring as the sixth sense althogh a completely different kind of movie . 
i saw this film for the very first time several years ago - and was hooked up in an instant .  it is great and much better than j .  f .  k .  cause you always have to think 'can it happen to me ?  can i become a murderer ? ' you cannot turn of the tv or your vcr without thinking about the plot and the end ,  which you should'nt miss under any circumstances . 
finally a thriller which omits the car chases ,  explosions and other eye catching effects .  the movie combines a simple plot  ( assasination of a french president )  with an excellent background .  it takes a look behind mans behavior with authorities ,  and explains why we would obey almost every order  ( even murder )  which would be given to us .   furthermore it shows us how secret services can manipulate the run of history and how hardly they can be controlled .  the best thing on this movie is ,  that there is no classic  " hollywood end "  which can easily be predicted . 
the first time i saw this film ,  i was in shock for days afterwards .  its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention ,  helped by good acting and some really intriguing music .  the ending ,  quite simply ,  had me gasping .  first rate ! 
highly memorable ,  intelligent and suspenseful movie from one of french movies' true geniuses ,  the formidably able henri verneuil .  the plot is an exact parallel of the jfk assassination ,  and takes place in a non-descript ,  fictional country .  the film ,  visually as well as plot-wise ,  is razor-sharp .  shot with meticulous precision ,  it follows henry volnay ,  the procuror who takes on himself to unravel the coup .  in many ways ,  it's a very disturbing movie ,  not the least for the cold and analytical precision of its comment on a so-called modern state's inner workings .  the atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable ,  and verneuil left nothing to chance in its tight plotting .  on another level ,  this relatively little-known movie just had a 15 years head-start on oliver stone ,  who was acclaimed for the  " jfk "  movie ,  a inferior film in many areas ,  the least of which not being credibility .  .  .   it's a masterpiece ,  any cinema lover should see it ,  preferably in its original french version with subs . 
i'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made .  the story takes place in a fictional state ,  but obviously it deals with the murder of kennedy .  a truthful and honest district attorney  ( played by yves montand )  does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man daslow  ( =oswald )  and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team .   the screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end .  just the part dealing with the milgram experiment about authorities is  ( though not uninteresting )  a bit out of place .  the ending sequence - explaining who icarus really is - partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence i have ever seen in a movie . 
first time i saw this movie was in the eighties ,  but reviewed now this thriller is still actual .  some newer movies focus on similar topics ,  but they do not match this french milestone .   a president - obviously jf kennedy - gets shot in an open car during a public appearance .  the resulting huge investigation finds the  " lee harvey oswald "  figure of this movie guilty ,  but one member of the jury insists in further inquiry .  he reveals some surprising evidence  .  .  .   unlike oliver stone's jfk - a movie with the same plot - this one does not play with emotions ,  but concentrates in a exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together ,  drawing a new picture of the assassination .  even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene .  compared to jfk this movie is more reasonable ,  intelligent and thrilling .  parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies ,  i had a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema .    " i .  .  .  comme icare "  is a  " must see "  .  its unique and brilliant ,  and the music by ennio morricone is wonderful .  this movie deserves a very good ranking ,  if it was a hollywood production it would be famous for sure .   
henri verneuil's film may be not so famous as parallax view ,  3 days of the condor or jfk but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre .  action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed .  after several years of investigation ,  special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman .  but one man - prosecutor volney ,  played by yves montand - thinks there's something more to be investigated and so the film starts .  this movie doesn't deal with some exact theories ,  but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in today's world .  such film could be made only in the 1970-ies but it will never lose it's actuality .  furthermore ,  it's even a bit frightful how precise are it's oracles .  10 out of 10 . 
this film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons .  the co-ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments .  robert ginty and fred williamson have a memorable scene together near the end ,  where williamson says to ginty ,   " you sure do get around buddy boy !  "  .  i did enjoy this film only for ginty and williamson ,  but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad-libbed most likely .  a film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so .  it seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film ,  maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look .  the one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent ,  so that tripled with fred williamson and robert ginty make for a film worth seeing . 
white fire has so much going for it .  with larry bird look-alike robert ginty leading the charge blazing away with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache ,  the movie soars above other low-budget actioners .  the charisma he has in this makes tom selleck look like a putz .  with ginty beating up everyone ,  the movie only rises in awesomeness when a story of diamond intrigue enters into play .  then add in fred williamson ,  some frontal bush ,  chainsaw attacks and some awesome incest themes .  .  .  . this flick ends up delivering on all cylinders .  if you're looking for some awesome b-action ,  this is where it's at .  now ,  if i can just get my hands on that soundtrack . 
white fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate dvd releases and on vhs .  he claimed it's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made .  i generally don't watch movies knowing that they're going to be bad ,  but i made an exception for this one .  .  .  and i was very glad that i did .   it's filled to the brim with action  ( much of it surprisingly ,  graphically gory )  ,  sleaze  ( isolated to nudity with a key female character ,  but there's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious )  and outrageously awkward dialogue ,  all of which adds to the laughter-inducing tone of the film .   ginty ,  the unusual looking star of the exterminator  ( and countless other low budget action turds )  is amusing in the lead ,  giving the best performance he could muster .  williamson is better than usual ,  clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee  ( and he doesn't come in until midway through )  .  the rest of the cast is also fun to watch ,  particularly the villains ,  one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish-mash of spanish and italian .  she's priceless .   again ,  i can't stress enough how gory it was .  it's not so bloody that it's nauseating ,  but it's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget .  also ,  when ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys ,  he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers .   don't miss white fire .  it's a rollicking - if mind-numbingly stupid - action classic . 
superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80's exploitation ,  hooray !  the pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama ,  but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles ,  rough fist-fights ,  lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity !  bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship .  can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister's naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes ?  well ,  bo does that to his sister and ,  judging by her dubbed laughter ,  she doesn't mind at all .  sick ,  dude !  anyway ,  as kids they fled from russia with their parents ,  but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy .  a friendly smuggler took custody over them ,  however ,  and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers .  when the actual plot lifts off ,  20 years later ,  they're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine .  very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of  " white fire "  ,  but it sure is a lot of fun to watch .  most of the time you have no clue who's beating up who or for what cause  ( and i bet the actors understood even less )  but whatever !  the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded .  the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and i won't reveal for what reason  bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes .  bo's principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent ,  the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film ,  there's the obligatory  " we're-falling-in-love "  montage and loads of other attractions !  my god ,  what a brilliant experience .  the original french title translates itself as  " life to survive "  ,  which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie :  none ! 
what can you say about the film white fire .  amazing ?  fantastic ?  disturbing ?  hilarious ?  these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire .  from wobbly ,  garbled beginning to profound end ,  this movie will entertain throughout .   our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world .  a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms .  when the father separates from the mother and their childen ,  you get a real sense of what kind of movie you're about to watch .  father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit ,  and is polite as he gets people's attention before he shoots them ,  but alas ,  dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised ,  unsafe stunt .  meanwhile ,  mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them .  he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre  " halt !  "  ,  and then promptly wastes the mother .  this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred .   so now we fast forward about 20 years  ( 30 if you're honest about the hero's age )  to beautiful turkey ,  where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves ,  or diamond prospectors ,  or something .  ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods ,  while bo  ( masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty )  drives around the desert in his denim outfits .  bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship .  they don't seem to have any friends other than each other ,  and they spend all of their time together .  that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as  " you know its a shame you're my sister "  he says to her while she's stark naked ,  make for a very dynamic duo .  bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed ,  as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf .  a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid ,  and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid .  this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong .  bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas ,  and he is overjoyed with his new love .   so anyway ,  there's a lot of fun action scenes ,  ridiculous violence ,  great acting ,  impossible to follow plot-lines ,  fred  " the hammer "  williamson  ( for some reason )  ,  and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond  ( which later explodes )  .  all of these things are great ,  but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special .  .  .  . really special .  so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire .  you may be glad you did .  . or not . 
absolutely fantastic trash .  .  .  . this one has it all :  nudity ,  good fight scenes ,  gore ,  action ,  explosions etc .  it also stars the wonderful belinda mayne as ingrid - not olga as the other reviewer pointed out - although olga turns into ingrid later on in the film  ( you'll have to watch it to see what i mean )  .   i won't bother to go into the story as it's far too long winded and not very interesting .  the relationship between ingrid and her brother bo  ( robert ginty )  is interesting - watch the towel stealing scene to see what i mean .   the fight scenes were at once quite good and then spoilt by some really shoddy gore effects that looked like they were done by the team who did city of the walking dead  ( i . e .  strange coloured blood gushing out of neck wounds )  .   i'd advise fans of low budget trash to check it out if they can track down a copy - its pretty rare though and i couldn't ever see anyone bothering to re-release it so it'll become all the rarer in a few years .   anyway i'd recommend it solely for belinda mayne's great nude scenes !  that lady's a fox ! 
 " painting is seeing ,  then remembering better than you saw .  "  so says dick heldar  ( ronald colman )  ,  the painter in the light that failed . the movie is in the grand old hollywood style ,  starring ronald colman and a bravura supporting cast that includes ida lupino in her first important role ,  dependable character actor dudley digges  ( who also co-starred with colman in condemned .  )  , and a solid performance by the wonderful actor walter huston .   the title and opening sequences of the film pretty much give away the fact that dick will lose his sight .  he's blinded by gun powder discharge as he and childhood sweetheart maisie  ( muriel angelus )  are playing with a pistol .  later a wound while fighting in the sudan is the catalyst for his blindness .  he becomes a famous painter ,  but he's already blinded by ambition ,  and doesn't really reach his full potential until the point that his sight is leaving him .  enter bad girl bessie  ( ida lupino )  ,  and his self destruction is set in motion .  lupino is very powerful in this role and plays off colman very well .  her evil tart reminds me of bette davis in of human bondage .    well acted and well directed ,  this is one of my favorite colman melodramas . 
 " telefilms "  tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule ,  which is why this film always tends to buck the trend .   george c .  scott embodies ebenezer scrooge perfectly ,  fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies ,  and still makes him a simpathetic character .  the production value for this film was exceptional ,  never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage set-ups ,  yet relying on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and strong backdrops .  a movie that certainly stands alone . 
a boy and a girl is chased by a local warrior because the boy killed  ( by accident )  the warriors father  ( or whoever he was )  .  and they travel through the nature of africa's most ruff areas .   the acting in this movie isn't that good  ( except for that elephant kid )  .  but it's a very good adventure and it's not very censored ,  there is some blood ,  flesh and nudity  ( which lighten up the movie a bit )  .   i give this movie a 7 because of it's picture of the african nature and it's action . 
i saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of jennifer mccomb .  it was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course mccomb .  at that time i was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards i am trying for vcd of this film but i am unable to find it .  huge african lions makes appearance int his film and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animals and grace of them .  all section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film .  but some scenes involving mccomb forces parental guidance for this film .  it is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all . 
i had seen this movie when it got released ,  and when i was 12 years old  :  )  and i still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the hero/heroine escape every time when faced with danger  :  )  and the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain !  i think many so-called action movies copied a lot many  " escape scenes "  from this movie !  !  and not only does it never impress me when i see such copying ,  it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece !   :  )  the lead actors have acted wonderfully .  the slow and realistic development of the chemistry b/w the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed .  as children ,  we felt that the love that developed b/w them was very natural  :  )  the way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love ,  sacrifice and caring .  i recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance !  !  --vijay . 
i liked this movie very much .  although this movie doesn't boast of big  ( or even known )  names ,  its very charming .  its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gonna be just fine in the end .  my favorite scene is with the baby elephant part .  i rate this movie at 7 . 5
a bit slow and boring ,  the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman ,  the brothers sitting on the porch ,  the wealthy cigar smoking man .  the photography of the river is marvelous ,  as is the interior period decoration .  if you like decoration of banana republic stores ,  this is a must . 
as many people know ,  mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called golden age of the mexican cinema ,  fortunately ,  during the late 90's ,  and early 21st century ,  great movies like la ley de herodes ,  bajo california ,  amores perros ,  y tu mamá también and ,  of course ,  el coronel no tiene quien le escriba ,  appeared .  el coronel .  .  .  ,  is a wonderful movie ,  that retells the classic story by gabriel garcía márquez ,  by eliminating the magic realism elements ,  and replacing them with the crude reality lived in mexico ,  not only by people like the colonel ,  who wait for their pensions ,  but by more than the half of the mexican population ,  who live in complete poverty .  the film's characters ,  satirically represent classic characters found in mexican society ,  such as the nationalist colonel ,  the cold and even ambitious priest ,  the hypocrite ,  but at the same time loyal compadre ,  the tolerant and patient wife ,  the hidden homosexual ,  etc .  this movie ,  is a must-see if you want to know more about mexican society ,  and specially ,  if you want to watch a gorgeous movie ,  by one of mexico's finest directors
this is a truly magnificent and heartwrenching film !  !  !  !  ripstein's locations are spectacular ,  extremely detailed and well lit ,  the dialogue is extraordinarily garcía márquez ,  no doubt about it .  fernando luján and marisa paredes give us outstanding performances as the colonel and his wife .   you must see it !  !  ! 
a sober ,  reflexive piece ,  a little miniature which blossoms into a magnificent humane pictorial sequence which goes beyond a mere dramatization for the screen .  this quiet little story will hold you enthralled - if you do not have too many problems with the various spanish accents ranging from mexican to peruvian ,  and marisa paredes' more authentic iberian peninsular usage !  garcíadiego has accomplished a perfect adaptation from the novel :  even the grand maestro garcía márquez should be proud of her superb work .  and hats off to arturo ripstein who has so ably concerted the whole effort into a gem ,  a ruby ,  and so refined ,  so elegant ,  so sensitive ,  so touchingly .  .  .  .  .   el coronel - fernando luján - is waiting to get his pension ,  while he continues to live in his ramshackle timber dwelling deep in the colombian jungle  ( however ,  filmed elsewhere ,  not in colombia )  with his fighting cock and his wife  ( in that order ?  )  .  and that is all there is to it .   but ,  oh ,  so much more .  .  .  .  this film is a rhapsody .   i must see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible .  worth the high side of 8 out of 10 ,  which is very high on my scale .   this is not light commercial hollywood stuff . 
the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed pension .  ripstein's lyrical work is a sweet ode to all those who ,  like the colonel ,  suffer under the abuses of a cynical and hardened society that strengthens itself by denying its citizens the means to live with dignity and purpose .  unlike the absurdity of waiting for godot ,  the colonel's wait for the arrival of his pension gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life .  two things in the film drive the colonel who is masterfully played by fernando lujan ;  the hope that his military pension will one day arrive and the knowledge that his son ,  agustin ,  died for a noble cause ,  a reason other than a drunken fracas at a rigged cockfight .  unable to realize the former ,  and forced to prove to the world the latter ,  the colonel does the only thing he can do ,  set about training his son's fighting cock .  the cock is now the warrior who can bring fortune and justice to the colonel and his asthmatic wife ,  but his fighting ring is that of the killer of his former owner ,  agustin .  in a tense scene of confrontation between the colonel and nogales ,  his son's killer ,  the colonel is offered by nogales ,  a paid government agent ,  money enough to equal the colonel's full pension .  but ,  this is blood money ;  hush money designed to hide the fact that those in power have turned their backs on one who fought for their political ideals ,  and to conceal to the world that the warrior colonel's son was assassinated because he wrote for an underground paper that favored the rights of labor unions and the common man .  with maximum dignity ,  the colonel rejects nogales' offer ,  picks up his fighting rooster and walks away as nobly as his old legs can carry him .  once he is at home ,  dona lola ,  his scolding wife ,  wants to know why the colonel refused the money when both of them are starving .  in response to her continued question ,   " what are we going to eat until november  ( when the cockfighting season begins )  "  ,  the colonel responds ,   " shit .  "  excrement is what the poor and disenfranchised have been eating all of their lives ,  and excrement is a meal that the colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity ,  knowing that he could never sell his soul to those who oppress him .  the colonel waits as the only man of honor and valor in a world without principles . 
in a poor village in mexico ,  the colonel  ( fernando luján )  lives with his asthmatic wife lola  ( marisa paredes )  in an old house .  lola still grieves the death of their son augustin some time ago .  the colonel has been expecting for his pension of fighter in a war against catholic church for almost twenty-seven years .  however ,  for political reasons ,  the present government wants to forget this old fight .  without having any possession or money ,  but a valuable gamecock ,  they struggle to survival with the expectation of the acknowledgement letter from the government ,  recognizing the law and paying for the delayed pension .  this slow and touching movie reflects the social and financial situation of most of the elder retired persons in third world countries .  in brazil ,  most of the retired persons has to survive with about us$ 80 , 00 per month .  the debts of the colonel in the story were made to pay for a graveyard for his son ,  otherwise he would be buried as an indigent .  outstanding performance of the cast ,  in a very sad story that is reality in the poor countries .  my vote is eight .    title  ( brazil )  :   ( `não se escreve ao coronel' )   ( do not write to the colonel )   
wow ,  this movie was absolutely brilliant .  i really don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace .  i thought the pace was perfect .  the movie is about michael sullivan played by tom hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit-man/ killer working for john rooney  ( paul newman )  .  he disslikes this job but does it because rooney payed for his house and helps him financially .  he had nothing and mr .  rooney gave him everything .  but ,  his children are unaware that this is his job ,  and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him ,  he is placed in an awkward position .  and when an atrocity occurs ,  he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge .  they rob abanks and much more and build a bond .  they're the perfect team .  hanks does a great job as always as well as jude law who plays his creepy role to perfection .  this drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were . 
the setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of dickens' classic tale .  george c .  scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast .  his scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie .  then his character changes to one who is truly repentant .  the 19th century english town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film .  it is a movie i watch every christmas along with the real grinch and it's a wonderful life . 
in the winter of 1931 ,  supposedly 12-year-old tyler hoechlin  ( as michael sullivan jr .  )  wonders what his mobster father tom hanks  ( michael  " mike "  sullivan )  does for a living .  young hoechlin follows mr .  hanks to  " work "  one evening ,  and witnesses him blasting away some rival gangsters .  this leads - in a very roundabout way - to  " godfather " -type paul newman  ( as john rooney )  hiring independent hit-man jude law  ( as harlen maguire )  to track down hoechlin and hanks ,  who are off to cool their heels in chicago .  hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative ,  which is puzzling when you consider the characters' line of work .   looking uncannily like paul peterson  (  " the donna reed show "  )  ,  hoechlin does a terrific job for director sam mendes ;  and ,  getting to work with this cast makes him the luckiest young actor of 2002 .  but ,  the most striking thing about  " road to perdition "  is the stunning cinematography of conrad l .  hall ,  which deservedly won a career capping  " academy award "  for the late photographer .  mr .  hall's work is truly superlative .  this helps make up for the overall impression of a measured ,  contrived staginess to both the narrative and visuals .  the deviating end is abruptly uplifting  ( the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned staginess )  .   ******** road to perdition  ( 7/12/02 )  sam mendes ~ tom hanks ,  tyler hoechlin ,  paul newman ,  jude law
yes i have a copy of it on vhs uncut in great condition that i transfered to dvd and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a christmas classic please emil me at dmd2222@verizon . net . i searched everywhere and i found nothing on this and i thought that i cant be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape there has to be other people and if they do i fit in with them being that very very few that has this classic so i consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppets christmas except one that john denver did with the muppets again i thinks its called a smokey mountain holiday im not to sure but its close . 
i know many people have a special fondness for the alistair sim version of dickens' story ,  but for me ,  this 1984 version is the one to beat .  my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs ,  and we watch it together every christmas eve .  i often remark that we could watch it on halloween too ,  because it's a very creepy ghost story .   scott--typecast as scrooge--is shudderingly mean and nasty ,  making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving .  i think it's up there with his performance in patton .  the spirits are all effective ,  each one creepier than the last .  watching the dark ,  floating ,  skeletal form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends shivers down my spine every year .  and what a supporting cast !  david warner ,  in particular ,  is in top form as bob cratchit ,  as is susannah york as his wife .    i seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others--but i may be mistaken ,  as it's been several years since i read it .  regardless ,  this is a terrific christmas classic . 
a bloody gangster story which takes place in the years of great depression .  it tells us about another notorious hit-man ,  michael  ( mike )  salliwan .  somehow ,  this time the story turns the other way round :  mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son ,  because the rest of his family was killed due to dirty game of his own boss .  he succeeds in his revenge and secures honorable future to his son ,  but gets killed in the end .  such stories never have happy end after all .   the role of mike salliwan senior was wonderfully played by tom hanks ,  and the part of mr .  rooney  ( the mafia boss )  was performed by paul newman .  the film makes a great impression ,  and we hear the well-known phrase  " we rob banks "  .  this film is still worth watching although you could have expected something bigger from sam mendes after his american beauty . 
this is a film that can make you want to see it again .  i especially ,  liked the way it ended .  i did not see the end coming ,  but when laws was not blown away the first time ,  one suspects he will be back again .   the story is gripping and could have been more psychological ,  but i understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for that .   hard to believe michael jr .  could be so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away .  but ,  i can appreciate the scene play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell .   some have complained about hanks as a gangster .  i believe that isn't justified .  if his character had been any harder ,  he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not .   eight stars for this one .  although it was released in 2002 ,  i just saw it for the first time yesterday on dvd . 
a great gangster film . sam mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father-son camaraderie . brilliant star-cast leading with tom hanks ( michael sullivan )  has done a terrific job . great acting by him again . he is an acting legend . great acting too from paul newman , jude law and daniel craig . casting is just too good . the plot is quite good . you will enjoy the movie . a great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's . set in the 1930's , this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era . soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie . a great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son . way underrated for my liking . deserved a fully deserved 10 . 
this is one of the best movies i've ever seen .  it has very good acting by hanks ,  newman ,  and everyone else .  definitely jude law's best performance .  the cinematography is excellent ,  the editing is about as good ,  and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie .  the production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special .  to me ,  it takes a lot to beat godfather ,  but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest .  definitely a best picture nominee in my book . 
one of my favorite movies ,  with a very nostalgic ending .  the movie is about the sullivan family ,  obviously michael sullivan  ( the father )  is one of the main members of the mafia ,  the killer to say it this way ,  and an expert one .  one of the kids wants to know the work of his father  ( a terrible mistake )  ,  so he hides on his father's car and well ,  he sees tom hanks in action to say it this way .   mafia doesn't rules ,  in mafia nobody wins ,  when they want you out ,  they take you out .  of course you can see anyone who works at the mafia with a giant house ,  the best car in the world ,  whatever you like ,  but make a wrong work ,  or make something your  " boss "  doesn't want ,  and you're fired ,  and killed .   you can see what i mean in the movie ,  sullivan jr .  sees something he didn't had to see ,  and well ,  almost all his family gets killed for that  " wrong thing "  his son did .  the movie is really entertaining ,  you see how the sullivan's live after being chased by the mafia ,  or kinda of that .   this movie is kinda of sad ,  shows us about revenge ,  those dirty works people do ,  almost everything you like .  hopefully the guy is reading this comment doesn't works for the mafia ,  and if you work at the mafia make yourself a favor and get the hell out of the country before you get killed by your boss and their workers .   this movie receives :  10/10
tom hanks like you've never seen him before .  hanks plays michael sullivan ,   " the angel of death "  .  he is a hitman for his surrogate father john rooney ( paul newman ) an elderly irish mob boss .  sullivan's young son ( tyler hoechlin ) witnesses what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of sullivan's wife and other son .  enter jude law as a reporter/photographer willing to kill sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mobsters .  filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 30's .  sometimes the pace bogs down ,  but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story .  director sam mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty ,  responsibility ,  betrayal and the bonding of a secretive man and his young son .  other notable cast members are :  dylan baker ,  stanley tucci ,  daniel craig and jennifer jason leigh .  hanks again proves to be excellent in a very memorable movie .  make room for some oscars ! 
this is an excellent film ! tom hanks and paul newman performed great ! i was really surprised when newman was beating on his son ! that was a great scene and the shooting scenes were staged good . i was very surprised about the end . rent this film today as it is one of tom hanks' best ! 
an excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era .  i loved the visuals--very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel .   i thought tom hanks was really great in this ,  he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work  ( which he didn't fully choose for himself )  but still wants to have a normal life for his family .  he does the best he can to see that happen .  don't want to spoil the plot--but you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot 'em up action/gangster format .   ( it is violent though .  ) 
tom hanks has been in such hit movies as forrest gump ,  saving private ryan ,  and the green mile .  for the most part ,  his roles have been good guys that we cheer for .  in road to perdition ,  his character michael sullivanis a little bit different .   in sam mendes' film road to perdition based on the graphic novel by max allan collins ,  he shows the story of a man and his son on the road during the great depression in chicago .  what is different about this little road trip is that sullivan is a hit-man who is now being hunted by his former partner .  his boss or ex-boss john rooney  ( paul newman )  loves him almost more than his own son ,  sullivan's partner connor  ( daniel craig )  .   after a job done the wrong way because of connor ,  the only witness to his mistake are sullivan and his son who wasn't supposed to be there .  so connor tries to take out sullivan and his family ,  but only gets the wife and other son peter .  sullivan outsmarts the hit and rushes home to find michael jr .  sitting at the table .  .  . just sitting .  with his wife and child dead ,  sullivan takes to the road to find answers .   the story follows the two as sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and kid ,  and for michael who feels like he is to blame for all this .  he feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother .  tyler hoechlin does a terrific job as michael jr .  he brings maturity and also a sense of still being juvenile .  his loss of innocence is well acted out as he travels from town to town ,  leaving nothing behind him .   mendes' previous hit film was american beauty which received five oscars including best picture and best director .  this film didn't do nearly as well at the oscars only winning one award for best cinematography but receiving five other nominations for music ,  sound ,  and a best actor in a supporting role for paul newman .  this picture is a great story that takes you on a ride through the midwest and into the legend of mike sullivan :  husband ,  hit-man ,  and devoted father .  this movie is a sleeper film that should be watched for years to come . 
this is a beautiful film .  the true tale of bond between father and son .  this is by far ,  tom hanks at his finest .  tom hanks is really out of the box in this movie .  he usually has the nice guy roles .  yet in this film , he comes off in this film as a bit gritty ,  but still emerges smelling like a rose ,  even until the very last scene ,  the assassination of his character .  the cast of this movie was well put together .  i also love the part when there is total silence when tom hanks' character shoots and kills all of the men in mr .  rooney's group .  there is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene ,  just simply emotion .  i love the look on john rooney ,  paul newman's character's face when he realizes even before seeing him ,  that it is tom hanks's character getting revenge ,  and he knows his fate has come .  the first time i saw this movie i was blown away and knew i had to go out and get the video and i since have ,  adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies .   tom hanks is my favorite actor ,  so this film has a special place in me . 
so this made for tv film scores only a 7 . 6 on this site ?  bah !  humbug !  without question this 1984 version of dickens' classic tale is the best ever made .  and yes ,  the hound has seen the 1951 version which was also good ,  but not good enough .  the lack of color is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of that version ,  although the acting was wonderful .   george c .  scott is simply incredible as ebenezer scrooge .  we all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner ,  then by three other spirits later on that evening .  scott is properly gruff as scrooge .  too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the new-found glee that he awakens to on christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson .  but hey ,  this is george c .  scott .  he's never going to go dancing down the street in a fit of joy .  he has too much dignity ,  and his scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic manner .   the supporting performances are uniformly excellent ,  as are the costumes ,  music ,  and scenery .  19th century london comes to life in clive donner's visionary style .  the film even borders on frightening in several scenes involving the spirits .  the important tale of morality shines through in every frame ,  though .   you won't often find this version aired on television anymore ,  and that is a disappointment .  the 1984 version of a christmas carol should be a required part of every household's celebration of the holiday .  when the decorations come out of the basement ,  this film should find its way into the dvd player at least once during the season .   10 of 10 stars .   the hound . 
i think that this film is brilliant . there are many reasons why but these are some of them 1 ) the good acting by tom and tyler 2 )  brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of brilliance 3 )  i thought that the ending was a good twist because i never expected that at the end all credit to sam mendes . as well as a these 3 points the film form of the film is good as well .  i am a film student at college and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films i have seen in many years .  i'd just like to say a big thank you to all of the people involved in making this film .  lastly i would like to say the best scene in the film is the machine gun scene where john rooney gets kill it is just pure brilliance in shooting the scene in silence until john rooney says  "  i'm glad it's you "  it is a lot better like that i think because the viewer creates there own sound and that sound is totally different for every viewer just brilliant .   thank you for reading this comment written by ross kirk aged 16
this is the first tom hanks movie i have gotten the privilege of seeing in the theater ,  although he is my favorite .  when i heard he was going to play a hit-man ,  i was a little stunned thinking  " can mr .  hanks pull this one off "  ?  and he did in high fashion .  this 1930's depression era film is a about loyalty ,  redemption ,  and one path that you don't want your children stumbling down .  tom hanks leads a stellar cast as michael sullivan .  being the family man ,  and the secret life of the contract killer for the oscar nominated paul newman .  this movie tom hanks relies more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue ,  which he delivers a knockout performance .   on one night of one of his jobs ,  michael's son michael jr .  ,  played by newcomer tyler hoechlin ,  witnesses the hit .  and michael sr . 's partner in crime ,  fellow stage actor daniel craig can't have that information out .  so he wacks out the son and wife of michael sr .  ,  except michael jr .  so the two head for chicago to get conner rooney ( son of paul newman's mr .  rooney )  .   the drama and intense plot really thickens from their as father trys to set things right ,  even though son is along for the ride .  while on this deadly journey ,  someone has hired a hit for michael sr .  the assassin would be the photographer of the deceased harlen maguire ,  played by a stain-teethed jude law .   the movie will have you feeling the old days .  and with thomas newman's beautiful and haunting oscar nominated score to go along with it ,  you can't help but appreciate this film from oscar winning director sam mendes .  so sit back ,  and enjoy the wild ride . 
i loved this film !  i'm a true tom hanks fan ,  and i have always been impressed with all of his work .  from his most dramatic roles like cast away ,  the green mile ,  saving private ryan ,  forrest gump ,  apollo 13 & philadelphia .  to his hilarious roles like a league of their own ,  turner and hooch ,  catch me if you can ,  the lady killers ,  big & of course toy story .  but in this film hanks isn't the only great actor who lights up the screen .  tyler hoechlin ,  an up and coming star who shows great promise in hollywood co stars as hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance .  he is certainly someone to watch out for over his career ,  i believe he will do great things .  paul newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen .  he is truly a legend .  we can't forget the people who didn't have such big roles in the film ,  but still helped make it great .  the beautiful & very talented jennifer jason leigh ,  who's performance in bastard out of carolina & single white female i will never forget ,  brings her grace to the screen as hank's wife in the film and does a superb job .  liam aiken is another found treasure in film .  he does such a great job with such a small role ,  and like his roles in lemony snickets ,  and sweet november ,  and i dreamed of africa he gives a great performance . 
after gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex-rental dvds ,  i figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than sam mendes ?  for a number of reasons ,   " american beauty "  doesn't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that tom hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade .  for this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins ,  and is simply wonderful to watch because of it .  and despite my usual allergy to any film with tom hanks' name on it  ( still can't watch  " big "  without wanting a cat to kick )  ,  i'm glad i gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you'll kick yourself for if you miss it .   normally squeaky-clean hanks plays michael sullivan ,  a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during prohibition in the early 1930's .  he is also a professional hit-man to mob boss john rooney  ( paul newman )  but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons .  but after his eldest  ( tyler hoechlin )  witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing ,  the pair are forced to go on the run as john seeks to tidy the matter up .  soon ,  father and son are pursued to chicago where a fellow hit-man  ( a menacing jude law )  is waiting for them .   on the face of it ,  it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as i've said ,  this isn't really about gangsters at all .  it's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances .  hanks is  ( *grits teeth* )  superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little hoechlin is also good as sullivan's son .  in all honesty ,  there is not a single performance that i could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless .  as is the cinematography and costumes  ( and it's not often i praise costumes !  )  which recreates the 30's with stunning effect .  there has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades .  this could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30's look was difficult to put down - but it doesn't and that deserves every bit of credit .  chicago especially looks fantastic ,  lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats .  true time-travel ,  even if a little cgi is needed .   the story is also a winner ,  offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain .  law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer maguire and proves that you don't have to be cagney or de niro or brando to play a gangster .  the film is decidedly noir-ish ,  driving rain and ill-lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are  ( finally )  seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts .  the whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the tommy-gun shootouts and extortion rackets .  it can feel a little slow in places ,  especially if you're used to masses of gun-play in movies like most modern audiences  ( like yours truly )  but sometimes ,  words can speak louder than actions .  mendes has delivered a fine follow-up to his oscar-winning debut ,  a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch .   " road to perdition "  may not be to everyone's tastes but this is one dvd i shall not be exchanging anytime soon . 
road to perdition can be summed up by thomas newman's score  .  it's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of scent of a woman  ,  meeting joe black and the shawshank redemption you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen  .  as the sullivans drive round america trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of the getaway  ,  irish gangsters is miller's crossing whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by coppola and leone's gangster epics .  despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of sam mendes film which i repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and i was slightly confused as the events that caused michael sullivan to be betrayed  .  but if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director mendes is   road to perdition is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances  .  i've never been all that keen on tom hanks but he's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role  ,  probably better  .  paul newman plays a character with an irish accent but at no point did i believe i was watching an american screen legend putting on a false accent - newman's performance works due to the subtle body language  ,  his character is torn up by guilt but newman never milks it or goes over the top  .  while never upstaging newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two brit supporting actors craig and law are also very memorable as american gangsters and while law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how daniel craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become james bond  ,  a role which heralds the end of an actors career
having been driven out of the house and into the theater by the sweltering heat ,  i could not have been more pleased .  the road to perdition ,  directed by sam mendes  ( american beauty )  ,  is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time .  perhaps i'm just getting old ;  perhaps i've just seen the same themes recycled time and again .  but this movie is indeed different .   the story opens with young michael sullivan jr .  facing out to the sea ,  contemplating the duality of his father's legacy -- one of the best men to ever live ,  one of the most evil .  this duality snakes its way throughout the movie .  the story revolves around crime boss john rooney  ( paul newman )  and michael sullivan  ( tom hanks )  ,  the young man rooney once took in and who now serves as his personal  " angel of death .  "  rooney is tied by blood to his own son ,  but tied by love and loyalty to michael .  young michael jr .  ,  intrigued by the stories he reads ,  steals away in his father's car one night while dad goes off to  " work "  with connor rooney ,  heir to the family  " business .  "  connor lets the situation get out of hand ,  and what was meant only to be a warning turns into murder -- witnessed by michael jr .  upon the discovery that young michael has seen what he should not have seen ,  the plot is set in motion as conflicting loyalties collide .  soon ,  michael sr .  is on the run with his young son ,  pursued by contract killer harlen  " the reporter "  maguire  ( jude law )  .   i will disclose no further details in order to avoid any potential spoilers .  however ,  i strongly encourage viewers to examine the many dualities that present themselves in the movie :  problems between sons and fathers  ( michael sr & jr .  ,  john rooney & son connor )  ,  between the world at home and the world at  " work "  ,  between good and evil ,  between those who pretend to be men of god and those who really are ,  between  " clean "  money and  " dirty "  ,  between the town of perdition and perdition as hell .  and along the way ,  savor the visual brilliance of cinematographer conrad l .  hall  ( 9 nominations ,  2 oscars for best cinematography )  :  rain pouring off fedoras ,  shots through mirrors  ( especially on swinging doors )  ,  tommy-gun flashes from out of the shadows ,  absent any sound .  not only has 75-year-old hall given us perhaps the best cinematic product of his career ,  but 77-year-old paul newman offers one of his best performances ever .   yes  .  .  .  i may be getting old .  but i've seen a lot  .  .  .  and this is fresh and invigorating .  the road to perdition presents a lasting and loving tribute to the gangster genre ,  to films of the 40s ,  to dark comic-book figures lurking in the darkness ,  to villains and heroes ,  to american film in general .  go see it ! 
this is the best mob film ever made .  it deserved more then what it got at the oscars .  nominated for things like its score ,  art direction ,  supporting role  ( newman )  ,  this film could have easily been nominated for best picture ,  director  ( mendes )  ,  actor  ( hanks )  ,  supporting actor  ( newman and law )  and won !  !  hanks gives one of his best performances ,  and the kid who played michel jr .  was so good that i'm surprised i don't see him in more movies today .  critics themselves didn't give this film enough credit .  but besides the incredible performances ,  another real star of this film is the incredible music .  this was by far the best score of the year .  it was nominated but didn't win .  this is a great film that should be seen by everyone .  my grade-a+
frankly ,  this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors .   the opposite of perdition  ( being lost )  is salvation  ( being saved )  and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts .  the movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father-son relationship .  it should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes .   the premise is that the fathers in the move ,  hit-man michael sullivan  ( tom hanks )  and his crime boss john rooney  ( paul newman )  ,  love their sons and will do anything to protect them .  but rooney's son connor is even more evil than the rest .  he kills one of rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father .  when connor learns that sullivan's son michael witnessed it ,  he mistakenly kills sullivan's other son  ( and sullivan's wife )  in an attempt to silence witnesses .   sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price ,  even at the terribly high price of perdition .  rooney ,  who in one scene curses the day connor was born ,  refuses to give up his son connor to sullivan ,  and hires a contract killer named maguire  ( jude law )  to kill sullivan and his son .  so rooney joins his son connor on the road to perdition .   for the rest of the movie ,  accompanied by his surviving son young michael ,  sullivan pursues connor rooney down the road to perdition ,  and maguire pursues sullivan .  when sullivan confronts rooney in a church basement ,  and demands that he give up connor because connor murdered his family ,  rooney says -  " michael ,  there are only murderers in this room ,  .  .  ,  and there's only one guarantee ,  none of us will see heaven .  "  as the movie ends ,  somewhat predictably ,  one character is saved and one character repents .   i'm not a big tom hanks fan ,  but he does step out of character to play hit-man sullivan convincingly ,  giving a subtle and laconic performance .  newman does well as the old irish gangster rooney ,  showing a hard edge in his face and manner ,  his eyes haunted by connor's misdeeds .  jude law plays maguire in a suitably creepy way .  tyler hoechlin plays young michael naturally and without affectation .   the cinematography constantly played light off from darkness ,  echoing the themes of salvation and perdition .  the camera drew from a palette of greens and greys .  the greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of depression era illinois .  the greens belonged to the younger sons and that state's rural flatlands .  thomas newman's lush ,  sonorous and haunting music had faint irish overtones and was played out in copland-like arrangements .  the sets were authentic mid-western urban - factories ,  churches .  the homes shone with gleaming woodwork .   the excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes ,  distinctive acting ,  and enveloping music and cinematography .  the only negative was a slight anti-gun message slipped into the screenplay y ,  the movie's only nod to political correctness .   i give this movie a10 out of 10 ;  in time it will be acknowledged as a great film . 
this is one of the best made movies from 2002 .  maybe it is not the best movie ,  but it looks the best ,  has great acting and is directed perfectly by sam mendes ,  who debuted with 'american beauty' .   it tells the story of a gangster named michael sullivan  ( tom hanks )  who is seen by his son  ( tyler hoechlin )  on one of his jobs .  michael's boss ,  john rooney  ( paul newman )  ,  thinks things will be okay but his jealous son connor rooney  ( daniel craig )  sets both his father and michael up ,  leading to the death of michael's wife  ( jennifer jason leigh )  and second son .  michael thinks rooney is responsible and rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man harlen maguire  ( jude law )  to finish the job .  since michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss frank nitti  ( stanley tucci )  .   in a way 'road to perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that .  this movie is good in its production design ,  art direction ,  sound ,  music and most of all in its cinematography .  all these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain .  that hoechlin is not a annoying kid and hanks ,  law and newman know how to act helps ,  of course .   based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre .  sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before ,  but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time .  the scenes between the adult hanks and the child hoechlin help in that area .  see this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas . 
conrad hall went out with a bang .  the great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on .  he did himself proud as this is one of the best-looking crime films you'll ever see .   of course ,  the acting ain't bad when you have tom hanks and paul newman playing the leads !  the amount of action in here is just right ,  too :  not too much ;  not too little .   none of the characters in here ,  frankly ,  are  " good guys "  as hanks is a professional hit-man for town boss newman .  hanks' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him ,  although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies !  huh ?   as good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is ,  the real star of this film is cinematographer hall ,  who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens .  his work is just awesome . 
far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30's and 50's .  george c .  scott was born to be scrooge ,  just as he was born to be patton .  mr .  scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century .  the character of scrooge as played by mr .  scott seemed to jump off the screen .  scott as scrooge brought an richer ,  more robust ,  yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century london .  mr .  scott seemed to bring scrooge to a more personal ,  understandable yet highly conflicted level ;  his role was acted with the great authority scott always bring to the screen :  yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper ,  almost as a soliloquy ,  as he would berate the christmas holiday in one breath ,  yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line .  he could portray the sour and crusty scrooge ,  and a misunderstood ,  sympathetic scrooge all in the same scene .   truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation . 
i f you thought sam mendes' first film ,  the much heralded american beauty was a movie with style to spare ,  wait until you see his highly anticipated second effort ,  the unrelentingly grim 30's gangster melodrama road to perdition .  some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to the godfather ,  a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with mr .  mendes' extraordinary technical prowess .  if the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great ,  then yes ,  road to perdition is a distant cousin to the godfather in terms of what it achieves in cinematography ,  editing ,  music scoring and sound .  what it doesn't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over .  as with american beauty ,  there is a cold ,  distancing feel to this movie ,  despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love ,  loyalty and betrayal .   this story of a hit man  ( tom hanks )  and his relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also his boss ,  an elderly irish mob leader  ( paul newman )   ,  seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past .  the father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity  ;  the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought  ,  and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent  :  this is obviously a gangster film  ,  hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed  ,  but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of  ;  only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom .   that being said  ,  i have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film  ;  indeed  ,  it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies i have ever seen .  veteran cameraman conrad hall will very likely win another oscar for his work here  .  the production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary  ;  in fact  ,  the entire film is a technical marvel .  mr .  mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color ,  and he and mr .  hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls  ,  all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks ,  blues and grays that dominate the movie's color scheme .   if i have failed to duly note the acting  ,  it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably  ;  everyone in the film is top notch ,  with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys  :  daniel craig is the classic  " man you love to hate "  ,  the spoiled ,  impulsive son of newman's gangster father  ;  and an almost unrecognizable jude law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half .  but acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here .  if a rolls-royce was a movie  ,  i've no doubt it would look like road to perdition . 
i loved so much about this movie .  .  . the time taken to develop the characters ,  the attention to detail ,  the superb performances ,  the stunning lighting and cinematography ,  the wonderful soundtrack .  .  .   it has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick .  if we lived in elizabethan days ,  i'd say this movie's a bit like a shakespearean tragedy .  but since we don't ,  let's say it's more like a drama-suspense movie .   the plot is simple ,  but the story is complex .  the movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored .  much of the story is shown rather than told ,  which i find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book  ( or graphic novel )  .  at times i felt i was actually there in the 1930s ,  part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling .   i don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon ,  but in this case i do .   ( though i did enjoy the book too .  )  i've bought the dvd ,  which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary .    ( i also took my little cousin ,  who's a little younger than the boy in the movie ,  to see it after i saw it for the first time ,  because he has issues at home and i wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him .  he loved it - and the discussion .  ) 
this couldn't have been better .  the strong restraints on mike sullivan's expressions couldn't have been portrayed in any other way .  tom hanks delivers the best performance of his career .  young tyler hoechlin drives an emotional wheel ;  playing the basis character for the story .  and veteran paul newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time .   this film is based on a bold graphic novel by max allan collins and richard piers rayner .  this is a father/son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles .  mike sullivan had no father as a child ,  so john rooney took him in .  although a generous man ,  mr .  rooney involved himself in organized crime .  therefore ,  the debt of sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business .  now ,  sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe ,  but at the same time pay back his boss .  the events to follow ,  will test sullivan's loyalty and embrace his family's fate .   with a great adaptation by david self ,  the dialogue comes out seldomly ,  but yet very virtuous .  the story unfolds in a beautiful 1930's setting  ( brilliant art direction by richard l .  johnson & nancy haigh )  covered with a dark rainy  ( snow on the ground )  exterior .  driving the story ,  is thomas newman's wonderful irish score ,  settling in only when necessary .   but the most important technical element in the film is conrad l .  hall's beautiful photography .  this is some of the best cinematography i've seen ;  and i watch a lot of films .  the scene when mike and michael are in the car ,  entering chicago is quite impressive .  the shot starts at the front of the car ,  revealing mike ( hanks )  through the windshield .  it subsequently dollys around to the side of the car ,  to see michael ( hoechlin )  awakening and peering out his side window .  as it continues ,  it trucks sideways and dollys back ,  completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930's chicago .   with a great cast and crew ,  the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film .  i'm talking about sam mendes ,  who made his feature film debut in 1999 with american beauty .   ( won him various awards )  before american beauty ,  mendes worked as a play director for the british theater ,  but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater .  with only two films ,  sam mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors  ( in a list of about twenty-five )  .   the film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly .  the photography ,  acting and story is phenominal .  i'm still waiting for scorcesee's gangs of new york ,  but for now ,  i'm fully confident in saying that this is the  " best film of the year "  .  considering it's competition  ( signs ,  insomnia ,  minority report )  thats a strong statement . 
acting this film is a very well acted film .  i will say that the performances are slightly weak at times ;  but for the most part ,  the acting is very good .  the only actor that blew me away with his performance was jude law as harlen maguire .  he was incredible !  tom hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible .  paul newman ,  good as always .  cinematography this is what made the movie a masterpiece  ( and i rarely use that word )  .  conrad hall is a true genius .  if at any point in the movie you were to pause it ,  you will see the delicately crafted work of this man .  he sets up every shot so that nothing is left out .  when the camera is still ,  there is a postcard like quality to the screen .  when the camera is moving ,  every shot is planned to understated perfection .  but it doesn't stop there .  conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art .  the way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work i've seen .  his work on this movie made it what it is .  this movie is at the top of the list for best cinematography with lotr ,  black hawk down ,  hero ,  cthd ,  moulin rouge ,  and vertigo .  story people will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but ,  i believe they missed the point of the movie .  it is a love story about a hit-man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose .  it is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other .  the screen writing is worthy of an oscar .  music thomas newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story .  the music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores i've herd .  direction sam mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director .  the symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film-making world .  i will be on the lookout for the next sam mendes film .  10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies i've ever seen . 
road to perdition ,  a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year oscars is the second work of sam mendes  ( and in my opinion his best work )  ,  a director who three years before won oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial american beauty .  this is a terrific movie ,  and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad .   it's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of depression when the ,  michael sullivan ,  a father of two children ,  played by great tom hanks  ( i'm not his admirer but ought to say that )  is a hit-man for local mafia boss ,  played by paul newman .  his eldest son ,  a thirteen years boy michael sullivan jr .  ,  perfectly played by young tyler hoechlin ,  after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live .  prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder ,  committed by john rooney ,  son of his father boss .  such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever .  the atmosphere of the period ,  all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created ,  editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written .  but the main line of the movie ,  the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times .  they are shown so deeply ,  strong and believable .  tom hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb .  finally worth to mention a very nice score by paul newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful  ( but one more time sad )  masterpiece .  i believe road to perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film-making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year .   my grade 10 out of 10
deranged and graphically gory japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg-zombie like machines- which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser .  in the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected .   technically superb horror comedy (  ?  )  is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying .  good taste prevents me from describing what happens here ,  but lets just say its pretty gruesome .  if you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film .  personally i'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level .  here i was intrigued enough that i can suggest it to people i know who like really gory movies .  .  its also a film with enough going on in the details that i want to see it again since now that i know what was going on-as revealed in the end-i want to go back and see what it was i didn't catch on to .  there is an internal logic rare in these films .   7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs ,  its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else . 
some may feel that the rating i have just given is a bit generous ,  but for what this film is i think the directors have done a good job with that they had available to them ,  this is also a film a film of an acquired taste !    my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film 'the thing' i . e the parasitical aliens from outta space ,  infesting human host to then reek havoc wherever possible !   you can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror/gore genre ,  however cleverly maintains its own originality ,  well these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat then fallen rival !  only killing and picking a human when it needs a new host !  to then pick another fight with another infected host !  and this film even throws in a love story but i wont say no more otherwise it gives too much away .   great !  but like i said of an acquired taste ,  so don't be surprised if you don't like the film .  it is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty ,  with the creatures/aliens/things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons ,  i . e saws ,  drills ,  blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent .  i found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next !   so if you like gore ,  you like aliens ,  you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere ,  then i must recommend this film as a must see .  i just wish i came across this earlier then i did ! 
why aren't more films  ( especially american )  more like meatball machine ?    this is my first official on-line review and i am charged with  " electrical ecstasy "  after having chosen  " meatball machine "  as my first endeavor .  this is a review ,  so i'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion .   i mean ,  this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic tetsuo !  so what if it's not all original ?  i own both of these films and though tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch ,  meatball machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance .  meatball machine is as elaborate in it's story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore .  thank you jesus for japanese cinema !   simply put ,  the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching nightmare on elm street when i was 7 or so .  i could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end .  this time  ( at 31 )  my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring .   in this film human bodies are host to aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood .  humans become flesh eating cyborgs !  !  !  there's more !  !  !  fight scenes !  !  great music !  !  great point-of-view shots !  decent acting by the woman cyborg  ( at least better than her male counterpart )  .  the fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times .   oh ,  and did i forget to mention it's a love story !  wow ,  i hate love stories but this takes the cake !   i can't wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces .  sadly ,  i took time to write this review because i'm afraid most friends and family wont understand meatball machine .  the truth is america as a whole is not prepared for meatball machine .   lastly ,  my wife walked in while i was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless .  normally she says something like  " why are you watching that junk ?  "  this time she had nothing to say .  i was glad !    this is not junk .  this isn't just splatter  ( splatter for the sake of splatter is also great )  .  this is art my friends .  art .   chacho
for fans of troma or the cyberpunk genre mixed with a little blood shed then this film for you !  there is a good amount of blood shed within the confines of this film ,  also the effects can be impressionable and awesome .  the plot is ridiculous and refreshing ,  not being chained down to what we as audiences are expectant of from films these days .   also notable are the little aliens ,  who i found cute .  all in all ,  it's a good film for fans of the genre .  also recommended are films such as tetsuo : the iron man and versus for that weird japanese film approach ,  filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed .  of course ,  seeing this film you should already have knowledge of the two . 
most of the feedback i've heard concerning meatball machine has been pretty mixed .  a couple even saying that they think  " it sucked "  .  well ,  to those people i say ,  get some f@ckin imagination and go f@ck yourself .  this was a very entertaining flick .   the story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these gwar-costume looking ,  deathbots called necroborgs .  eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a little parasite onto you ,  which then is able to control your actions due to hot-wiring your nervous system .  unfortunately for two love-seeking lonely young adults ,  they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug ,  and before you know it transformations are taking place and blood is being splattered .  is there a way to stop the transformation ?  maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat ?  why do the necroborgs fight one another ?  do the two desperate singles get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty ?  only one way to find out .   going into meatball machine i was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions ,  but it turned out being a great surprise .  a few unanswered questions ,  some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points i can think of .  from the anime feel to it ,  to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel ,  this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses .  with a ever-developing story that's interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make-up effects and blood splatter ,  this is one flick fans of bizarro/horror/tetsuo/splatter fans should check out .  8 outta 10
this 1984 version of the dickens' classic `a christmas carol , ' directed by clive donner ,  stars george c .  scott as ebenezer scrooge .  by this time around ,  the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again ;  and ,  happily to say ,  with this film donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it .  he tells the story with precision and an eye to detail ,  and extracts performances from his actors that are nothing less than superlative ,  especially scott .  one could argue that the definitive portrayal of scrooge-- one of the best known characters in literary fiction ,  ever-- was created by alastair sim in the 1951 film ;  but i think with his performance here ,  scott has now achieved that distinction .  there is such a purity and honesty in his scrooge that it becomes difficult to even consider anyone else in the role once you've seen scott do it ;  simply put ,  he is scrooge .  and what a tribute it is to such a gifted actor ;  to be able to take such a well known figure and make it so uniquely his own is quite miraculous .  it is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well ,  to be able to make a character so real ,  from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face ,  and to make it all ring so true .  it's a study in perfection .   the other members of the cast are splendid as well ,  but then again they have to be in order to maintain the integrity of scott's performance ;  and they do .  frank finlay is the ghost of jacob marley ;  a notable turn ,  though not as memorable ,  perhaps ,  as the one by alec guinness  ( as marley )  in the film ,  `scrooge . ' angela pleasence is a welcome visage as the spirit of christmas past ;  edward woodward ,  grand and boisterous ,  and altogether convincing as the spirit of christmas present ;  and michael carter ,  grim and menacing as the spirit of christmas yet to come .   david warner hits just the right mark with his bob cratchit ,  bringing a sincerity to the role that measures up well to the standard of quality set by scott's scrooge ,  and susannah york fares just as well as mrs .  cratchit .  the real gem to be found here ,  though ,  is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim ;  it's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin ,  and simply one of the best interpretations-- and the most real-- ever presented on film .   the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees  ( fred holywell ,  and also the narrator of the film )  ,  caroline langrishe  ( janet holywell )  ,  lucy gutteridge  ( belle )  ,  michael gough  ( mr .  poole )  and joanne whalley  ( fan )  .  a flawless presentation ,  this version of `a christmas carol' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged ;  no matter how many versions you may have seen ,  watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever .  and forever after ,  whenever you think of scrooge ,  the image your mind will conjure up will be that of george c .  scott .  a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying experience ,  this film demands a place in the annual schedule of the holiday festivities of every home .  i rate this one 10/10 . 
wow baby ,  this is indeed some fine asian horror/gore ,  and a crazy outlandish movie .  this is a japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of tetsuo ,  except in this case with all the blood and guts ,  there is a bizarre love story .  it's hard to imagine how they even dreamed up this visually stunning movie ,  with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites ,  turning them into part machine or i guess cyborgs .  the only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human ,  is they need to kill each other and eat the other .  hmmm ,  yum yum .  this would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that ,  with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun .  the movie also borrows a little from carpenter's  " the thing "  in creature design and effects .  i would put this in the must-have category for gorehounds ,  as there is non-stop carnage and some very fine gore .  and a must-have for stoners ,  because you don't even need to read the sub-titles ,  the visual images alone are enough of a mind trip .  the design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of frank henenlotter's movies ,  which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humour .   " meatball machine "  is great fun for gorehounds ,  there is no doubt about it ,  and i simply loved it . 
don't be fooled by the silly title folks ,  this is one sweet ride !  a true successor to tetsuo the iron man and ichi the killer ,  this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll .  it seems that aliens are taking over people's bodies and modifying them into war-machines ,  which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species .  the winner of the battle eats the loser alive .  that's mostly it for plot ,  but who cares when the gore is this good ?  i have no idea how many buckets of slime were used ,  but it's disgusting to behold .  there is interesting and effective use of stop-motion when the takeovers are in progress ,  and loving care is lavished on all of the creature and make-up effects .  the cgi is a bit limited ,  but that actually doesn't detract from the overall quality one bit ,  at least for me .  this was truly a fun and stomach-turning film that deserves much praise ,  and has truly earned its place in the stack of cult classics .  find it and watch ,  you won't be disappointed ! 
the japanese cyber-punk films have never really done a whole lot for me ,  but of the handful that i've seen ,  most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining .  meatball machine is no exception .   the storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts ,  takes control of their bodies ,  turns them into  " necroborgs "  ,  and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other - apparently as a  " game "  for the enjoyment of said parasites .  the film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other ,  but whose love-affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites ,  and are forced to fight each other .  it becomes a test of human-will vs .  the parasite's control over their physical bodies .  .  .   meatball machine will invariably be compared to tetsuo  ( as most cyber-punk films are )  ,  and for good reason .  there are definitely some thematic parallels ,  though the films are definitely different .  there's plenty of fun ,  splattery moments in meatball machine ,  and the creature/borg fx are definitely the high-point - a mixture of tetsuo-meets-gwar that are both elaborate and inventive .  depending on your taste for these types of films ,  meatball machine may or may not be your thing .  if you enjoy hyper-kinetic cyber-punk films with a healthy dose of splatter - this one's for you .  .  . 7/10
meatball machine is an amazing splatter film ,  it has an original plot with young love ,  buckets of blood ,  and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war machines .   now the film isn't for everyone ,  people who love splatter films or the movie tetsuo :  the iron man will applaud it .   the special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film ,  but your not exactly suppose to take the film very seriously .   yet ,  all in all it's a lot of fun ,  well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien oozing battles . 
i don't know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of  "  tetsuo  "  or not  .  why  "  tetsuo  "   ?  because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious  "  tetsuo  "  rip - off  .  the concept is similar  ,  editing is equally frantic and fast - which is good because  ,  aside from making the movie more dynamic  ,  it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors  .   there is lot more gore  ,  less eroticism and  ,  in the case of  "  meatball machine  "   ,  the transformation of human being into a creature that's partially a machine (  sounds familiar  ?   )  called  "  necroborg  "   (  very original  )  is caused by slimy little aliens  .   these slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other  .  they infest the body  ,  somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other necroborgs  .  their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another necroborg  ,  rip it out of the corpse and eat it  .   all in all  ,  the plot sounds somewhat silly and i didn't expect much  ,  but at the end i actually enjoyed this film  .   as i said before  ,  this is a low budget flick  ,  but it's still relatively decent  .  don't expect much from actors  ,  they're mostly not very good  ,  but it can be tolerated  .  i liked the atmosphere and gore  ,  certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited  .  although the story is not too original  ,  it possesses certain charm - to me at least  .   7 out of 10  . 
directed by the duo yudai yamaguchi  ( battlefield baseball )  and jun'ichi yamamoto  " meatball machine "  is apparently a remake of yamamoto's 1999 movie with the same name .  i doubt i'll ever get a chance to see the original so i'll just stick commenting on this one .  first of what is  " meatball machine "   ?  a simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore .  it's not something you'll end up writing books about but it's nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema .    " meatball machine "  follows the well known plot .  boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date .  boy finally meets girl .  girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg .  boy ,  in turn does also transform into said thing ,  and goes on a quest to save his love .  will he succeed ?  who gives a damn ,  as long as there is carnage and death i'm satisfied .   the plot is simple ,  relatively clichéd but it does it's job well enough setting the movie's course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters .  there is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives .  and yes it too luckily shows more violence .  i'm happy .  acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film .  it's not exactly painful for the ears but it's not exactly good either .   the movie's main attraction besides the violence and gore  ( like i haven't mentioned that enough already )  are the cyborg designs .  done by keita amemiya who's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video-games is well known .  the necroborgs as they are called in  " meatball machine "  look stunningly detailed .  without the usage of cgi amemiya's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal ,  painfully awesome in their appearance .  able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws ,  rocket launchers ,  blood-firing shotguns and so on and so on .  though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film ,  necroborgs are a-movie class .    " meatball machine "  is  " tetsuo the iron man "  mixed up with  " alien "  all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode .  it's an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking . 
this movie is the first time movie experience for several people in the cast .  all of them are experienced actors and have played in several tv series and plays .  sahan gokbakar is a well known comedian in turkey .  it's kind of strange to see him in a thriller ,  while he is at the peak of his comedy career in turkey .  this movie is togan gokbakar's first long shot and pretty much the first experience as a director .  but they all did a good job .  we are happy to see such enthusiastic young cast .  they seem very promising for the future of the turkish film industry .  doga rutkay being long time sweetheart of sahan gokbakar ,  is also a talented actress ,  who is known for her recent play in  " number 27 "  theatrical play and several tv series . 
it is an excellent thriller from turkey which can make sense . great job from gokbakar brothers .   first of all , i want to point on screen play . generally screen play in most films from turkey is not enough , but gen has the best shots to be said  " perfect "  . and also transition parts are really excellent .   on the other hand ,  " gen "  has a great topic that influence everyone . especially , a woman  , who wants to be a psyciatrist in a sanitarium  , has a mother that is a habitual insanity . principal causes and psychological consequences are given in gen . the only thing you have to do is to combine all the hints .   there is an impressive aggression part doga rutkay and sahan gokbakar played . this performance may be more realistic than  "  irréversible ( monica bellucci )   "  .   the last thing i want to say is  " watch this movie , you'll get confused " 
a young  (  only 21  )  director with great talent ,  a powerful scenario ,  young and ambitious cast with all theatrical background .  .  .   one of the first tries of a thriller in turkish cinema ,  which seems in the future we'll have some more based on the success .  .  .   shot on high definition video ,  the movie is perhaps effected on world thrillers ,  especially the american thrillers .  the technical and cinematographic character is quite well done ,  the scenes are all well worked on .  not too much blood but sufficient enough to make you think you're in a blood bath too .  .  .   the scenario is quite wise but with certain clues ,  a clever audience can easily predict what's going on and at the end when everything settles down you're getting somehow weird to conclude the result .   well done tiglon ,  one of the biggest dvd distributors in turkey ,  it is not easy to decide for such a movie in their first try as a production company .  .  . 
despite of the success in comedy or drama ,  the turkish directors are failure in horror-thriller .   " okul-d@bbe "  are good examples for the awful horror turkish films .   but if you watch  " gen "  you will understand that it is a strike .  the atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark .  also the special features are colorful and not cheap .  the soundtracks fit the movie ,  but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary .   as a result  " gen "  does not add any difference to horror movies ,  but it does not disappoint thriller fans .  in this respect it is a success for yesilcam and turkey .   ( 7/10 ) 
i must say ,  i was surprised with the quality of the movie .  it was far better than i expected .  scenario and acting is quite good .  the director made a good job as well .  although some scenes look a bit clumsy ,  it is a decent movie overall .  the idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end .  the mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good .  the plot was clear ,  consistent and well thought .  some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development .  moral of the story ,  it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good . 
a real classic .  a shipload of sailors trying to get to the towns daughters while their fathers go to extremes to deter the sailors attempts .  a maidens cry for aid results in the dispatch of the  " rape squad "  .  a cult film waiting to happen ! 
i agree with the other comments .  i saw this movie years ago .  christopher plummer is hilarious as a dandy .  the ribaldry is unsurpassed .  if this comes out on video ,  i will definitely buy it . 
lock up your daughters is one of the best high-spirited comedies i have ever seen .   it is misunderstood since it lacks the  " social commentary "  values that many films of the day  ( 1969 )  required to be successful .   the characters are over-the-top satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors .   christopher plummer shines especially bright as lord foppington ,  a noble with hair too big to fit in the door .   the plot involves the usual 18th century stuff ;  mistaken identities ,  thwarted romances ,  corrupt government officials ,  and jokes at every turn .   it answers the questions :  what happens when 4 rambunctious ,  eager to party sailors are on leave in a small british coastal town ?  and ,  who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out ?   despite doing poorly at the box office ,  it has great costumes ,  excellent music ( based on the mermaid theatre musical of the same name )  ,  great , lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic .   that it has never been released on either vhs or dvd is truly a shame ,  since so many bad movies are released every day . 
i saw this film 12 years ago on tnt .  it was susanah york's birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature with tom jones  ( 1963 )  .  i have not seen this film on tv since .  i took interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented jim dale ,  as lusty the sailor .  i believe that dale now does the narration of the harry potter books on casette ,  but anyway he is quite funny .  this is a fast paced comedy .  it is not on vhs or dvd .  columbia pictures should go through their film collection ,  and consider restoring and releasing this film to dvd .  christopher plummer is hilarious as lord fopington ,  ian bannen is also quite humorous as ramble the sailor .  this is a bawdy comedy ,  the kind of film one no longer sees ,  with great production values .  ***1/2 stars out of ****
when our local tv station first launched ,  it filled a lot of its schedule with old british programming .   " lock up your daughters !  "  was duly aired ,  and i -- swayed by the opening few seconds of the film -- popped in a blank tape .  best thing i ever did .   the actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to delightful life ,  complete with appropriate accents  ( christopher plummer's foppington will leave you in stitches ,  as will hoyden and her family )  .  double entendres abound ,  plot-line wheels within wheels mix and match the characters ,  hilarious sight gags lurk in every scene ,  and risqué comments are made on a regular basis .   i showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called the piece  " a lost treasure ,  "  as much for the cast as for the story .  to this day i can crack up just thinking about the dialog .  should this gem ever find its way to a dvd release ,  i'll be at the front of the line . 
i love this anime !  i was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence  ( mostly from akane ranma's reluctant but short tempered  " fiancee "  ) is so slapstick however ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amends .  .  . clumsily .  the main character ranma goes to china to train only to fall into the cursed jusenkkyo spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water .  from then on it's pure chaos one after another .  among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of kuno and kodachi ,  the sexy shampoo ,  the pervert happosai all causing trouble for our hero/heroine .  however it is ranma's selfish father genma who winds up being the culprit for the mess most of the time .  if anyone want an anime that's funny ,  this is the one .  it's cuter and better with the japanese dub . 
this movie is a very realistic view of a police squad in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman recruit .  she brings her way of dealing with the law ,  which means more than simple convictions .  the strong performance of the main character ,  supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable . 
so i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene ,  with very few shows i simply will not watch .   this show ,  however ,  i would recommend to anyone .   quite possibly the most original series to date ,  it ; s got just about everything i could ask for .  a side story ,  so to speak ,  about an unconditional love that will not be admitted to ,  a very blatant comedy ,  and a very well put together voice acting cast  ( both japanese and american translation )  .   if not for the terribly funny aspect to it ,  it would be ,  just another anime .   more or less ,  as i have noticed ,  a 'love it or hate it' ,  very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for it .   original to the core ,  with everything you could ask for in an afternoon ,  bet the house on this series .  i'm ready to assure you that you will enjoy it . 
wow .  .  .  i mean wow this has got to be one of the best story's i've ever had the chance to read/watch .  we all know this famous story .  two martial artist ,  a man and his son ,  go to train in the forbidden cursed springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each .  the dad ,  genma ,  the spring of drowned panda .  and 16 year old ranma ,  the spring of drowned girl .  now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in .  crazy enough yet ?  no ,  thats just the beginning .  as if being one of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female wasn't enough ,  ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles ,  an insane high school principle ,  opponents right and left who have a score to settle with ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for  " stealling "  their loved ones .  and speaking of loved ones ,  i've lost track of how many times a boy or a girl has fallen in love with ranma .  and not once has it been his fiancée ,  akane .  and thats just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series .   the story itself is amazing .  i have never come across something so crazy ,  so bizarre ,  so .  .  .  so .  .  .  out of this world and yet its so down to earth and believable .  .  .  i can't even describe it to its fullest .  its just a charming story thats so easy to get into .  what i like about it is the humor .  not once have i laughed out loud this much from a manga ,  and it doesn't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in simpson's or something of the sort .  i could read any part of the comic and i would be laughing from beginning to end .  another thing is the characters .  ranma ,  you would think making him too strong would be a set back but nooo .  .  .  with every little problem the story throws at him he's doing his best just to survive half the time and his personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst he can be a calculating genius .  and to think ,  of the hundreds of perverts in the show ,  ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in his town ,  more so by akane ,  the worst pervert to ever live .  his father genma ,  you would think the father character would blend in to the background right ?  correct !  but whenever he does have some spotlight .  .  .  he just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him !  you think you know the worst dad ever from an anime ?  you haven't met genma .  ryoga ,  probably one of ranma's greatest rivals and my favorite character  ( next to ranma )  .  .  .  and probably one of the only people he can actually stand .  most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults ,  one is his curse that turns him into a baby pig but his worst fault .  .  .  is his lack of sense in direction !  then we have .  .  .  you know ,  i could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters ,  the story's ,  everything positive about it but that would be just pointless .   check out the series if you haven't ,  now !  you will not regret it !  though i would advise checking the comic out first .  i like the anime ,  but i've had some trouble getting the series at a good price .  and a small nitpick ,  the humor doesn't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga .  i think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me .  but either way ,  its a win win !  10 out of 10 ! 
admittedly ,  i first picked up ranma 1/2 when i was around twelve .  i was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read .  then ,  i went to the comic/manga section and spotted this book .  at my first few reads through the chapters i didn't really know what was going on ,  but i knew that i loved it .  i even took it home for a few more reads over .  frankly ,  i wasn't getting anywhere .  and then ,  about five months  ( i'm 16 now )  ago my friend was watching some anime series and i remembered about this manga .  i couldn't remember what it was called ,  but recalled that the author was rumiko takahashi ,  creator of inu yasha .  i googled it ,  and then made a rash decision to watch all 161 episodes .  at first i was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics ,  but it didn't really matter in the end .  no anime has ever made me laugh so hard and rewind ,  watch again .  i once watched 45 consecutive episodes within a day .  i don't know how i did it .  .  .  but i couldn't stop .  eventually ,  after about two days ,  i grew obsessed .  i even dreamt--as crazy as this sounds--about watching ranma .  never have i found a series so enjoyable ,  so funny ,  and so heartwarming to watch .  to this day 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied .  of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go bonkers ,  but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading .    ranma 1/2 is about a boy named ranma saotome and his dad genma saotome .  intense martial artists .  they are so intense ,  that they went to the ancient training grounds in china and became 'cursed' .  the grounds were full of different pools of springs ,  and if you land in one ,  you take the shape of whatever drowned there when doused in cold water .  for genma ,  that was a panda ,  and for ranma that was a .  .  .  girl !  it's a very crafty fun loving story .  on top of that ,  genma promises his friend that ranma will marry one of his daughters to keep the tendo dojo alive .  'course the one he gets matched up with hates his guts and the feelings mutual .  obviously they start to like one another ,  but both way to stubborn to admit it .  but .  .  genma has a history of doing this .  he promised ranma to many girls .    trust me .  it's worth watching .  it's humorous ,  heartwarming and all around amazing . 
''ranma ½ "  is my favorite anime by rumiko takahashi .  the woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story ,  that is not only a comedy ,  but also an action anime .  the main character of the story is ranma saotome ,  a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts .  ranma is engaged to akane because of an arrangement of both fathers ,  who are great friends and trained together during many years .    akane is the younger and most violent sister of the tendo's :  kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what .   ranma and akane fight all the time , specially because both have a very bad temper ,  and when they discover that ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda , many new characters and situations starts to happen .  they also discover the reason of the transformation :  while fighting ,  ranma and his father fell in a cursed river .  but not only them had this kind of fate .  .  .   if you watched ''ranma 1/2'' and liked ,  i would recommend you ''inuyasha'' and ''maison ikkoku "  ,  two other good creations from rumiko's hands . 
first things first ,  edison chen did a fantastic ,  believable job as a cambodian hit-man ,  born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring ,  where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive ,  living on the mantra of kill or be killed .  in a role that had little dialogue ,  or at least a few lines in cambodian/thai ,  his performance is compelling ,  probably what should have been in the jet li vehicle danny the dog ,  where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting ,  and on someone else's leash .   like danny the dog ,  the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically ,  but rather designed as normal ,  brutal fisticuffs ,  where everything goes .  this probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each other's throats ,  in defending their own lives while taking it away from others .  it's a grim ,  gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively ,  and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production .   edison plays a hired gun from cambodia ,  who becomes a fugitive in hong kong ,  on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry .  leading the chase is the team led by cheung siu-fai ,  who has to contend with maverick member inspector ti  ( sam lee )  ,  who's inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father .  so begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of hong kong .   the story itself works on multiple levels ,  especially in the character studies of the hit-man ,  and the cop .  on opposite sides of the law ,  we see within each character not the black and white ,  but the shades of grey .  with the hit-man ,  we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl  ( pei pei )  ,  bringing about a sense of maturity ,  tenderness ,  and revealing a heart of gold .  the cop ,  with questionable tactics and attitudes ,  makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done .  there are many interesting moments of moral questioning ,  on how anti-hero ,  despicable strategies are adopted .  you'll ask ,  what makes a man ,  and what makes a beast ,  and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances - do we have that dark inner streak in all of us ,  transforming from man to dog ,  and dog to man ?  dog bite dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end ,  though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag ,  especially on its tender moments ,  and it suffered too from not knowing when to end .  if i should pick a favourite scene ,  then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered ,  a suspenseful edge of your seat moment .  listen out for the musical score too ,  and you're not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs .   highly recommended ,  especially if you think that you've seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre . 
first of all that i would like to say is that edison chen is extremely hot and that sam lee is looking much better than before xd !  this is probably one of the most original movies i have seen so far ;  shows a poverty lifestyle background of a cambodian .  the cambodian ( edison aka pang )  goes around killing people to survive himself ;  has done it throughout his entire life .  sam lee's ( wai )  duty is to capture the cambodian for good .  there are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it .  the movie shows the struggles between those two characters ;  they both beat each other like angry dogs .  go and watch ppl .  .  . strongly suggessted !  !  !   ( go hk films ) 
this has got to be the best movie i've ever seen .   combine breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot ,  and you have a masterpiece .   dog bite dog had me gripping the edge of my seat during some scenes ,  recoiling in horror during others ,  and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic ending .   the film left a deep impression on me .  it's shockingly violent scenes contrasted sharply with the poignant and tender 'love' scenes .  the film is undeserving of it's cat iii  ( nudity )  rating ;  there are no nude scenes whatsoever ,  and the 'love' scenes do not even involve kissing or 'making out' .   the message which this film presented to me ?  all human beings ,  no matter how violent or cruel they may seem ,  have a tender side .  edison chen does a superb job playing the part of the murderous pang .   i rate this film 10/10 .  it's a must-watch . 
dog bite dog isn't going to be for everyone ,  but i really enjoyed it .  full of slapping ,  stabbing and shooting  ( but don't worry  the lead's a terrible shot )  ,  it can best be described as a violent romp through hong kong and cambodia .  edison cheng plays pang ,  a cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister .  despite being filthy from his journey ,  he's almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant .  if this sounds wildly implausible to you ,  you should probably avoid this film .  it acted as my cue to suspend disbelief ,  and i had a lot more fun for it .   chasing pang down is wai  ( sam lee )  ,  a young ,  edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke .  wai walks a fine line that has internal affairs investigating him ,  and his father ,  a legendary good cop ,  is in a coma following a drug deal that went south  ( the implication is that wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealings )  .   there are a car crashes ,  lots of killings ,  and a strange and awkward love story on offer here ,  all played out in almost comic-book style .  i suspect the humour was deliberate  ( nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd )  ,  though the over-the-top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members .  there are at least three points where the film might have ended ,  and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing ,  or the deletion of one of the narrative threads  ( the light-hearted stuff worked well ,  so i would have left out the interactions with the three fathers )  .   i'm inclined to give it a  ( high )  pass ,  however ,  if only because of the ending  i've rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment .  this is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous
ultra-grim crime drama from pou-soi cheang ,  the director of  " home sweet home "  .  tonally ,  it reminded me of billy tang's  " run and kill "  ,  although it's not as polished as that .  nevertheless ,  it's an engaging ,  flawed bit of mayhem about a cambodian loner ,  pang  ( edison chen )  ,  who arrives in hong kong to kill a lawyer .  while fleeing the scene ,  he kills the partner of cop sam wai ,  who ,  to add insult to injury ,  is in the midst of dealing with his dying father ,  so sam begins an insane ,  obsessive manhunt for pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence .  there must be something in the air lately because i've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as i have lately .  this is grim ,  nasty stuff ,  which is why i'm so partial to it ,  and i applaud its downbeat vibe .  it's visually arresting and the sound design is very unique .  dramatically ,  everything spirals downwards until every character finds him- or herself in a world of screaming pain .  a subplot involving pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery . 
i watched the dvd of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track  ( in english )  .  it seems in cambodia  ( the subtitles in english say the character is speaking thai but the movie says cambodia ) a very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill .  he sends pang to kill some people in china and during the killings a cop's partner is killed .  the cop wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma .  wai's chief is his dad's friend and is worried about wai's erratic behavior .  he doesn't know wai was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma .  pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father won't let her leave  ( pang doesn't speak chinese and doesn't understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for cat iii )  .  wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting pang but pang is almost unstoppable .  even after pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant wai follows and joins the evil man  ( who's training the boys ) making a deal to fight and train so he can get pang .  there is a big showdown between wai and pang with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving wai dead and pang cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer .  this film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack .  there are many very brutal violent scenes .  the woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot .  knives to the neck and torso .  guns fired directly to the head .  and several very intense beatings .  it maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing . 
some comments here on imdb have likened dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the 90s ,  but although it is undoubtedly brutal ,  violent and very downbeat ,  this film from pou-soi cheang isn't really sleazy ,  lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison .  however ,  it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch ,  particularly if gritty ,  hard-edged action is your thing .   edison chen plays pang ,  a cambodian hit-man who travels to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge ;  sam lee is wai ,  the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down ,  whatever the cost .  with wai closing in on his target ,  pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeuntil he meets yue ,  a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse .   a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography ,  amazing sound design ,  a haunting score ,  and solid performances from chen and lee  ( as well as newcomer pei pei as pang's love interest )  ,  dog bite dog is one for fans of hard-hitting asian hyper-violence  ( think along the lines of chan-wook park's vengeance trilogy )  .  stabbings ,  shootings ,  merciless beatings :  all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director cheang .   of course ,  this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved ,  and sure enough ,  pretty much everyone in this film dies  ( rather nasty deaths )  .  unfortunately ,  there is a fine line between tragedy and  ( unintentional )  comedy ,  and in its final moments ,  dog bite dog crosses it :  in a laughably over-dramatic final scene ,  pang and wai are locked in battle as a pregnant yue looks on .  eventually ,  after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas ,  a wounded pang performs a diy ceasarean on  ( a now dead )  yue ,  delivering their baby moments before he himself dies .   whilst this film might not be a 'classic' slice of hong kong excess ,  with its deliriously ott action and stylish visuals ,  it's still worth seeking out . 
as i understand it ,  after the chinese took over hong kong ,  the infamous cat .  3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared .  at least until now ,  and what an amazing movie this one is .  i knew it was a rough crime drama going in ,  but being the first cat .  3 i've purchased that's been made recently ,  i wasn't sure what to expect .   a cambodian hit-man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge ,  who is also a lawyer .  turns out ,  the judge made the arrangements for the hit-man ,  because she was divorcing the judge ,  and threatening to take all his money .  this is all known within the first ten minutes ,  so nothing is being given away .  after the hit ,  the cops locate the hit-man pretty fast ,  but in trying to arrest him ,  several police officers and civilians are killed .  he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy ,  before he escapes back to cambodia .  this is a movie that never stops ,  and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath .  yes ,  it is very violent and intense ,  many cops are killed ,  as the hit-man proves very very hard to track ,  and take down when they do locate him .  along the way ,  the hit-man in trying to hide in a dump ,  finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man .  he helps her ,  and saves her from the guy ,  and she persuades the hit-man to take her along with him in his escape .  i loved this movie ,  it's like a roller-coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed ,  as one incident leads to another ,  and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit-man .  the acting is exceptionally good ,  and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking .  there's no let up in this movie ,  not even with the very very incredible ending .  the ending is pretty much unbelievable ,  and also a fitting end to all the action and violence .  yes ,  the violence is brutal at times ,  but this is a very no nonsense crime drama ,  that will knock your socks off .   " dog eat dog "  definitely needs a more widespread release ,  including an r1 release for sure .  great movie ,  highly recommended . 
the simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film ,  and also relates to the dogma films .   did you ever get bored of those hollywood-style cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of ?  fed up with the married-living-single cop ,  the divorced-but-family-man ,  the personified doughnut and the tough hunter ?  ever wondered how the real police work is like ?   well ,  for germany ,  this film shows you .  set in the north between west germany and east germany ,  former ddr ,  an laid off post office clerk starts her job ,  fresh from policeschool .  she quickly finds her way around the usual customers ,  and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman .  .  .  but this is not much fun .   other german crime films like derrick ,  der alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects .  these cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder .  good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view ,  even more if you know that part of germany a bit . 
despite being quite far removed from my expectations ,  i was thoroughly impressed by dog bite dog .  i rented it not knowing much about it ,  but i essentially expected it to be a martial arts/action film in the standard hong kong action tradition ,  of which i am a devoted fan .  i ended up getting something entirely different ,  which is not at all a bad thing .  while the film could be classified as such ,  and there is definitely some good action and hand to hand combat scenes in the film ,  it is definitely not the primary focus .  its characters are infinitely more important to the film than its fights ,  a rather uncommon thing in many hong kong action movies .   i was really quite surprised by the intricacy of the characters and character relationships in the film .  the lead character ,  played by edison chen  ( who is really very good )  ,  becomes infinitely more complex by the end of the film than i ever thought he would be after watching the first thirty minutes .  the police characters also defied my expectations thoroughly .  in fact ,  the stark and honest portrayal of the seldom seen dark side of the police force was quite possible my favorite aspect of the film .  i don't know that i would say dog bite dog entirely subverts typical notions of bad criminal ,  good cop ,  but it certainly distorts them in ways not often seen in film  ( unfortunately )  .  so many films ,  especially hong kong action films i find ,  portray police in what is frankly a very ignorantly idealized light .  this is one of my least favorite things about the genre .  i was pleasantly surprised to see that dog bite dog actually had some very unique ,  and really quite courageous ,  ideas to present about the police force .  there are negotiation scenes in this film that i have never seen the likes of before ,  and doubt i will ever see again ,  and am sure i will remember for quite a while .  also ,  the criminal characters are shown from an interesting perspective as well ,  there is some documentary footage in the film of cambodian boys no older than ten being made to fight each other to the death with their bare hands ,  which i thought was one of the film's most powerful and moving moments .  it says a lot about the reason these guys are the way they are ,  rather than simply condemning them .  also ,  the relationship between chen's character and the girl he meets in the junk yard reveals a lot about his character .  it wasn't until this element entered the film that i really started to see the film as an emotional experience rather than only a visceral one .  there is something about most on screen relationships that doesn't quite get through to me ,  but for some reason this one really did .  the actress does an incredible job with this role which i imagine was not easy to play .   dog bite dog also features some really breathtaking cinematography ,  all though it is unfortunately rather uneven .  there were some moments that i found really striking ,  particularly in the last segment of the film ,  but there was also a good deal of camera work that was just ok .  another slight problem i had was with the pacing ,  which i also felt was uneven .  i found a lot of the  " looking for a boat "  scenes to be a little alienating ,  all though it quickly picks up after that .  the action scenes are short and not too plentiful ,  but are truly powerful and effecting ,  particularly towards the end .  the fight choreography is honestly not all that impressive for the most part ,  all though to its credit it is solid and fairly realistic ,  but the true strength is the emotional content behind the fights .  the final scene ,  while not a marvel of martial artistry or fight choreography ,  is one of the most powerful final fights i have ever seen ,  and i've seen quite a few martial arts films .   i suppose the biggest determining factor of whether or not one will get much out of dog bite dog is whether or not you can connect with the characters .  all of them are certainly some of the more flawed characters one is likely to see in a film of any kind ,  but there was something very human about all of them that i couldn't help but be drawn to and really feel for them ,  particularly chen's girlfriend .  i should say that i doubt most people will like the film as much as i did simply because i imagine that most people will not like or care about the characters in the same way ,  but i still recommend it highly all the same .  it is truly a deeply moving and effecting film if you give it a chance . 
i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an impressive movie without any music .  but it is .  just the pictures .  watch out for that picture :  anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul .  really strong .  might make you feel different . 
i gotta be straight-up - i haven't seen a film as solid as dog bite dog in quite a while .  i'm a big fan of the  " old-school "  late 80s to mid 90s era catiii films ,  and i had been hearing that that  " style "  of films is making a bit of a come-back with films such as this ,  and herman yau's gong tau  ( which as of this writing i have not yet seen .  .  .  )  ,  so i was very interested to give some of these newer-wave catiii films a shot .  did this film live up to my expectations ?  absolutely - but not quite in the fashion that i imagined .   the story follows a young ,  animalistic ,  resourceful and virtually unstoppable thai hit-man with a somewhat vague history who comes to hong kong to complete a  " mission "  .  due to some bad-luck ,  he is quickly identified by a roguish copy  ( who exudes many of the same qualities as our hit-man )  ,  and is quickly apprehended and captured .  this state of affairs doesn't last long though ,  as the un-named assassin escapes from his captors and quickly shows the local police that he is not to be taken lightly .  the hunt is on ,  and a cat-and-mouse game between the police and the  " mad dog "   ( as the police refer to him )  ensues .  along the way ,  mad dog is inadvertently befriended by a slow-witted young woman ,  and a bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a sticky situation .  the ante keeps getting upped as mad dog's only objective is to get out of hong kong and back to thailand by any means necessary ,  and the cops keep trying to reel him in alive .  .  .   i could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered film ,  but i don't want to give too much away .  i watched dog bite dog knowing nothing about the premise ,  and i think it's the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way .  as to comparisons to the older-style catiii films .  .  . there are some similarities .  dog bite dog has some hyper-violent moments reminiscent of the  " good ol' days "  ,  but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as old-school classicks like the untold story or red to kill .  where many of the older catiii films' main intention was to  " shock "  - dog bite dog is a far more thought-out and well-rounded production  ( though that's not to take anything away from those catiii films that i hold so dear .  .  .  )  .  this film is far more  " emotional "  than it is exploitative ,  and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds ,  the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides .  there really are no clear-cut  " good "  and  " bad "  guys ,  as mad dog shows moments of extreme compassion ,  and the cops stoop to extremely unorthodox methods to try to flesh out the killer .  there's also no nudity/sex in this film ,  which is a typical characteristic of the older catiii films .  personally ,  i would compare dog bite dog more to park's sympathy for mr .  vengeance or perhaps the pang brother's bangkok dangerous ,  as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and unflinching action and violence .  again - there's pretty much nothing that i didn't like about this film .  the acting is dead-on ,  the cinematography is sharp and well done ,  and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that isn't seen very often .  is this film  ( and others like it .  .  .  )  the  " rebirth "  of the catiii film - not exactly - but it is a very solid film that's absolutely worth checking out .  .  . 9/10
those individuals familiar with asian cinema ,  as a whole ,  are aware that japan is renowned ,  or notorious ,  for it's hyper-violent films and korea is now garnering a reputation for viciously brutal films .  dog bites dog ,  while not necessarily getting as hyper-violent as the craziest miike film ,  nor is it as unapologetically brutal as some koreas more ambitious efforts ,  it is a perfect in between with its own brand of brutality all it's own .  the greatest strength this film has though ,  like the greatest of the japanese or korean efforts ,  is that the brutality ,  rather than detracting from the film ,  actually develops the characters ,  if not ,  pushing the story forward .  the two main characters are both incredibly vicious individuals with their own motivations and emotional underpinning for being as such .  sam lee's character ,  for instance ,  is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely ,  amidst various encounters with chang's character ,  it is revealed why he is .  without spoiling this part of the story too much ,  it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father .  chang's character ,  on the other hand ,  has his most primal instincts honed to ,  if not perfection ,  brutal efficiency .  surprisingly ,  chang's story arch ,  while not necessarily revealing a more human side ,  actually reveals a side to our animal nature which many forget about which is the natural ability to recognize a fellow broken animal  ( and no i am not talking about sam lee ,  rather pei pei's garbage dump girl character )  .  ultimately however ,  for the first 80 minutes or so ,  it is a ,  more or less ,  straight forward cat and mouse ,  or dog chase dog ,  film in which every encounter ends in at least one death  ( seriously ,  once sam lee and chang square off ,  some one will die )  and the fun part of movie is you never know who hands will commit the act .  which brings us to the film's one weakness .  unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but ,  to put it simply ,  it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since ,  rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minutes into the film ,  the film goes on for another 20 minutes or so to further emphasize it .  don't get me wrong ,  if transitioned better from the 80 minute mark to the climax and if the final act wasn't filled with sweet music  ( in fact if it ,  like the majority of the film ,  kept the music to the barest minimum and let the disturbing sound effects do their job )  ,  it still could have worked and not detract from the film .  as it is though ,  despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters ,  the way it was handled made it feel tacked on ,  and almost ,  insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across .  nevertheless ,  it is still a breath of fresh air from hong kong cinema since even the most bloody of the martial arts films never reaches the level of viciousness and brutality while keeping the the character archs in tact . 
wow .  if you think that a film can't fatigue in some way ,  then you haven't seen dog bite dog .  this film pulls no punches ,  and it doesn't shy away from showing very disturbing images at all .  much like salo ,  this one shows us the dehumanization of the human spirit .  it is gritty ,  dark ,  depressing and hopeless ,  but it is also one of the best films to ever come out of hong kong .   the script is much more of the same ,  but don't go on thinking it is incredibly clichéd .  it basically is about a troubling and obsessive detective in a cat and mouse game ,  against a professional and emotionless hit-man .  while the script offers nothing new on the surface ,  it does provide a lot of questions about the dark side of humanity .  is violence really that necessary ?  do we become more or less human when we abuse a 5 year old child ,  without pity ,  without remorse ?  in turn ,  we humans act no less than rabid dogs when we are blinded by anger ,  this is a sad truth .  it is a topic that the director brilliantly explores ,  without limiting himself at all .  besides the cat and mouse chase ,  the script also develops two separate story lines for the main characters .  one is about love ,  and the other is about redemption .  even if the script isn't that new ,  it is still wonderfully written and it keeps you glued to the seat at all times .    the acting is really ,  really good .  edison chen as the hit-man is incredible ;  he proves that he isn't just any pretty face .  he is ruthless ,  vile and beyond likable .  sam lee as the obsessed cop is also outstanding .  the supporting cast ,  in short ,  is excellent .  the music is also worth mentioning .  very somber score by ben cheung ,  with some effective light hearted songs played at key dark moments in the film .  the cinematography by yuen man is also really good .   overall ,  this catiii film is highly recommended .  very well paced ,  incredibly acted ,  marvelously scored and just really good at the end of it all .  however ,  as many have pointed out ,  this is not a movie for everyone .  if you dislike strong violence then you should stay away from this one .  if you don't like seeing heavy negativity in film then this isn't for you too .  in the end ,  a powerhouse film ,  8/10 . 
this has to be one of the best movies to come out of hk in a long time ,  i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title .  loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with sam lee's impossibly believable insane behavior and edison's portrayal of a killer machine ,  which totally reversed his normal idol image .  i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie .  however ,  i must warn you ,  this is also an equally depressing movie ,  as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own ,  and struggling to breathe .  makes you think about what is life about really . 
it's remarkable and quite praiseworthy how writers and directors continue to make great movies out of one of the oldest and most  ( over ) used story lines in cinema !   " dog bite dog "  is basically not much more than just the simple story of an lone copper obsessively chasing a brilliant criminal ,  only pou-soi cheang distinguishes his film from the rest by being extremely violent & relentless .  this is unquestionably one of the grittiest and most uncompromising movies i've ever seen ,  with an atmosphere of constant nihilism and characters that seem to come walking straight out of hell !  not even the installments in chan-wook park's trilogy of vengeance  ( with the exception of  " oldboy "  ,  perhaps )  or any other infamous cat-iii film ever released were as sadistic and brutal as some of the events depicted in  " dog bite dog "  .  pang is a young and ruthless cambodian assassin who lands in the crowded streets of hong kong to eliminate the wife of an eminent judge in a restaurant .  when the police arrives at the place ,  young officer wai sees how pang hastily flees from the scene of the crime and follow him .  the first actual confrontation between the two rabid dogs results in a gigantic blood bath ,  as pang mercilessly kills several hostages and even wai's long time friend and colleague .  from then on begins a thrilling and action-packed cat and mouse game between the frustrated cop and the professional killer .  the latter also saves a young girl from the constant sexual abuse of her father and stays with her at her shed in the local garbage dump .  what makes this routine action/thriller so fascinating  ( apart from the explicit violence )  are the main characters' backgrounds !  pang ,  the hit-man ,  is a cambodian orphan and has been trained to fight & kill for money ever since he was a child .  he knows no restrictions ,  has no mercy and barely speaks a word .  wai ,  the cop ,  became particularly ruthless and unorthodox ever since his role-model father  ( also a cop )  lies in a coma after a drug-related incident .  lai doesn't question suspects and witnesses ;  he yells at them and he's prepared to sacrifice everything in order to stop his brand new nemesis .  people with a weak stomach or tangled nerves are advised to stay away from this film ,  because the cruelty and shocks featuring in  " dog bite dog "  can easily cause nausea .  it's not the type of violence where bloodied heads and chopped off limbs fly through the air ,  but more like the intense and utterly disturbing type where people attempt to crush their opponents mentally as well as physically .  the filming locations are effectively dark and eerie and the extremely sober music makes the already harrowing tone of the movie even more petrifying .  the performances are terrific !  i wouldn't be surprised if edison chen and sam lee treated each other like enemies on the film set as well ,  because their on screen hatred and disgust feels a little too legitimate .   " dog bite dog "  is a powerful and unforgettable film ,  highly recommended if you can stomach it .  if you fear you can't ,  just wait a few years for the inevitable american remake which will unquestionably soften the premise a little . 
one of the most nihilistic and brutal films i've ever seen ,  but also one of the most tragic and moving ones .  this is an action-melodrama like the world has never seen it before .  sometimes the plot got me close to tears ,  while in the next moment delivering shocking revelations like a bone-crunching blow to the guts .  chilling performance by edison chen .  the story of a hk-cop and a cambodian killer hunting each other down ,  while bit by bit losing their humanity ,  is a strong one .  featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camera-work ,   " dog bite dog "  is pure hk-bloodshed without the heroism . 
finally we have before us a category iii movie for the summer 2006 season .  made of equal parts cruelty ,  crime and passion ,  dog bite dog benefits not merely from an apt title ,  but also flexible direction ,  superb cinematography and respectable performances from most involved .  of course there has to be a catch ,  manifested here in the form of several glaring inconsistencies ,  yet all told dbd represents the mature spirit we'd love to see more of in the hk mainstream .   it also marks the heralded return of edison chen ,  long absent since the initial d debacle of a year ago .  chen's reserved machismo does wonders for the movie ,  yet would have had it rough without opposite sam lee ,  whose knack for alternating between physical comedy  ( crazy 'n' the city ,  no problem 2 )  and lunatic menace has culminated in the strongest role we've seen from him since made in hong kong .   together ,  the duo makes dog bite dog ,  and hopefully edison's going to get an easier break from now on as a consequence :  his touch transformed projects from princess d to the infernal affairs saga ,  and still he remains a rare occurrence .   mostly upon commencing ,  dbd showcases some mesmerizing imagery ,  playing gorgeous tricks with light ,  shadow and perspective .  the soundtrack boosts this atmospheric effect ,  adding to the overall unreal mood the film purveys .  much of the resultant combination probably has to do with writer matt chow ,  previously engaged in likewise gruesome three extremes .  dog bite dog retains numerous traits recalled from that horror project ,  namely rundown urbanscapes and a pervasive air of something eerie lurking round the corner .   rest assured ,  though ,  this isn't a horror movie ,  instead following a path trodden before by classic one nite in mongkok ,  albeit from a miles more perverse angle .  replacing daniel wu's reluctant mainland assassin character we have edison ,  playing a nameless killing machine hailing from cambodia's underworld .  sent hong kong-way to execute a single target ,  the nearly silent assassin takes care of business immediately upon arrival ,  a process chillingly depicted courtesy of the film's brilliant visuals .   although weaned from childhood to become a professional killer ,  edison's eponymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail ,  picked up on by a cid team sent to investigate .  this assembly features a nice cameo by mob-movie stalwart lam suet ,  and good support from tv star wayne lai .  however ,  sam lee's renegade officer wai leads the charge ,  revealing himself to be a highly disturbed individual but excellent cop nonetheless .  we gradually learn wai's inner-conflict stems from his father's police corruption background ,  evoking demons handy in the relentless pursuit that ensues .   a minor body count transpires ,  as edison seems to consider taking prisoners a no-no .  there's quite the violence quotient in store ,  even though gore per se feels toned down in places ,  and adult language only makes a token appearance .  once more ,  no nudity ,  leading one to conclude cat iii's are being handed these days a bit hastily .  still ,  dbd's a relatively mature theatrical release ,  and we applaud its arrival .   in between the fighting ,  stabbing  ,  hacking and shooting ,  even a career murderer needs some romance ,  and just like daniel wu had cecilia cheung in one nite ,  so does intrepid mr .  chen get a sweetheart ,  done beautifully by new comer pei pei .  her unnamed character  ( lots of anonymity in this one )  meets edison's at a strangely deserted landfill ,  abused by her father to the point of repulsive madness and yearning for escape .  when the killer ditches hk ,  he agrees to take her with him ,  and they go on the run together ,  love blooming en route .  while the movie doesn't linger on lovey-dovey stuff ,  our hearts go out to pei pei's tragic character and her endless suffering .  she renders the timid but valiant protagonist amazingly well ,  establishing that there aren't any good or bad guys here ,  evinced by the highly sobering finale .   director cheang soi's portfolio includes recent suspense thriller home sweet home and love battlefield with eason chan ,  two numbers likely surpassed in most accounts by dog bite dog's sinister demeanor .  cheang manages to keep dbd flowing throughout ,  and considering the many parts in play here ,  stands up to critical standards erected by people like johnny to in his watershed nocturnal epic the mission .  a couple of glitches do come about ,  to wit edison miraculously shrugging off a shot to the chest ,  but these are highly forgivable .   marking triumphant returns for two young ,  talented performers of the kind hong kong needs if we want the city's movie heyday to come back ,  dog bite dog doesn't stand out for story .  its forte lies in strong portrayals and style ,  buoyed along on the strength of thespian muscle and a keen eye for visual and auditory finesse .   hk has a long ,  time-honored tradition of stories to do with the city's nighttime alter-ego ,  something dog bite dog upholds lovingly ,  amounting to a solid run if not an outright masterpiece .   rating :  * * * *
as others have mentioned ,  all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous .  the plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido .  when men are around they want to be pursued ,  but when no  " men "  are around ,  they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy .  and the boy becomes a man really fast  ( we should all be so lucky at this age !  )  .  he then gets up the courage to pursue his true love . 
most reviews say that this is the weakest point in hamilton's short movie career .  this movie is a bit different from the rest ,  and considering it the best or the worst depends on what you expect from a movie ,  and what you expect from hamilton .   knowing hamilton as a photographer ,  you can be slightly surprised .  while bilitis looks like his books in a movement with all those young girls discovering themselves and relations with each other on the edge of lesbian ,  with a plot connecting these scenes ,  laura concentrates on few characters what enables developing relations among them  ( male-female ,  artist-model )  but though we see beautiful photos ,  many of them better than his average ,  their number is reduced for the sake of the plot .  tendres cousines is different from both ,  it is only hamilton's movie that looks more like a film than like a collection of moving photos .  because of that it can be acceptable to wider audience than hamilton's fans ,  looking like an erotic comedy  ( but not german soft-core type -  " schulmädchen report "  fans would be very disappointed )  .  you won't laugh a lot ,  but you can smile  ( and that's something you don't often get from hamilton )  .  unlike all other hamilton's movies the age of female varies .  unlike other movies main character is a boy .  unlike his usual works this one isn't put out of place and out of time .  we have characters that live their life ,  have their destiny and don't lead us only from one photo to another ,  from one nude girl to another .   unfortunately ,  hamilton  ( again )  gets lost with a script in his hands .  girls on beaches ,  under shower ,  in low-light rooms ,  in gardens ,  under tents ,  in front of mirrors ,  regardless of the amount of clothes - this is his territory ,  he can shoot minutes and hours ,  and whatever he does you'll always feel the artist's eye and hand behind it .  but when he has to present us average everyday life he stops being hamilton and becomes average director who just follows the script .  hamilton is best known for his nudes ,  but they are just a part of his work .  and in tendres cousines we have a reverse situation :  his girls are not in the best shots .  nature ,  garden ,  house remind us on hamilton's work  ( often neglected part of it )  ,  while girls ,  even when nude ,  don't have anything special in the way he presents us .  maybe hamilton was confused having a boy in front of camera ,  maybe he was thinking about a line that censorship would accept ,  maybe he was really trying to make something new  ( and no one dared to tell him he shouldn't )  ,  but he neglected what he was mostly praised for . 
i like david hamilton's artistic photographs of nude women at the border of womanhood ,  sometimes erotic ,  though never pornographic .  someone else liked them ,  too ,  because my david hamilton books were stolen .  in one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy ,  obviously nude ,  intimate with a young woman older than he ,  also nude .  though discrete ,  there was strong sexual connotation .  new territory for david hamilton which proved to be either stills from the movie tendres cousines or perhaps photos taken on set .   the art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography .  soft focus becomes out-of-focus and discrete angles become confusing ,  perhaps because ,  in motion ,  they cannot be considered .  you either see it or miss it and there's no time to observe ,  to comprehend .  the movie is supposed to be a farce ,  and funny things do happen ,  but it doesn't  " hang together ,  "  perhaps because the story develops so slowly and one may wonder just what's going on .  eventually ,  the 14-year-old julien has intercourse with his cousin ,  but it's soft core ,  with no genital contact shown on camera .  since it's a farce ,  we have a disappointing virgin and an embarrassing caught in the act gag and ,  having caught them ,  julien's father even gives him a cigarette to complete the experience .  in fairness ,  the film is in french and conforms to french cinematic forms ,  which may just be too subtle for most americans even with english subtitles to help us phillistines along .   it's been suggested that this film is child pornography and that certainly results from today's climate where sexual exploitation of children is clearly a serious problem .  nobody in their right mind wants to endorse or appear to endorse the sexual abuse of children ,  so there's practically no room left for children to be seen in even the mildest erotic context without immediately activating alarms over sexual violence and exploitation .  guys will think  " lucky julien !  "  even as they agree that sex and children in the movies is a  " bad thing ,  "  all the while still wishing they could have been a julien at that age .  women ,  too ,  may have similar thoughts ,  but all such considerations must be pushed out of one's conscious mind .  hysterically ,  the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are rigorously avoided .  too bad ,  since sexual awakening is a real human experience .  afer all ,  children do grow up and become sexual beings as julien does .  it's a fit literary subject ,  cinema included ,  but taboo under the threat of sexual violence against children .  david hamilton ,  i think ,  was taking a risk to make a movie on this topic even in 1980 .  he was somewhat successful at exploring this sensitive topic ,  and ,  unfortunately ,  we're unlikely to see better in the near future for fear of the child pornography label . 
this movie documents the harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties .  much more fun than than palazzo volpi ,  though just as diseased ,  this movie is a true gem of squalor .  one cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness  .  the sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz .  here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized .  the characters' penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer ,  creating a  " phenomenon of a phenomenon "  effect which makes this movie a piece of art . 
after growing up in the gritty streets of detroit ,  mi ,  and having friends who traveled to new york balls ,  i fell into the lifestyle of being a house member .  i joined the house of theieves .  we adapted the same rules as most houses ,  but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewels and clothes we desired .  i even learned how to profess the making of checks and driver's license and cash them in over seventeen states ,  until a jealous queen called the secret service on me and i went to federal prison .  but ,  i learned a lot from these queens in this movie and i highly recommend you watch it yourself .  you can even read about how i grew up in the houses here in detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in .  my book ,  identity schemes is available on sale at amazon dot com or at identity schemes dot com .  but trust me ,  it is a lot better than paris is burning ,  because its a 2005 make . 
i waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when i first saw it over 10 years ago ,  i wanted to think carefully about what i wanted to write .    i found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary .  it did what it set out to do ,  show me something i had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored .  i knew nothing of the drag world and finding out about them and the  " balls "  was just spectacular to me .  these folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it ,  for competition .  the catty folks ,  the complainers  ( even i was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the drag queen was wearing wasn't a man's coat !  )  ,  the jealous ,  it's all there like in every other competition .  like every other competition like it .  which i felt was a point .   you had the older drag queen talking about how the balls  " used "  to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the balls and made more competition categories -- and even those who looked on knowing that the future of balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway .  it was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete ,  it was that important to them !  then there was sad stories ,  stories of who's  " house "  and  " house mother "  brought out the best and the brightest in competition .  it was interesting .   now to add after 10 years of seeing this film ,  i lived through the so called 'madonna' craze .  i spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with madonna during her  " vogue "  phase and rightfully so .  if not for those individuals ,  madonna wouldn't have had a  " vogue "  phase ,  i know that now .  credit should be given where credit is due .  makes me wonder ,  if anyone else from mainstream america would watch this documentary ,  they'll learn they're not as  " mainstream "  as they think . 
yeah this films is tops .  cant recommend it more .  gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film .  very funny ,  sad and interesting .  never dull .  great access .  a film made with passion and interest in the subject matter .  some of the performances and just amazing .  if you only find this film on vhs it is still very worth watching .  great .  10 out of 10 .  i got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what i was watching .  the interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy- weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto .  the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement .  cool .  track it down . 
wonderfully put together .  . i wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost .  .  . there should be a part two .  . a real one .  it was great .  . the film wasn't long enough .  . i would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up !  !  this is so important to the community period .  . well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort .  .  . i am really tired of hearing from naive writers how aids and men go together when they don't ;  actually its the hetero's that we need to look into .  . this film didn't even bother to mention hiv or aids and i was so glad for that .  . i really appreciated the break downs and definitions too .  thank you s much for allowing this film to exist . 
the film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in .  it is well made and very powerful .  the persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective .  i believe it give great insight into a sub-culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society .  it is shocking at times and more powerful because of it .  some parts were difficult to watch ,  as most reality is ,  but it is not over done .  its good the first time you watch it ,  but it becomes even better the second or third time around ;  because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge . 
fifteen years later and paris is burning is still aflame .  this is a classic in black gay films ,  right up there with the other honorary black gay films ,  the color purple and mahoganoy .  this seminal work captures underground and underclass  ( i . e .  " underserved )  black and latin gay culture and community like no other work before or since ,  including all the sentimental harlem rennaissance gay retrospectives and renderings .  they're good ,  but this is the best  ( dare i say the only  " real "  )  film you'll find on the subject .  it's relentlessy cunty  ( the classic house music invention ) comes to hollywood ,  non-stop ,  hilarious camp  ( like only we do it )  and dead-on social critique .  all this by a white female director  ( who obviously must have been a sister gurl or mizz thing in a former life .  )  i could go on ,  but i think you get the point by now :  i love this movie ! 
when paris is burning came out ,  i totally dismissed it .  i was not into the whole madonna and vogueing phenomenon .  i thought it was going to be campy and silly .  how wrong i was about this movie .  i watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and i ran out and bought it .  it took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement .  i felt as though i knew all of the characters personally .  the 80s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture .  what a terrific job !  i went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but i have not been able to locate all of them .  if any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know .    i hope they make another documentary .  i loved it
growing up in nyc in the late 80's/early 90's club-scene ,  i can personally say this is one of the most important documentaries made in covering that place in this time period .  no madonna did not come up with the idea of voguing but this is where she got it from !  instead of taking out violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights ,  voguing allowed people to  " fight "  within the confines of everything short of touching each other  ( which would warrant an automatic disqualification )  .  seeing these kind of extraordinarily talented/well orchestrated  " throw-downs "  in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names from back in the day are here .  .  . pepper la beija ,  paris duprée , xtragavaganza ,  etc .  .  . all commemorated in the likes of such period-pieces as malcom mclaren's song  " deep in vogue "  .  .  . it didn't matter who you were ,  or where you were from because when you walked through those doors into this  " magic kingdom "  of sorts ,  you became part of something bigger than yourself/you were important/and most importantly the creation of your own moves and imagination .  .  . and anybody from anywhere could become king  ( or queen )  as the case may have been .  the words and wit were just as sharp as the moves on the floor .  all of the tension ,  excitement ,  and magic of that very urban nyc energy is captured in this film .  brilliant !  !  !  please release on dvd for the world to see !  !  !  thank you ! 
wow !  i have seen so many bad low budget films lately ,  but this one is great .  the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series .  i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent cliché about the police .  this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time .  a perfect tradeoff ! 
documentary starts in 1986 in nyc where black and hispanic drag queens hold  " balls "  .  that's where they dress up however they like ,  strut their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on .  we get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other .  as one man says to another-- " you have three strikes against you--you're black ,  gay and a drag queen "  .  these are people who  ( sadly )  are not accepted in society--only at the balls .  there they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted .  then the film cuts to three years later  ( 1989 )  and you see how things have changed  ( tragically for some )  .    sounds depressing but it's not .  most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations .  they're well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor--just as they should .  we find out they all live in  " houses "  run by various  " mothers "  and all help each other out .  the sense of community in this film is fascinating .   when this film came out in 1990 it was controversial--and a big hit .  it won best documentary awards at numerous festivals--but was never even nominated for an academy award .  their reason was  " black and hispanic drag queens are not academy material "  .  fascinating isn't it ?  homophobia and racism all together .    seen today it's still a great film--and a period piece .  it just isn't like that anymore--the ny they show no longer exists .  the balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here .  also drag has become more  " accepted "  in society  ( for better or worse )  .  and i've heard the houses are gone too .  that's kind of sad .  i would like to know where these characters are now--i know two died of aids but i have no idea about the others .  and what did happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown ?    still ,  it a one of a kind documentary--fascinating ,  funny and riveting .  a must see all the way !  a definite 10 .  where's the dvd ?  ?  ? 
an excellent documentry .  i personally remember this growing up in nyc in the early 80's .  this movie is for anyone that wasn't around during that time period . this shows the one thing the african american gay underclass felt was solely theirs and the love and camadrie you see is real .  the people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written .  the balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the nineteen eighties .  that time is gone forever .  this is a good pre  " homo thug "  movie .  when queens were really proud to be extroverts .  goodbye to storyville this is another era gone but greatly documented all hail film ! 
this film came out 12 years years ago ,  and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in new york .  the textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses .  anthony slide's 'great pretenders' says nothing .  julian fleisher's  " the drag queens of new york :  an illustrated field guide "  with its flow chart of influence that pulls together julian eltinge ,  minette ,  the warhol queens ,  and the 90s club scene - and postdates the film - ignores the houses completely .  even laurence senelick's  " the changing room "  - the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it .   i understand from the film itself , and various articles i found on the web that this house system goes back decades .  the major film performance by a house member prior to 1990 seems to be chrystal la beija in  " the queen "  ,  1968 .  the historical context is the biggest missing part of  " paris is burning "  .   the film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored .  it is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989 .  the unfortunate fact that venus xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending ,  but this is not the only film about transsexuals to include a real-life murder .  as we now know ,  dorian corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet ,  but this did not come out until three years later .   of historical importance ,  but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context . 
first of all i am a butch ,  straight white male .  but even with that handicap i love this movie .  it's about real people .  a real time and place .  and of course new york city in the 80's .  i had many gay friends growing up in new york in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them .  no matter what the consequences .  that's courageous .  you have to admire that .  this is a great film ,  watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant african american or hispanic gay man in the new york of the eighties .  it's real life .  bottom line it's real life . 
while many unfortunately passed on ,  the ballroom scene is still very much alive and carrying on their legacy .  some are still very much alive and quite well ,  octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever ,  willi ninja is very accomplished and gives a great deal of support to the gay community as a whole ,  pepper labeija just passed on last year of natural cause ,  may she rest in peace .  after anji's passing carmen became the mother of the house of xtravaganza  ( she was in the beach scene )  and she is looking more and more lovely as well .  some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed ,  may they all rest in peace .  there is currently another project underway known as  " how do i look ?  "  ,  you can check out the website at www . howdoilooknyc . org . 
in the beginning of this film ,  one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two strikes against him :  he is black and male .  but in addition to that ,  he has a third strike :  he's gay .   " you're going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined ,  "  he is told .   " paris is burning "  is a documentary about gay black and hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexuals .   the miracle of  " paris is burning "  is that director jennie livingston takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity .  we learn their views of homosexuality ,  men ,  women ,  their hopes ,  their disappointments ,  their dreams .  some of these dreams are so unattainable it's tragic .  many of the people are seriously in denial ;   this is not a film for everyone .  there are shots in this movie of nude transsexuals .  if you have a problem with homosexuality ,  then this movie isn't for you .  but if you do see this movie you'll realise  " paris is burning "  isn't really about men wearing women's clothes ,  it's about a group of people who are routinely marginalised and put down by society at large ,  and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives .   i've watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991 ,  because it says so many things :  it's a commentary about materialism in our culture ,  about gender roles ,  about rich and poor people ,  about the media and what it celebrates ,  about fame and adulation .   " paris is burning "  is one of the most humane ,  and one of the saddest ,  movies i've ever seen . 
this movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men ,  and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer .  few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence ,  and i can think of no other movie -- documentary or drama -- that achieves it .  there is no other movie in which i have both laughed so much and cried so much .  yes ,  it is about dmd and accessible travel ;  on those issues alone ,  it is a worthwhile venture ,  but it is more .  it is about friendship .  it is about life itself ,  about living every day that you're alive .  and it's a great ,  fun ,  adventurous narrative .  this is why god created the cinema !  see this movie !  !  ! 
this is a must-see documentary movie for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost its taste for real-life adventure and its sense of morality .  darius goes west is an amazing roller-coaster of a story .  we live the lives of darius and the crew as they embark on the journey of a lifetime .  darius has duchenne muscular dystrophy ,  a disease which affects all the muscles in his body .  he is confined to a wheelchair ,  and needs round-the-clock attention .  so how could this crew of young friends possibly manage to take him on a 6 , 000 mile round-trip to the west coast and back ?  watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure - laugh and cry with the crew as they cope with unimaginable challenges along the way ,  and enjoy the final triumph when they arrive back three weeks later in their home town to a rapturous reception and some great surprises ! 
there are many police dramas doing the rounds .  i am not sure why .  it's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil .   this film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of anne ,  a raw recruit ,  into a police squad stationed in the baltic area .  no attempt is made to glamorise the police .  they are truly down to earth ,  harsh at times and unforgiving ,  anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition .  against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations .   this is not a pleasant film .  not one to relax you .  there is not much feeling of optimism in it .  the police seem to be involved in a losing battle .  tomorrow there will be more bashings ,  more murders ,  more family break-ups ,  and more distressed children .  let's face it .  this is the world we live in .   as days go by anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating .  the only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character benny ,  a 12 year old from a broken family .  anne has her own way of patching things up .  she turns a blind eye to benny's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can .  i was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce benny's father .  it set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs .  after all ,  the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children .   well cast but not my idea of an evening's entertainment , 
i tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now i've seen the film !  !  what a ride !  and what a trip to finally get to know darius weems !  such a courageous ,  wise ,  funny and talented spirit !  and what a crew !  to listen to darius laughing from being in the water at panama city ,  to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in louisiana ,  the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon ,  the excitement of rafting through some rapids ,  the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi ,  and the phone calls home ,  and as always - boys will be boys .  this film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike .  darius and his mother are models of strength and courage .  and the crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation .  they got darius a new wheelchair ;  they documented accessibility problems ;  they took darius on the trip of his life ;  and they touched many ,  many lives .  by raising awareness of dmd and encouraging funding for research ,  this film will help accomplish the final goal of darius goes west - a cure for dmd . 
i saw this film at the santa barbara film festival ,  and there was not a dry eye in the house .  it is incredible to see not only what a great person darius is ,  but how admirable the rest of the team is too and at such a young age .   it also made me think how disgusting mtv was ,  and how on being given an opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way ,  they declined .  shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers at all .   it's a wonderful and heart warming true story .  .  . take your tissues but it's great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be . 
this movie is a touching story about an adventure taken by 15-year-old darius weems .  darius has duchenne muscular dystrophy ,  a still un-curable disease that took the life of his brother at age nineteen and is the number one killer of babies in the united states .  him and a few close friends travel across the country to los angeles with the goal of getting his wheelchair customized on mtv's ,  pimp my ride ,  one of his favorite shows .  the journey begins in georgia ,  where darius grew up and has never left .  the gang head west for a trip that all its participants will never forget .  darius gets to ride in a boat for the first time ,  ride in a hot air balloon ,  swim in the ocean and visit sights he's always wanted to see like the grand canyon and new orleans .  the filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material .  they make no money from sales of the $20 dvds .  $17 goes toward researching the disease and $3 goes toward making more copies .  the film has won over 25 awards at festivals and i agree with the quote given to the film by variety ,   " certain to stir hearts "  . 
darius goes west is an amazing documentary about a teenager  ( weems )  with duchenne muscular dystrophy ,  and his 11 friends who take him on a cross-country trip to see if  " pimp my ride "  will pimp out his wheelchair .   i recently watched this movie at the sunscreen film festival .  it played twice over the course of the festival .  this movie is an amazing story about the human spirit ,  and the spirit of weem's friends .  i do not say this often about movies ,  but after watching this movie ,  i feel moved to do something towards the cause .  every festival this movie has taken part in ,  this movie has won an award of some kind .  it is in the tribeca film festival ,  and it is going to london and athens ,  greece .  i would not be surprised if this movie went all the way to the academy awards .  it is snowballing out of control .  if anyone has a chance to see this movie ,  wherever it is playing ,  go !  take as many people as possible ,  and go !  it is heading to new orleans for a film festival ,  then on to atlanta and palm beach ,  fl .  darius is from georgia ,  so i expect the tickets for the atlanta showing will be sold out quickly ,  if they are not already .  please ,  go see this movie !  dgw  ( talk about it )   -kish
darius goes west is a film depicting american belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough .  this wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected ,  but longed to see ,  what was outside the confines of his lovely city of athens ,  ga .  darius wished to see the ocean .  his longtime friends logan ,  ben and several other good friends decided to make darius' wish come true .  they started small - ben & logan's mom started an email campaign to bring awareness to darius' condition :  duchenne muscular dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellas to take darius to not only see the ocean but to see these great united states .  to say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement .  they realized darius' dream and then some .  they put their lives on hold while showing love ,  care and tons of fun to darius while helping darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others suffering from dmd .  darius went on to volunteer for the red cross - sitting in his chair collecting money  ( along with his buddies )  outside a local grocery store .  his wonderful smile tells the world that dreams do come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you .  give darius and all the guys an oscar - no one else deserves it more .  martha sweeney . 
i have one word to someup this movie ,  wow !  i saw  " darius goes west "  at the tribeca film festival .  people in the theater were sobbing .  this movie shows the hardships that darius sufferes with muscular dystrophy .  the movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie ,  i was so emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy ,  some people in this world are less fortuate then us .  and sometimes we should give them a had and help them ,  to the very end .  i would give them ten stars ,  they gave darius a had when they weren't asked to ,  they did't do it for the money they did it for a friend in need ,  darius ,  the world should know ,  darius went west . 
 " darius goes west "  is the touching story of a brave teen coping with duchenne's muscular dystrophy and his personal quest to see the pacific ocean .  he receives help and encouragement from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this quest .   the story has a natural drama and honest portrayal of the commitment of young people to help one of their own stricken with this incurable disease .   anyone who thinks young people are self-centered and narcissistic will find this movie to turn that stereotype on its head .  it is the power of the young people and their engagement with darius' plight that is very compelling in this documentary . 
well i wasn't sure what the film was going to be like as i had only seen a little clip but i was thinking its going to be good and i was right i watched it twice on the day i got it and well it is my favourite film .   i think alison lohan played the part of beth really well she is such a grate actress and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about bulimia although the ending when beth is in the hospital an has 2 horus observation after meals because iv been told like 1 house is ok and also that hospitals doesn't help bulimics as iv been told which is probably why i'm still at home even tho my sister and mum would like to have me hospitalised as i to have bulimia but this is a grate film i recommend it to any one with or with out an eating disorder or for people who know some one with eating disorders as it can let them in to the lives of a bulimic person and see the world how they do a bit over all a grate film and i recommend it to any one and any type of person
this was the best movie i've ever seen about bulimia .  it hit the exact spot of what bulimia is really about and how it's not always about being skinny and dieting .  it showed how people with bulimia tend to think about things such as their outlook on life ,  friends and themselves .  the best line and the part that really shows what the problem with bulimia is ,  is when beth says ,  " it's not about you !  "  that line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem .  it showed that people with bulimia don't have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else .  it has to do with them and them only .  it shows that it's time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves .  it showed that beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her mom's attention at that time the most . 
this is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in ,  effected by ,  or suffering from an eating disorder .  it is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl ,  its causes and its symptoms .  the girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today ,  alison lohman ,  who was later so spectacular in 'where the truth lies' .  i would recommend that this film be shown in all schools ,  as you will never see a better on this subject .  alison lohman is absolutely outstanding ,  and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder .  if barometers tell us the air pressure ,  alison lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy .  her emotional range is so precise ,  each scene could be measured microscopically for its gradations of trauma ,  on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation which reaches unbearable intensity .  mare winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother ,  and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as lohman's .  together ,  they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another .  this film is really an astonishing achievement ,  and director katt shea should be proud of it .  the only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people .  but even if you like nature films best ,  this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge .  bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair .  and if we don't sympathise with people suffering from the depths of despair ,  then we are dead inside . 
this is a movie that has a lot of things that only japanese people can understand .  even well translated ,  there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism .  my guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort ,  but that just got wasted on me .   what i felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects .  some kid becomes  " the one "  and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway .  it would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about ,  but between the azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella  ( rihanna eat your heart out !  )  i couldn't really discern the plot .   bottom line :  nice visuals ,  the kid screams a lot ,  the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap . 
if you havn't seen this movie i highly recommend you do . it's an excellent true story . i love alison lohman she is so talented side note :  i also loved her in 7th heaven . the whole story line is amazing and the way they chose there characters waz awesome .  the acting in this film is  very awesome . 
this was a pretty good movie ,  i liked it .  i thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it's not about dieting ,  it's about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this .  beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling .  i also think one of the best lines in the movie is where beth yells the words ,   " it's not about you .  "  to her mother .  those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie .  i think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie . 
i cried my heart out ,  watching this movie .  i have never suffered from any eating disorder ,  but i think this must be a very true picture .   alison lohman is excellent !  she expresses these feelings amazingly well .  my teenage years came back to me so vividly .  anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or teenager will be able to relate to this movie .  i recommend you all to see it !   the music is great too - i've now discovered diana lorden .   i'm also looking forward to seeing alison lohman in white oléander ,  because i am positive she is perfectly suited for the role as agnes . 
i was reviewing some old vhs tapes i have and came across the tv show john denver & the muppets a christmas together . this made me go to my computer and look it up to see if i could find a dvd version of this show to buy .  i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd .  the show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show .  i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show .  the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading ,  the sound is not as good as the cd .  there is also a few other songs not put on the cd .  as a fan of john denver and of the muppets ,  a dvd of this show would really be a good seller .  if you don't have the cd it is a wonderful chritmas collection of songs taken from that show .  the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on . 
this was surprisingly intelligent for a tv movie ,  and quite true to my own experience of bulimia .  it was actually well-researched ,  and i can only assume it was written by someone who's gone through a similar experience ,  because it had all the little details .  the characters were quite well-drawn ,  and the performances by mare winningham and alison lohman were great .  i think what i like most was that they made them specific and smart ,  and there was no dumbing down of the reasons for beth's bulimia  ( it wasn't some  " diet gone out of control ,  caused by the pressures placed on girls by the media ,  pressures we're not actually going to address .  .  .  "  )  .  her mother wasn't completely clueless - too often on television they'll take an issue that everyone has some awareness of and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who don't  (  " diabetes ?  what's that ?  oh ,  my world is all askew ,  doctor ,  please explain it all to me as if i'm a small child "  ,  etc )  .  it was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even she didn't see the signs .  and the scenes where beth was throwing up weren't overly melodramatic and sensationalist ,  and concentrated more on bulimics' need for secrecy ,  and their out-of-controlness .  the scene where beth tells her mother she's bulimic would've made me cry if there hadn't been other people in the room .   okay ,  so i liked those bits .  what didn't work for me so well was the ending ,  which headed back to the tv movie territory we know and don't particularly love ,  but i guess they had to wrap it up .   " you ,  too ,  can cure your child's eating disorder ,  if you have lots and lots of money and live in america .  .  .  "   and can i just say again that i really like mare winningham .  she's great . 
the good thing about this movie :  the concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes .  it also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect the life of someone else without you ever knowing .  its a small world and this little movie shows us .   the bad thing : there are too many characters and its hard to tell who the main character is but its still a great movie .   its a great movie and many people compare it to magnolia which i haven't seen .   8/10  not rated---i would rate it pg-13 for brief violence , some language and sexual situations . 
it is hard to describe bug in words ,  it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood .  it follows a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything i have seen lately in a hollywood release .  as its characters react to the chain of events in different ways ,  and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow ,  the audience is merely an observer .  the almost proustian narrative flow of thought to thought ,  the very spontaneity in the script will have you glued to the screen ,  waiting anxiously to see how it all works out in the end .  and as far as the thematic elements .  .  . there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy ,  to bright and beautiful ,  and then to tragic ,  all within the span of about a minute .  and it works .   this movie is pure magic .  it reminds one why independent film is perhaps the brightest star the film industry currently has .  perhaps with more movies of bug's quality ,  people will start to take notice . 
as a producer of indie movies and a harsh critic of such ,  i have to say i loved this movie .  it is funny and intelligent ,  well directed and entertaining .  hats off to the producers and directors for making a good one !  i'll be watching for the next one .  i gave it a 10 . 
this is a great movie !  most of us have seen jurassic park ,  where the chaos theory is summarized by telling about a butterfly's wings ,  causing a tornado on the other side of the planet .  well ,  bug is all about that  ( or at least something ,  don't worry this is no spoiler )  i'm definitely not a religious type and don't believe in pre-destined stuff ,  fate ,  etc ,  but this movie surely makes you wonder if coincidence really exists .  .  .   further more ,  the acting and camera are excellent too ,  another prove that it's still possible to make a good movie without a zillion bucks
worth watching twice because of the rapid-paced causal shifts among several compelling stories ,   " bug "  emerges as a wholly satisfying work of art that plays ever-optimistic love against myriad examples of frustrating reality .   my favorite characters are wallace  ( john carroll lynch ) whose overriding concern for life--from that of a cockroach to the airline passengers for whom he is partially responsible--frames the film ;  olive  ( christina kirk )  ,  who spends considerable time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband ernie  ( chris bauer )  ;  and mitchell ,  a cable tv technician with unbounded trust in fortune cookie messages :   " you will meet the girl of your dreams .  "   against such optimism are the forces of quirky reality ,  all generated by actions of the characters :  parking tickets ,  a clogged drain in a chinese food/donut shop ,  tv disruption ,  a crushed auto fender ,  an obliterated dinner reservation that eventually results in cancellation of a hawaiian vacation .   the film is funny :  olive getting drunk at a chippendale performance ,  johnston  ( michael hitchcock ) as a customer service rep attempting to deal with an irate customer ,  the germ-obsessive cyr  ( brian cox )  facing a restaurant inspector ,  dwight  ( jamie kennedy )  reacting to his girlfriend's refusal to have children by writing hostile chinese cookie fortunes :   " your girlfriend is lying to you "  and the guy who falls asleep while manning a jackhammer because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend's missing cat .   a minor story with public cable access host  ( darryl theirse )  and a local acting teacher reading from  " the boy in the bubble "  expresses the major theme :  love comes from the heart .    " bug "  entertains on much the same level as  " trains ,  planes and automobiles "  but on a lower budget and with a fresher eye . 
this was a very entertaining movie and i really enjoyed it ,  i don't normally rent movies like these  ( ie .  indie flicks )  however ,  i was attracted to the film because it had an incredible cast which included jamie kennedy ,  whom i have loved since the scream trilogy .  the movie director took a risk  ( and it is a risky risk )  in telling the lives of many  ( and i mean many )  different people and having the intertwine at various intervals .  taking that risk was a good idea because it's end result is an exceedingly good film .    the film has a few main characters ;  dwight  ( jamie kennedy )  - a disgruntled fortune cookie writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is on the rocks because of an argument .  wallace gregory  ( john carroll lynch )  - an airplane loader/technician who has a love for all living things  ( except ,  perhaps meter maids )  and who despite his good heart has an increasing amount of bad luck .  cyr  ( brian cox )  - the owner of a chinese restaurant/donut shop who is a germaphobe and because of is his fear of germs places his assistant/cook sung - ( alexis cruz )  under pressure to keep up with his phobia .  ernie -  ( christopher bauer )  is married to olive -  ( christina kirk )  who he is convinced is trying to ;  stop him have fun ,  look ridiculous ,  go insane ,  and not live a normal life .  they begin to have petty and almost crazy arguments and olive seriously begins to have doubts about ernie .  gordon -  ( grant heslov )  is a man whose life isn't going very well ,  as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand .  mitchel -  ( jon huertas )  is convinced that gwen -  ( alexandra westcourt )  is the girl of his dreams and that they are destined for each other ,  though she is more skeptical .  he attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts !  johnston -  ( michael hitchcock )  has just been fired from his job and has doubts about his role as provider ,  he takes another job that he just isn't suited for .  his wife annelle -  ( arabella field )  is comforting through out his job loss experience until she learns that johnston wasn't quite the loving husband she thought he was .   all in all i definitely suggest this movie !   -erica
i recently bought this movie and i do not regret having it at all as a matter of fact i am very please have this movie to add to my collection .  matt manfredi and phil hay ,  movie directors ,  took less than one month to film and spent about 1 million eur to produce this great movie .  this proves that not only big productions make great movies .   the title of this movie fits in perfectly .  in computer language bug means program error which causes reactions in computer function .  our reactions can cause these negative side effects ,  but also great moments of beauty .  the vertiginous happenings in this movie start with the death of a bug .  a man witnesses the  " crime "  on the other side of the road .  .  . from there onwards everything gets complicated .  .  .   i point out john carrol lynch  (  " fargo "  )  ,  wallece ,  the man who cannot make everything right at all . 
ok so a 10 for a 2 1/2 star movie you ask ?  .  .  . well see this one and maybe it will make more sense .  .  hitchcock never blended scenes together better .  .  .  . the film weaves scenes together flawlessly from the start and yet you don't get that scattered feeling you sometimes get when a movie runs you through the many characters it attempts to develop .  you sense that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they don't disappoint you when they do .  screenwriter/producer phil hay's surreal tale of life ,  blended with an absolutely superb soundtrack makes you think more about the 6 degrees of separation in life than the movie by the same title .  .  . i will be looking for more good things from this producer in the future . 
the only reason i'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played tadashi's tormentors were not up to the job .  i presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy ,  but they were not well coached ,  and their scenes were a minor annoyance .    i say not to judge this by u . s .  standards because it's full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that japanese culture readily embraces ,  and is not beholden to the black-hat/ white-hat moral constraints u . s .  kids' films are routinely subjected to .  for example ,  there is a preciously funny moment when tadashi's small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai ,  and shojo--the avuncular kirin herald--does what many a stressed-out japanese adult would do .  hint :  this would not happen in a disney film .  this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids' movie .    early on ,  there's a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book .  there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this movie came out .  it was a stop-motion clay animation about a kid who's depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room .  his mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up .  then ,  someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune ,  but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead .  i mention this commercial ,  because it was considered funny ,  and i didn't hear any objections to it while i was there .  there is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in  " the great yokai war "  than one would find in a disney movie .  as a parent ,  if this were a u . s .  film ,  i would be up in arms about such things ,  although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture ,  which ,  of course ,  are also not black and white .  since it's a japanese movie ,  i accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a u . s .  production .  however ,  i'd probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of pre-show briefing and/or post-show debriefing about the violence and other off- color stuff ,  or i'd wait till they're older to show it to them . 
there are so many  " hollywood "  movies made now that are not only torture to watch ,  but also have no bearing on anyone's life ,  whatsoever .  granted ,  movies don't always have to have deep meaning ,  but it's nice to know that there are still film-makers out there who care about telling  " human "  stories .  i won't give away the premise of this brilliant film ,  however ,  the screenplay is surely one of the more complex and memorable ones i have ever seen in my life ,  and i'm a 32-year-old film buff too !  bug ranks top ten on my list of favorites ,  which includes :  on the waterfront ,  sunset boulevard ,  and black narcissus ,  to name just a few .  this  " moving "  movie should become one of your favorites also- that is ,  if you have a heart ! 
i last night i had the pleasure of seeing the movie bug at the florida film festival and let me say it was a real treat .  the directors were there and they did a q&a afterwards .  the movie begins with a young boy smashing a roach beneath his foot ,  a man who is nearby parking his car sees the young boy smash it and runs to ask the kid `why ?  why ?  did he have to kill that living creature ? ' in his rush to counsel the youth in the error of his ways ,  the man neglects to pay his parking meter ,  which starts off a whole chain of events involving people not at all related to him ,  some funny ,  some sad ,  and some ridiculous .  this movie has a lot of laughs ,  lots !  and there are many actors which you will recognize .  the main actors who stood out in the film for me were :  jamie kennedy  ( from his comedy show the jamie kennedy experiment ,  playing a fortune cookie writer ;  john carroll lynch  ( who plays drew's cross dressing brother on the drew carey show )  playing the animal loving guy who just can't get it right ;  brian cox  ( the original hannibal lecter in manhunter )  playing the germaphobic owner of a donut and chinese food take out joint .  there is one line where cox tells his chef to wash off some pigs blood that is on the sidewalk by saying  " clean up that death "  which is quite funny mostly because of cox's  " obsessed with germs "  delivery .  the funniest moment in the movie comes when a young boy imitates his father ,  whom he heard earlier in the day yell out `motherf*****' ,  while in the classroom .  another extremely funny and surreal scene is when trudie styler  ( mrs .  sting herself )  and another actor perform a scene on a cable access show ,  from the film the boy in the plastic bubble .  the actor who hosts the cable access show is just amazing he is so serious and deadpan and his performance as both the doctor and the boy in the plastic bubble is enthralling .  there are many other fine and funny actors and actresses in this film and having shot it in less than a month with a budget of just about $1 million ,  the directors phil hay and matt manfredi  ( who are screenwriters by trade ,  having written crazy/beautiful and the upcoming tuxedo starring jackie chan )  have achieved a film that is great ,  funny and endearing . 
i just watched this movie on showtime .  quite by accident actually .  if i wouldn't have only had 6 hrs of sleep for the past two days then i wouldn't have came home early from work .  if i hadn't came home early from work i wouldn't have seen this movie .  i wouldn't have known what i was missing ,  but i would've missed a lot .   that's the way this movie is .  it's almost playing on the kevin bacon effect .  that and causality  ( hence my verbiage above )  .  ever character is intertwined in some way or another .  action ,  reaction ,  interaction ,  non-interaction .  this movie is just wonderful .  i'm going to have to find a copy to buy . 
hmmmm ,  want a little romance with your mystery ?  this has it .  i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie .  but how could the romance be ditched when the story's borrowed from something called a harlequin romance novel ,  whatever the heck that is .  had the romance been ditched ,  the story might have been a little too weak .  the mystery here wasn't too bad ,  quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage .  oh well .  i thought mel harris was pretty good ;  her short skirts ,  i think ,  added some sex appeal .  .  .  but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast ,  maybe with a more well known tv movie actor .  the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on - both could have been a little edgier ,  a little darker ,  more adventurous .  one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations .  that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like budapest .  possibly a drawback was the director and/or cinematographer's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect .  not good .  had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen ,  picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background .  this was just a tv-movie ,  though ,  so they had to add some ummmph to the picture and some of that ummmph came from the scenery .  overall ,  twasn't really a bad movie .  i'll tell you what ,  this was absolutely the best canadian-hungarian production i have ever seen !   ( and the only that i know of .  )  i hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made-for-tv movie ,  giving it a grade of c-
the movie i thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in between .   rob stewart is a wonderful actor i don't know why people keep giving him a bad rap .  as for mel harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for rob it's only by five years .   rob had a lead role in his own tv series as well as one on the scifi channel .  i'm sure you remember topical heat aka sweating bullets and painkiller jane .   he also starred in a number of tv movies and is now making a tv mini series .   they need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at . 
on first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened ,  but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear .  i enjoyed this movie .  dean cain was excellent in the role of bob .  lexa doig's character was confusing to understand ,  at first ,  she was out to trap bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart .  dean cain's performance was an usual excellent .  he gets better with every film he does .  my only question at the end of the film was what happened to bob ,  camilla and the baby .  it was left for the viewer to decide
warning !  spoilers ahead !    spoilers   i've seen movie in german ,  so it might be ,  that i missed some clues .    despite some weakness in the plot ,  it's a movie that came through to me .  i liked especially lexa doig's acting .  sometimes i got impression ,  that she *is* camille .  but i can't stop wondering ,  what happened at the end with bob ,  cassie and baby .  i belive ,  she ,  after initially being set on bob ,  eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him .  otherwise it's a bit strange ,  that she would carry his baby and love it .  it's up to viewer to decide - and i don't like such endings .  dean cain was as good as ever ,  eric roberts  .  .  well ,  i've seen him better but also worse .    i believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story .    bottom line is ,  i liked it very much . 
this is by far the funniest short made by the two comic geniuses .  from the time they walk in ,  to the time hardy just falls off the roof ,  this keeps me laughing hysterically .  i highly suggest that every fan of laurel and hardy should see this short .  i also recommend all of the ghost series .  if you are looking for laughs ,  see this movie and you will be happy . 
some of my favorite laurel and hardy films have very ,  very little plot .  instead ,  they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious !  films such as help mates and busy bodies are among the funniest as you see the boys working or cleaning house .  here in dirty work ,  most of the film is akin to these other two films--stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying  ( quite unsuccessfully )  to clean a crazy professor's chimney .  seeing ollie fall through the chimney ,  the boys making the house a total mess and the insane behaviors of stanley all work together to make a very pleasing film .   however ,  in an odd twist ,  there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie .  it seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger .  late in the film ,  you see him make a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg !  given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room ,  is it any surprise what happens next ?  while this subplot was unnecessary ,  it worked well enough .  what worked exceptionally well was the middle portion .  give the boys nothing exciting to do and you'll be amazed at the hilarious results .  one of the team's better films and it almost earns a 9 . 
i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i was so impressed . everything about it was superb .  the acting the characters ,  the story .  a believable child who grew into brave ,  always willing to help others .  his mum must be proud .  i could not take my eyes off this film for fear of missing something .  it is the prefect fable/tale with morals ,  cute and scary sprites and 'monsters' but nevertheless heartwarming folk .  a child poked and bullied at school who becomes a hero .  picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a journey to the goblin mountain where he discovers the yokai ,  who are amazing creations that brian froud would be proud of .  and the evil kato and his off sider who definitely needed a hug .  these evil people capture the yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects ,  like motorbikes and other mechanical things and these meld into one horribly violent robotic monsters whose only job is to kill .  takashi a young boy is the one to become their saviour ,  alongside a red man/dragon a turtle man and a river princess as well as a cute little creature that ,  if it had been america they could have turned it into a cuddly toy and sold it at all good toy stores .  the lines are good especially the don't try this at home kids and other gems that bring a smile to your lips .  suspend belief and watch this with a child or on your own and enjoy !  though i must admit that the end was a wee bit sad .  and not necessarily so .  cheers furdion
stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history ,  and deservedly so ,  so i am happy to see any of their films .  professor noodle  ( lucien littlefield )  is nearing the completion of his rejuvenation formula ,  with the ability to reverse ageing ,  after twenty years .  ollie and stan are the chimney sweeps that arrive to do their job ,  and very quickly ollie wants to get away from stan making mistakes .  ollie goes to the roof to help with the other end of the brush at the top of the chimney ,  but stan in the living room ends up pushing the him back in the attic .  after breaking an extension ,  stan gets a replacement ,  a loaded gun ,  from off the wall ,  and of course it fires the brush off .  stan goes up to have a look ,  and ollie ,  standing on the attic door of the roof ,  falls into the greenhouse .  stan asks if he was hurt ,  and ollie only answers with  " i have nothing to say .  "  ollie gets back on the roof ,  and he and stan end up in a tug and pull squabble which ends up in ollie falling down and destroying the chimney .  ollie ,  hatless ,  in the fireplace is hit on the head by many bricks coming down ,  and the butler jessup  ( sam adams )  is covered in chimney ash smoke ,  oh ,  and ollie still has nothing to say to stan .  the boys decide to clean up the mess ,  and when stan tears the carpet with the shovel ,  ollie asks  " can't you do anything right "  ,  and stan replies  " i have nothing to say "  ,  getting the shovel bashed on his head .  as ollie holds a bag for stan to shovel in the ashes ,  they get distracted by a painting on the wall ,  and the ashes end up down ollie's trousers ,  so stan gets another shovel bashed on the head .  professor noodle finishes his formula ,  and does a final test on a duck ,  with a drop in a tank of water ,  changing it into a duckling .  he also shows the boys his success ,  turning the duckling into an egg ,  and he next proposes to use a human subject ,  i . e .  his butler .  while he's gone ,  the boys decide to test the formula for themselves ,  but ollie ends up being knocked by stan into the water tank with all the formula .  in the end ,  what was once ollie comes out ,  an ape ,  and when stan asks him to speak ,  all ollie ape says is  " i have nothing to say "  ,  and stan whimpers .  filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film ,  it is an enjoyable film .  stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians' comedian .  very good ! 
i have seen dirty work several times and is probably my favourite stan and ollie short .   in this one ,  stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of professor noodle  ( lucien littlefield )  .  while noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab ,  stan and ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room .  the end is where ollie falls into a tank of special formula that noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp !  the best part is where ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head ,  but he doesn't seem to suffer much pain from this .   dirty work is stan and ollie at their funniest .  great fun .   rating :  5 stars out of 5 . 
a laurel & hardy comedy short .  the boys arrive to sweep the chimneys at the home of professor noodle ,  a mad scientist who's just perfected his rejuvenation serum .  stan & ollie proceed with their dirty work ,  spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof .  then the professor wants to try out his new potion .  .  .   a very funny little film .  the ending is a bit abrupt ,  but much of the slapstick leading up to it is terrific .  especially good is stan & ollie's contest of wills at opposite ends of the chimney .  that's lucien littlefield as the professor . 
the concept of having laurel & hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious .  it guarantees some funny situations and silly antics ,  from especially stan laurel of course as usual .   the movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula .  it doesn't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending .  it's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless ,  so it works for the movie .   the supporting cast of the movie is surprising good .  sam adams is great as the stereotypical butler and lucien littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top as the nutty professor .   the movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences ,  which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed .  it all helps to make  " dirty work "  to be one of the better laurel & hardy shorts .   8/10
in many ways dirty work is a predictable l&h short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someone`s chimney  .  guess what happens next  ?  that`s right slapstick at its most sucessful ensues  .   but there`s one or two things that seem untypical  .  ollie for example is very unlikable  ,  he`s arrogant  ,  he`s rude  ,  and not only to stan look at the way he addresses the servant with  "  hey you  "  and takes a childish huff very easily with his catchphrase being  "  i have nothing to say  "   .  in short ollie plays a bully in a very unlikable way and i much prefer to see him to play the arrogant coward where he`s always at his funniest  dirty work also lacks the reportary regulars of the other l&h shorts like finlayson  ,  long  ,  busch and housman which means when we switch to the mad scientist plotline there`s a slightly creepy atmosphere that jars with the rest of the movie   having said that this is still a good short mainly down to stan  .  also watch out for a scene featuring a fish  .  many jokes/plots from l&h feature fish and this is another one
this is an unusual laurel & hardy comedy with something of a split personality :  at times it feels like two movies made in different styles spliced into a single short .  happily ,  each portion is funny in its own right ,  and the boys' seemingly effortless clowning carries the day and synthesizes the film's disparate elements into an entertaining whole .  while i've never heard a fan cite dirty work as his or her favorite laurel & hardy comedy ,  it's nonetheless one that everybody seems to like .   our story is set in the home of professor noodle ,  who represents one key element of the story-line :  a wildly over-the-top parody of mad scientist scenarios .  this marks a rare venture into sci-fi territory for l&h ;  abbott & costello and the three stooges tangled with mad doctors far more often than stan & ollie .  in any event ,  the professor is obsessed with creating a rejuvenating serum that can make people younger ,  while his sarcastic butler ,  jessup ,  expresses the viewer's skepticism with rolled eyes and the occasional dry quip .  meanwhile ,  stan & ollie are chimney sweeps who show up at the professor's home the very day he perfects his solution .   " their "  portion of the film consists of characteristic  ( but first-rate )  slapstick involving the chimney ,  the roof ,  shovels ,  and a number of unfortunate mishaps .  if you don't enjoy watching these guys screw up a task then you probably won't like dirty work ,  but for fans of the team this movie is a feast .  the highlight comes when ollie plummets through the chimney ,  lands in the fireplace ,  and is then pummeled with bricks that fall onto his head with maddening rhythmic precision ,  one by one .  i also like the shot of ollie tumbling off the roof into a greenhouse ;  the process work is so slapdash i suspect it was something of an inside joke ,  the way w . c .  fields' movies would feature the world's worst rear-projection screens .   the slapstick stuff is great fun ,  but it's the mad scientist motif that makes this film offbeat ,  and two supporting players deserve a tip of the bowler hat :  prolific character actor lucien littlefield is terrific as the professor ,  delivering his overripe lines with relish and cackling with hammy glee ,  while sam adams is a stitch in the less showy role of jessup the butler .  as great as stan laurel and oliver hardy were in their prime ,  it's always worth noting that their supporting casts at the hal roach studio gave their films an enormous boost .  so too ,  usually ,  did the background music of le roy shield ,  but dirty work marks a rare occasion from this period that a roach comedy has no musical accompaniment at all after the opening credits .  mood music might have enhanced the proceedings ,  but no matter ;  this is a highly enjoyable comedy anyhow ,  and a prime example of what made laurel & hardy so popular in their day . 
the romance of the movie ,  which is also its main theme ,  is good and nicely presented .  however ,  the surrounding of the love story is too lyric ,  graphical and unrealistic .  even worse ,  the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible ,  exactly like the end of the movie .  don't hesitate to watch this movie ,  if it attracted your interest ,  but don't expect too much of it either . 
a lonely depressed french boy mathieu  ( jeremie elkaim )  on vacation in the summer ,  meets and falls in love with cedric  ( the gorgeous stephane rideau )  .  quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie .  on one hand ,  i was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys .  on the other i was getting annoyed--the film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason .  it's very confusing and pointless .    spoilers ahead !  !  !   also there are tons of plot holes--mathieu ,  at one point ,  does something that ends him up in the hospital .  what is it--we're never told !  then he breaks up with cedric and tells everybody else he's living with him .  why ?  we're not told .  then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end .  why ?  no explanation .  it's clear cedric loves mathieu and mathieu is living in the same town so .  .  .  however it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much .  if only things were explained !   elkaim as mathieu is not good .  he's tall ,  handsome and has a nice body--but he can't act .  his idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his face--all the time .  rideau ,  on the other hand ,  is great .  he's very handsome ,  has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor .  also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him .  there is full frontal male nudity ,  lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is great--most movies shy away from showing male-male love scenes .  this one doesn't and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other .   so ,  a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeing--especially for rideau's nude scenes--that is ,  if you like good-looking nude young men !   
this movie has a special way of telling the story ,  at first i found it rather odd as it jumped through time and i had no idea whats happening .   anyway the story line was although simple ,  but still very real and touching .  you met someone the first time ,  you fell in love completely ,  but broke up at last and promoted a deadly agony .  who hasn't go through this ?  but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life .    i would say i am rather touched as two actor has shown great performance in showing the love between the characters .  i just wish that the story could be a happy ending . 
this movie was more of a passage into manhood for one gay man ,  and how he must deal with everyone .  his mother is depressed ,  his younger sister is a pain ,  his older sister is somewhat accepting .  the relationship looks good with his boyfriend/exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy .  unfortunately ,  the new guy screws around on him and says it really didn't mean anything .  our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves ,  dumping his new lover and starting over .  we are left with him starting over and viewing ,  not participating ,  in happiness .  so maybe things will go better for him in the future .  the ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so i will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating . 
takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film ,  because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love :  visitor q ,  gozu ,  izo ,  ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy .  lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he's succeeding .  still this was the first of his films i'd seen him take that direction ,  so i was nervous .  of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did .   great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too .  the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child :  neverending story ,  labyrinth ,  return to oz ,  etc .  i enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either .  the dark underlying morals are there ,  but ,  it's also as silly as any kids film should be .  i personally wasn't bothered by the cgi and prosthetics .  i feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice .   if you are a die hard takashi miike fan ,  you may not like this one .  but ,  i suggest giving it a shot .  it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is .  he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones ,  which is very reassuring .   to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one ,  i suggest these other miike films :  'zebraman' 'the happiness of the katakuris' 'sabu' and 'the bird people in china . '   good job takashi miike !  8/10 stars . 
a very close and sharp discription of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of specialy one 18year old guy ,  that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy ,  during an vacation with a part of his family .   i liked this film because of his extremly clear and surrogated storytelling  ,  with all this  " sound-close-ups "  and quiet moments wich had been full of intensive moods .   
most hollywood movies fail to capture the full range of experience of teenagers .  this film demonstrates exactly how to do it right .  it combines elements of humour ,  suffering ,  rebellion ,  etc .  in a way that is comlex & sympathetic .  the ending could be a bit clearer ,  but the fact that the director doesn't spell everything out for you in advance before coming to the conclusion means that this film assumes a more intelligent viewer . 
the plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much down-to-earth !  the romance between two teen-age boys on the screen was done in good taste .  you can easily relate to their emotions if you are one but if you are not one ,  you can appreciate the kind of love the film is trying to impart . 
the movie is very realistic .  absolutely ,  it does not belong to the hollywood cinema genre where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every move is precise .  the actors playing the roles of the lovers do a great job representing the characters' feelings and thoughts - their everyday life adventures .  overall ,  the movie climaxes the viewer to a depressed state .  this is where the realism of the whole story is apparent .  not everything happens the way we think it should happen .  i can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note .  we watch ,  we learn ,  we experience ourselves .  that is probably the moral of this story . 
this movie has everything .  emotion ,  power ,  affection ,  stephane rideau's adorable naked beach dance .  .  .  it exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship .  just because cedric and mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay doesn't mean there isn't quite useful insight for anybody in it .  i would probably classify it as a gay movie ,  but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people .  mathieu's incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society doesn't encourage us to act any differently ,  and that is what engenders the discord between him and cedric .  this is definitely a must-see !  !  !  ! 
i'm gonna give it to ya straight .  .  . this movie is amazing .  foreign gay films are so fast surpassing american gay films in production quality acting and story .  while so many american indie gay films are grainy ,  bad sound ,  amateur acting ,  trite story lines ,  and a surprising lack of any nudity or erotica ,  top-quality foreign gay films have been popping up like this one from france .  the cinematography is beautiful ,  thought out ,  meaningful .  the story is adult and complex  ( but not difficult for anyone to follow )  ,  the acting is intense and professional .  both leads are fantastic ,  as well as the entire cast .  the boys are more than just good-looking and there's plenty of full frontal nudity .  you follow the entire year of these boys ,  from their meeting to the end .  all the little nuances of a relationship's ,  the details of falling in ,  and out ,  of love are there beautifully performed .  it left me wanting more .  check it out ! 
'presque rien' is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the seaside .  i don't want to tell the plot ,  because it's not what's most important about this film  ( but you can be sure that it's interesting and original )  .  the best part of this movie is the cinematography .  the visual side of 'presque rien' is so amazing it deserves highest note .  it leaves you charmed with its beauty .   as for the plot ,  it is shown in uneven ,  rather complicated way .  there is no simple chronology nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings .  but this is what makes 'presque rien' even more interesting .  i recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed . 
there is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship--one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning .  and there is also emotion in the inner-workings of mathieu's family dealing w/ his mother's problems--and how that comes to bear on their relationship .  but the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered  ( unless i'm just too dumb to pick up on them )  .  why is mathieu in a mental hospital ?  what led to the boys' break-up ?  and the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first .  it seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills ,  or some male nudity .  but as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying . 
deeply emotional .  it can't leave you neutral .   yes it's a love story between 2 18 years old boys .  but it's only the body of this movie .  and it's been removed .  you only feel what happened with these boys .  you feel the soul of the movie .  with of course some action ,  some sex ,  but this is no pornography ,  too many feelings .   it was only a summer  " story "  ,  and it became ,  from love to hate ,  almost to death ,  the most important time of their lives .  i loved it ,  you will too ,  whatever your feelings are . 
i liked this film very much .  the story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow .  there is no resolution to the story whatsoever ,  and you are left to wonder what really happened .  since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this .  i especially like the  " dating "  scenes between the boys and i was drawn into their lives .  and of course any film with a naked staphane rideau will get a couple of extra points .   ; - ) 
 " yokai daisenso "  is a children's film by takashi miike ,  but as you might expect ,  it's probably a bit too dark & scary for younger ones .  however ,  older children may well eat this up ,  that is ,  if you play it dubbed in english .   the story is that of a young boy ,  who has moved with his mother to the country ,  to live with his grandfather ,  after a divorce .  during a village festival the boy is chosen as a  " kirin rider "  ,  a great honor ,  but with that honor comes much danger and adventure ,  of course .   meanwhile ,  evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt ,  go-go boots & a beehive hair-do ,  teams up with an evil yokai to turn people's resentments and discarded items against them .  and this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the city of rage itself ,  tokyo .  one quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city .  .  . says one ,   " oh ,  it's only gamera "  .    the young boy has befriended yokai ,  which are monsters of a kind ,  mostly benign ,  that have isolated themselves away from humans ,  and all the yokai in japan band together to fight the evil .   in many ways miike & crew have taken the late 60's/early 70's yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for  ( older )  kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of  " transformers "  .  the look and feel of the film is great ,  the effects are entertaining ,  and some of the humor will just sail right over kid's heads ,  but still ,  older ones might enjoy it .  as for adults ,  there's not much here not to like ,  if you're a fan of japanese monster movies you'll enjoy the heck out of this .   cool & fun stuff ,  kind of dark at times but perhaps that's just miike .  . and what a wild ride .  8 out of 10 . 
screened at the san francisco international film festival under the title ' come undone' ,  april 25 ,  26 ,  & 27 ,  2001 .  the cinematographer uses techniques that add to the storytelling .  even with fall/winter backgrounds for the 'present' and spring summer for the 'flashbacks' there can be some difficulty following the continuity .   whether either lead is gay ,  the actors well-portray the budding relationship in real life terms ;  from physical violence toward each other to their passionate lovemaking .  the story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly in the beginning .  but as the end approaches ,  you really care about where these guys will be next summer !  you ,  too ,  will want a sequel to find out . 
i found this film the first time when i was searching for some works in witch stéphane rideau had participate ,  still in an extraordinary ravishment caused by the astonishingly beautiful «les roseaux sauvages»  ( in portuguese ,  juncos silvestres )  ,  by andré téchiné .  i was searching for similar movies ,  in the come of age line .  i found then «presque rien» ,  a movie where the director sébastien lifshitz deliciously amazes us ,  earning a nomination by the cannes festival in 2000 .  the story is about two guys ,  the kind «boy next door» ,  mathieu  ( jérémie elkaïm )  and cédric  ( stéphane rideau )  ,  who meet during the summer vacations .  in a land far from where he lives ,  mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister .  there he meets cédric ,  a local ,  with whom he starts this estival and revealing relationship ,  much by means of the sensual and seducer personality that stéphane rideau gives his characters ,   ( in «les roseaux sauvages» ,  6 years younger ,  he still preserves the innocence of the sweet seducer ,  witch matures here in experience )  .  exemplar in directing ,  in the amorous sequence ,  in the intimate and confessing description that is made about a boys first facing his  ( still ambiguous )  sexuality and great love .  the first love ,  in its terrible progression ecstasy-despair .  the best of the film is the best of france :  the fervent passion ,  the hot and excited rationalism ,  the brownish beauty ,  the simple and natural acceptance made by the families ,  although not without surprise and first anger .  still ,  there is the beach ,  the luminosity ,  the lightness e simplicity of summer ,  the freshness of breeze ,  the surge&#8217 ; s melody ,  and the expressive eyes of an introverted elkaïm  ( hesitant ,  hurt ,  puzzled ,  passionate )  .  the sex is not avoided nor exploited ,  it is treated as it is ,  with no exhibitionist intention .  in virtue of pure talent ,  this is a work of drama of uncommon quality ,  without cheap sentimentalism ,  showing an inevitably real image of two homosexual in their prime youth as any ordinary person ,  although with a social fear of rejection and shame .  it is well worthy being seen ,  especially by those who adore french movies  ( although the dvd front cover is very lame ,  with the two actors in between tens of stars ,  greased with brilliantine )  .  a movie witch ,  in my opinion ,  deserves an 8-9 ! 
yokai monsters :  spook warfare  ( yokai daisenso ,  2005 )  a movie about  " yokai "  or traditional japanese  " monsters "  of folklore .  it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghosts on parade .   the yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak ,  kappa water imp ,  a living 'brella ,  a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic ,  a woman with a second face on the back of her head ,  a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd-like wrist ,  & so on .   these sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore ,  but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era ,  comparable to today's halloween haunted houses ,  or the  " freak shows "  of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks .  ghosts & goldfish monsters & dancing one-headed umbrellas were trumped up to create  " chills "  during the hot summers .  the fatcheek woman & such were recreated by tricks or illusions ,  based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls ;  & if their design for the movie is a bit simple & hoky ,  this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills .   these rather endearing monsters have to face off & destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon who has come to japan & disguised himself as a samurai lord .  despite that some of the japanese apparitions are a bit goofy ,  & too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak ,  it is all played very poker-faced & is very charming .  it has some beautiful cinematography ,  much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade .  viewed in the right mood or with the right friends ,  it is exciting ,  moving & touching .   yoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf & cub :  white heaven & hell  ( 1974 )  &and was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy .  the yokai monsters series is not the equal of majin at its best ,  but the yokai are nevertheless great fun .  the first miike movie which is the most child-oriented of his family films ,  with the gozu & izoo consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers . 
what seemed at first just another introverted french flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me ,  on second viewing ,  a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation .   spoiler of sorts follows .   poor cedric ;  he apparently didn't know what hit him .  poor audience ;  we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch .  these two guys just didn't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter .  as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other ,  the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu ,  an intellectual being ,  to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach .   on a purely technical note ,  i loved the camera action in this film .  subtitles were totally unnecessary ,  even though my french is  " presque rien .  "  i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more .  this was a polished ,  very professionally made motion picture .  though many scenes seem superfluous ,  i rate it nine out of ten . 
i agree that the movie is a little slow at spots having many scenes of mundane everyday life and no dialog .  and i wasn't impressed right after i watched it .  however ,  after a few days ,  i realized that the movie stays with me and it evokes a melancholy mood which lingers in my mind .  my appreciation of this movie increases .  it certainly merits a higher consideration than those movies that are instantly forgettable .   as many have commented ,  the movie is non-linear and that's a hallmark of european film-making as opposed to the linear narrative form that hollywood favors .  i don't really know whether it's true or not .  many also dislike its confusing structure and lack of clear explanations .  to those viewers ,  i don't think there is much i can say to change their opinions .  however ,  for others who have yet to see the film ,  do expect to be challenged and don't expect the film to supply all the answers and you might come away enjoying it more than you would otherwise .   the movie skips around a bit but really chronicles just 3 time periods .  pay attention to the hair style and you can easily separate out 2 of the 3 periods .  it is also not as confusing as suggested ;  just enjoy and it'll all be clear at the end .   yes ,  lots of things are left unsaid or not shown ,  and lots of situations are left unexplored .  but isn't that what life is like ?  a lot of time you're not sure of the motives of your friends/loved ones unless you confront them and even then ,  you can never be 100% sure if they told you the whole truth .  this type of movies forces us to interpret the reasons behind the actions .  the movie does ,  however ,  leave enough hints for you to make some reasonable assumptions .  for example ,  mathieu is manic depressive ,  to the point of suicidal .  why ?  i don't know ,  maybe his life is not turning out exactly as he expects it ;  maybe he misses his family but hasn't forgiven his father for abandoning his sick mother at her hours of need ;  maybe after all he sacrifices for cedric ,  rearranging and indeed ,  shattering his life to be with him ,  he realizes that it is all  " coming undone "  .  i think the director meant to show us that he has always been a little off ,  mentality fragile by that scene w/ the dead bird .  maybe he has a very sensitive psyche and all these stresses are taking a toll on him .  but we're also shown that he is not some animal torturing psycho by his loving interaction w/ the stray cat .  also ,  there is one conversation between the doctor and cedric that sheds light on the reason behind the breakup and maybe the suicide attempt .  the doctor asks him if everything is okay ,  and cedric thinks so even though he cheated on mathieu once ,  but that's nothing ,  according to cedric .  is that the only reason ,  we don't know ,  there are probably others ,  all mixed up together .  is it paramount that we know exactly what they are ?  i don't think so ,  for this movie .  another telltale sign that they are ultimately not compatible is the historical ruins scene .  mathieu is interested in studying the ruins ,  cedric is not .  he is the one w/ the raging hormone who focuses only on the physical side without an intellectual side that mathieu obviously needs .   finally ,  the ending is really rather hopeful and sweet .  i was pleasantly surprised by the turn of events after the bleak tone that edges toward the end .   i have two complaints for the dvd .  one is the sound .  it's very soft .  i had to crank up the volume to hear the dialog and then when it switched to a bar or outdoor crowd scene ,  it became too loud .  the other is that the subtitles can't be turn off ;  they stay on the screen .  most foreign movie dvds not released by a major studio are shoddy this way unfortunately . 
first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema  :  the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or ,  worse ,  slightly ridiculous .   lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving ,  sexy ,  thoroughly engrossing tale of love ,  disaster and possible redemption ,  while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence .   the core story is of mathieu ,  18 ,  a solitary ,  introverted boy who meets cédric ,  brasher ,  more outgoing but just as lonely ,  while on holiday with his family .  as the summer warms on ,  they fall in love and ,  when the holidays end ,  decide to live together .  a year later ,  the relationship ends in catastrophe :  cédric cheats on mathieu who ,  distraught ,  tries to take his own life .  he survives and ,  in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met ,  this time cloaked in the chill of winter .   if the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does :  much of it is implied ,  all of it happens non-sequentially .   the intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced ,  through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective .  fortunately ,  the three time-lines used  ( the summer of love ,  the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction )  are colour coded :  warm yellows and oranges for the summer ,  an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside .   both main actors put in excellent performances though ,  whilst it's a delight to see stéphane rideau  ( cédric )  used to his full capacity  ( i'm more used to seeing him under-stretched in gael morel's rather limp dramas )  ,  jérémie elkaim  ( mathieu )  has to be singled out for special mention :  you can feel his loneliness ,  then his almost incredulous passion ,  then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia .  beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could .   the themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema :  our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling ;  our difficulty in communicating fully ;  the shifting sands of meaning the film's title  " presque rien "   ( almost nothing )  points to all of these and ,  indeed ,  to one of the key scenes in the film :  in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself ,  a psychiatrist asks cédric if he had ever cheated on him  " non enfin ,  oui une fois ,  mais ce n'était rien "   ( no well ,  yes once ,  but it was nothing )  .  cédric still loves mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt  ( none of which we see )  and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but cannot understand that he has lost him forever ,  because something that seemed nothing to him  ( a meaningless affair )  is everything to mathieu .   whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate pierre et gilles poster would suggest ,  it is not without hope :  we get to see cédric's slow ,  painful attempts to get back in touch with life ,  first through a cat he adopts ,  then through work in a local bar and finally contact with pierre ,  who may be his next love .  but here the story ends :  a teenage passion ,  over within the year ,  another perhaps beginning .  so what was it ?  almost nothing ?  certainly not when you're living it
stephane rideau was already a star for his tour de force in  " wild reeds ,  "  and he is one of france's biggest indie stars .  in this film ,  he plays cedric ,  a local boy who meets vacationing mathieu  ( newcomer jamie elkaim ,  in a stunning ,  nuanced ,  ethereal performance )  at the beach .  mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother ,  demanding aunt and sister  ( with whom he has a competitive relationship )  .  soon ,  the two are falling in love .   the film's fractured narrative -- which is comprised of lengthy flash-backs ,  bits and pieces of the present ,  and real-time forward-movement into the future -- is a little daunting .  director sebastien lifshitz doesn't signal which time-period we are in ,  and the story line can be difficult to follow .  but stick it out :  the film's final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen .  by turns heart-breaking and uplifting ,  this film ranks with  " beautiful thing "  as must-see cinema . 
maybe  " presque rien "  is not the best movie ever made .  .  .  but it is better than many of you have said .  i still haven't seen a homo-themed movie better than this one .   you americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies ,  with a clear beginning ,  development and outcome .  but european movies are less narrative ,  but makes you think much and feel .   many of you didn't understand the sense of the movie .  .  the purpose of this one is not show us a simple  " summer loving movie "  ,  with commercial characters who  " fall in love and live happy forever "  .  summer holidays and beach are only a background ,  and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys .   maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie ,  because of its 3 parts ,  showed as flashbacks .  these 3 moments are :  - summertime in pornichet ,  when they meet and love .  - after a year and half living together in nantes ,  mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself .  he tries to suicide taking something ,  and cedric brings him to hospital .  later ,  he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that .  - the last part ,  is when mathieu come back to pornichet ,  in winter ,  alone .  .  to think about how his life have changed ,  how his life become to be ,  and trying to find himself .   it's possible that some people couldn't understand all this well ,  because all the scenes are mixed among them .  but anyway ,  as i said before .  .  .  this is not a funny movie .  if what someone want to see is meat ,  for that ,  we have belami movies .   presque rien ,  what want to show us ,  is how cruel can be the life ,  for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life .  mathieu only wants to go away from home ,  and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness .  .  but what seemed perfect at the beginning .  .  later is not as good as he thought ,  and he become troubled ,  and feel that he has lost the way of his life .  he is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do ,  or what makes him happy .  he finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide .    so ,  funny ?  is not a funny movie .  very hot scenes ?  only a few .  .  but this is not a movie for entertainment .  is all about feelings .  .  .  friendship ,  love ,  happiness ,  unhappiness ,  pain ,  depression ,  loneliness .  .  .  i ,  as many others ,  feel identified with life and problems of mathieu ,  and that is what director wanted to do .  .  a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy's life .   for me ,  the best homo-themed movie ever . 
an adult ,  realistic ,  cruel ,  dark story ,  like a second part of  " les roseaux savages "   ( the wild reeds )  ,  plenty of beauty and sadness ,  ellipsis and silences ,  shadows and little sparks of hope .  a man searching for a warm companion ,  a better life ,  a sincere attitude . 
'presque rien'  ( 'come undone' )  is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director sébastien lifshitz  ( with the collaboration of writer stéphane bouquet - the team that gave us the later 'wild side' )  .  as we come to understand lifshitz's manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable .  by allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now ,  time passed ,  time reflective ,  time imagined ,  time alone - lifshitz makes his tales more personal ,  involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters' responses .  it takes a bit of work to key into his method ,  but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film .   mathieu  ( handsome and gifted jérémie elkaïm )  is visiting the seaside for a holiday ,  a time to allow his mother  ( dominique reymond )  to struggle with her undefined illness ,  cared for by the worldly and wise annick  ( marie matheron )  and accompanied by his sister sarah  ( laetitia legrix )  :  their distant father has remained at home for business reasons .  weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of mathieu alone ,  looking depressed ,  riding trains ,  speaking to someone in a little recorder .  we are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action .   while sunning at the beach mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him ,  and we can feel mathieu's emotions quivering with confusion .  the youth cédric  ( stéphane rideau )  follows mathieu and his sister home ,  continuing the mystery of attraction .  soon cédric approaches mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession .  mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking ,  rebuffs cédric's public approaches ,  but continues to seek him out for consignations .  the two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship ,  so very necessary to understanding this story ,  is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes .  yet as the summer wears on mathieu ,  a committed student ,  realizes that cédric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival .  it becomes apparent that cédric is the dionysian partner while mathieu is the apollonian one :  in a telling time in architectural ruin mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while cédric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking .   mathieu is a complex person ,  coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non-present father ,  a fear of his burgeoning sexuality ,  and his nascent passion for cédric .  their moments of joy are disrupted by cédric's admission of infidelity and mathieu's inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways .  time passes ,  family changes are made ,  and mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt .  the manner in which mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace ,  strangely enough ,  in one of cédric's past lovers pierre  ( nils ohlund )  brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax .   after viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful .  lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion ,  conflicts with passion's powers found in love ,  and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful .  the entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative .  lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film-making .  in french with english subtitles .  highly recommended .  grady harp
 " come undone "  appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum .  granted ,  it's a film that promises a take on gay life ,  as most viewers expect and somehow ,  it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young man's soul .  the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended .  it is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that ,  in the end ,  will leave mathieu confused ,  hurt and depressed when things don't go according to what he hoped the relationship would be .   if you haven't seen the film ,  perhaps you would like to stop reading .   sebastien lifshitz ,  the director of the film ,  has told his story from mathieu's viewpoint .  most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film ,  but there are hints that are not obvious ,  as one can see ,  in retrospect .  the story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film .  this is a story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life together .   first of all ,  cedric ,  the handsome young local ,  pursues mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him .  mathieu feels the attraction for cedric too .  we realize how different both young men are by the way cedric tells mathieu's family how he feels school is not for him .  on the other hand ,  mathieu ,  who wants to be an architect ,  finds beauty in the abandoned place where cedric has taken him .  we watch as mathieu ,  reading from the guide book ,  wants cedric's attention .   when mathieu comes out to his mother ,  she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career .  she also points out about what future both of them would have together ,  which proves to be true .  mathieu appears to have learned his lesson ,  the hard way .  he goes on to an uncertain life with cedric and attempts to take his own life .  we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soul .   the ending might be confusing for most viewers ,  but there is a moment in the film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to pierre ,  the young man who frequents the bar .  that is why when mathieu goes looking for pierre at his house ,  appears to be hard to imagine .  yet ,  we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre .  the last scene at the beach ,  when pierre and mathieu are seen strolling in the sand ,  has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy ,  apparently lost ,  but then realizing the father is nearby .   jeremie elkaim makes mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films .  this is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level .  mathieu has suffered a lot ,  first with the separation of his parents ,  then with his depressed mother and with losing cedric .  stephan rideau ,  who has been seen on other important french films ,  is equally good ,  as the shallow cedric .   while  " come undone "  will divide opinions ,  the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care sebastien lifshitz gives to the story . 
'presque rien' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual .  eschewing both stereotypes and preaching ,  it's a wonderfully naturalistic film ,  superbly acted ,  shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place ,  never melodramatic but often painfully real .  if anything it's almost too realistic ,  as there's little in the way of conventional plot ,  just scenes from a life .  but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn .  'presque rien' might not be the most exciting film ever made ;  but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the pre-conceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme .  worth a watch . 
only after some contemplation did i decide i liked this movie .  and after reading comments from all the other posters here ,  and thinking about it some more ,  i decided that i liked it tremendously .  i love american films - probably because they are so narrative .  they usually have a well-defined beginning ,  middle ,  and end .   " presque rien ,  "  on the other hand ,  makes no such attempt .  i disagree with other posters that say it's 'too artsy . ' in every way ,  this film is meant to evoke your sense memories .  so often throughout the film you feel like you're there .  .  .  you feel the summer sun ,  the breezes ,  the heat ,  the winter chill ,  the companionship ,  the loneliness ,  etc .  ,  etc .   in every way ,  the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them .  after i finished watching it ,  i felt the same .  but upon some reflection ,  i recognized that this is how the movie had to be :  the 'story' isn't the narrative ,  it's the emotions you  ( the viewer )  feel .   the lighting ,  scenery ,  and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - they're rich ,  exquisite ,  and alive with detail and nuance .  although i normally cannot countenance films without a fully developed plot  ( after all ,  isn't a movie 'supposed' to tell a story )  ,  this film is definitely one of my new favorites . 
after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy ,  bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler :  diva las vegas ,  a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas .  midler ,  who has been performing live on stage since the 1970's ,  proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business .  from her opening number ,  her classic  " friends "  ,  where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud ,  bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap-styled number called  " i look good "  she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections .  the section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage  ( even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it ,  but her ad-libbing until she remembers it is hysterical )  .  bette also treats us to  " rose's turn "  from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club .  she brings the house down near the end with  " stay with me ,  baby "  from the rose and her only #1 hit record ,   " wind beneath my wings "  from beaches .  it's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans ,  it's a must . 
a longtime fan of bette midler ,  i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites .  bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads .  a literal rainbow of emotion and talent ,  bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire ,  as well as new songs from the  " bette of roses "  album .  spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone .  the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around . 
love it ,  love it ,  love it !  this is another absolutely superb performance from the divine miss m .  from the beginning to the end ,  this is one big treat !  don't rent it- buy it now ! 
bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in  " diva las vegas "  .  i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to .  she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity .  her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you .  the highlight of the show was her singing  " stay with me "  from her 1979 movie  " the rose "  .  you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps .  the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette midler's albums . 
bette midler is indescribable in this concert .  she gives her all every time she is on stage .  whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads ,  bette midler moves her audience .  if you can't see it live  ( which is the best way to see bette )  then this is the next best thing .  an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power .  her more  " vocally correct "  version of  " stay with me "  never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness ,  here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever .  i will treasure this concert for a very long time . 
bette midler is again divine !  raunchily humorous .  in love with burlesque .  capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power & punch than ever .  all in all singing new ballads ,  power-singing the good old/perennial ones such as  " the rose "  ;   " stay with me "  and yes ,  even  " wind beneath my wings "  .  the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe - since this is the next best thing to it ,  i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries ! 
story of ireland in the 70/s .  this film is a beautiful reconstruction of small time ireland in the 1970/s .  all the gang are there see below .  master boyle  ,  the boys  ,  the cannon  ,  sp o'donnell  ,  senator doogan's daugter  ,  rose  ,  agnes  ,  maura and una .  see this film . feel ireland as it was .   
2005 toronto film festival report it is official ;   " takashi miike "  is whacked .   the annual midnight screening of the new  " takashi miike "  film ,   " the big spook war "  or  " the great yokai war "  or  " yôkai daisensô "  .  call it what you will this is a fanatical ride .   colin geddes ,  the fearless programmer stated this film was originally geared towards children in japan .  think of  " lord of the rings "  or  " neverending story "  for japan .  after the screening i can understand where they were going with that ,  but damn this is  " takashi miike "  after all .  he directed the '01 film  " ichi the killer "  ,  when it screening at the festival barf bags were handed out at the screening .  and no ,  that wasn't just a marketing ploy .   plot summary :  a young boy with a troubled home life becomes  " chosen ,  "  and he stumbles into the middle of a great spirit war ,  where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journey .   this is not really for kids ,  well not 'too' young .  certainly see them getting scared shitless with some of these spirits  ( even the friendly ones )  on display .  this is unlike anything i've seen in the movie theater before .  a fantasy naturally ,  some very funny  ( but dark )  material .  you will not be bored can guarantee that .  will this ever hit north america ?  doubtful .   my rating = b
this is a small film  ,  few characters  , theatrical . and yet it says something about ireland that you won't find elsewhere . this film is ireland .  in all it's grubiness ,  it's sadness , it's self-delusion . the boys  ,  master doyle  ,  sp o'donell ,  the cannon  ,  senator doogan's daughter  ,  gar and above all madge . i know them . i'm in the pub with them or kneeling to pray with them .  they are our sad history and they are our present . 
after reading the original play i thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be .  donal mccann puts in a once-off great performance as public gar ,  the repressed antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted  ( but unseen to others )  alterego- private gar .  eamonn kelly also plays an excellent  " screwballs "  whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by gar .   definitely worth renting out if you can find it .   ( probably unavailable outside ireland & uk ) 
one of the best movies i ever saw was an irish movie titled philadelphia , here i come .  i read the play before i saw the movie and loved them both .  it's the story of a young man preparing to leave ireland to go to america because he can't earn a living in ireland .  it is told both from the perspective of the young man ( whom the other characters in the film can see )  and another young man representing his uncensored thoughts and feelings .  ,  but who cannot be seen by the other characters in the film .  it is a very sad movie ,  but deeply touching ,  and i would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to think about .  i love any irish movie ,  or almost any movie about ireland ,  and any film that has the late irish actor donal mccann in it gets my vote . i would watch that man chew gum for 2 hours on screen ,  and unfortunately , i have . terrible shame to have lost him so young . 
paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her youth was like growing up .   tony shaloub executes a flawless performance as an russian scientist  ( phd )  who cannot find decent work in america .  he befriends an isolated parrot while performing meanial duties of a janitor at a behavioral science lab .   the chief doctor is a bitter man ,  as paulie ,  who can speak and fully comprehend language and learn ,  embarasses the doctor ,  who later banishses him to the lower levels of the building ,  where mikail  ( tony s .  )  finds him .   paulie recants his life with marie and how they lost each other .  the quest begins to reunite paulie with marie ,  only more than 20 years has passed .   the movie ends ,  some will say predictably ,  with mikail reuniting paulie with marie .  the story closes with the three entering marie's home ,  where you can make the final your own choice .   great family film ! 
i know ,  i know :  it's childish .  but i just love this type of movie .  a bird that suffered a lot of  " mishaps "  and still hasn't lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor .  what's special about this film is the fact that the main character is paulie -the parrot- and he's not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor .  furthermore i like the storyline :  paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom .   ( by the way :  jay mohr's voice almost sounds like joe pesci's !  )  .  and cheech marin of course ,  the man is humor to me .  ever since i saw  " up in smoke "  i have appreciated his naive way of performing ,  making a simple situation a hilarious one .  .  can't help myself . 
paulie sounds like the most saccharine ,  lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find ,  yet it's actually much better than you might expect .  the daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film ,  but actually in most other departments the film is charming .   in case you're wondering ,  paulie is a parrot .  bought for a little girl with speech difficulties ,  paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her .  he even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons ,  and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker himself .  however ,  paulie is sent away by the little girl's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from n . y . c to l . a to be re-united with her .   so ,  why does this awful-sounding film succeed relatively well ?  firstly ,  it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects .  secondly  ( and far more significantly )  it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving ,  often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline .  thirdly ,  it has several surprisingly strong performances ,  including jay mohr as a wily crook ,  gena rowlands as a kind old lady ,  and cheech marin  ( yes ,  the dope-smoking cheech marin !  )  as a musical immigrant .  it might not be a classic ,  but paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages . 
i didn't give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like  " citizen kane "  and  " seven samaurai .  "  however ,  this movie is so all-around wonderful ,  it's a real shame it scores so poorly for the general imdb voter .  however ,  the imdb voter leans to the geeky ,  and  " paulie "  doesn't qualify for that .   the only acting criticism i might suggest is that hallie kate eisenberg didn't portray the perfect stuttering child .  i'm sorry ,  but asking a 6 year-old child to out-do dustin hoffman as the rainman is asking for the impossible in film-making .   moving past that minor complaint ,  the movie has the best of many films :  buddy road-trip ,  con-games ,  hero as friendly party-animal  ( party-bird ?  )  ,  disney-like humor for young and old ,  etc .  what's not to like ?  tony shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans .  that's normal for him ,  it seems .   (  " i'm russian .  .  .  i like long stories .  )  i don't like mangoes ,  but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one .  watch the movie and that will make sense .   buddy hackett and cheech marin make very appropriate appearances in the film .  roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them .  i have always found jay mohr to be a bit slimy ,  and his on-screen role fits that as well .  the only surprise to me was finding that jay was also paulie's voice .  in the end ,  even that works well ;  put parrot and anti-parrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its own .   if you are trying to find a film for you and the kids that is neither insulting nor boring for either ,   " paulie "  is a perfect candidate .  i will ,  however ,  admit that a happy moment colors my review of  " paulie .  "  i was on a road-trip during a major heat-wave .  the car's air-conditioning died ,  half the restaurants had dead cooling  ( as did our hotel )  and i said ,   " let's watch a movie where there is working air-conditioning .  "  so we did .  so for 100 minutes we were cooled ,  amused ,  and given a heart-warming experience .  when i saw it recently on vcr under less emotional circumstances ,  i realized just how well this movie was made .   it's a sleeper film you won't regret watching . 
most folks might say that if one were to spend a saturday night watching a movie , you must be really bored .  actually , i had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the tv and there it was ,  " paulie "  .    i had missed the opening credits , so i didn't know the name of it but i saw that it had cheech marin in it , so i naturally thought i had tuned into  " born in east l . a .  "  when i saw him talking to a talking parrot , i was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night .   happy to say , it was better than that .  as you know , if you don't already paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner .  seems it's taken years to find her .  what should be paulie's advantage is actually a dis-advantage in ways .  people come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves .    while cheech marin's character  " is "  making money from him , he's not mean to him .  the dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute , i found them amusing .   paulie , who's naive' , learns quickly that not all humans are nice people .  especially the owner of an animal research lab .  the man lies to him saying he'll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research .  paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of paulie's vocal ability .   throughout the film paulie's telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him , several other animals and finding the location of paulie's owner .  it's a touching reunion .    8 out of 10 , the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown .  that part might bother younger children .  otherwise , it's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart .   ( end ) 
the movie was very sweet and heartwarming !  i cry almost every time i watch the movie .  i would recommend this movie for every one .  the movie was so inspiring to me .  the actors did a great job of acting ,  and the movie was very well played and done .  the movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named paulie .  paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her .   after paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement .  finally this russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor .  had found paulie in the basement and paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life .  in the end the man helped paulie reunite with marie  ( the little girl who raised paulie )  .  love overcame all the obstacles . 
this movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids .  the movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level .  i watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny ,  entertaining , and heartwarming and did not see it again for several years .  i watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining .  this movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life .  this movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right .  i recommend this movie to anyone of any age . 
what a strangely wonderful ,  if sometimes slight and bulky ,  big-budget fantasy this is .  takashi miike had already proved ,  by the time he got to the great yokhai war ,  that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime/yakuza genre  ( visitor q and andromedia showed this ,  the former great the latter lesser )  .  but here miike ,  in his first and only co-screen writing credit no less ,  proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions ,  and with it boatload of cgi ,  creature-effects and make-up ,  and an epic battle that is more like a  " festival "  than something out of lord of the rings .  the comparisons can be made far and wide ,  to be sure ,  and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki ,  for the seemingly unique mixture of kids-as-big-heroes ,  power-hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source ,  machinery as the greatest evil ,  and many bizarrely defined ,  flamboyantly designed creatures  ( or yokai of the title )  .  but there can also be comparisons made to star wars ,  especially to the gungan battle in tpm ,  and to the whole power-play between good and evil with similar forces .  or to anime like samurai 7 .  or ,  of course ,  to henson's films .  and through all of these comparisons ,  and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments ,  it's miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters .    here ,  ryunosuke kamiki plays tadashi ,  the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world ,  but will become the hero in a world going into darkness .  the darkness is from an evil sorcerer ,  who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world ,  and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures ,  the yokhai ,  into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission- to destroy and kill anything in their paths .  tadashi gets as pumped up to fight sato the sorcerer as the yokai once sato's main minion and cohort ,  agi  ( kill bill's chiaki kuriyama ,  another great villainies )  steals tadashi's little furry companion ,  a sunekosuri .  soon ,  things come to a head ,  in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories ,  but can only be contained ,  up to a point ,  by miike and his crew .  i would probably recommend the great yokai war for kids ,  but in the forward note that it's not some watered down fantasy in american circles .  this has creatures galore ,  including a one-eyed umbrella stand ,  and a walking ,  talking wall ,  not to mention a turtle ,  a fire serpent ,  and a woman who became cursed by sato .  so the variety is on high on that end ,  and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects- which grows to unfathomable heights when the  " festival "  hits with the yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope .  but there's also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark ,  and sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at miike's disposal  ( and not just because it's cuteness squared )  ;  where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury ,  who ends up in a tragic battle with tadashi in robot form ?    yet through all of this ,  the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of miike's career is here as well ,  which distinguishes it from its animated ,  muppet and sci-fi counterparts .  there's the bizarre humor as usual ,  including a song dedicated to akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax ,  and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes  ( i loved ,  for example ,  the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller ,  or the anxious turtle-yokai )  .  the biggest danger with miike's access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry ,  which he flirts with ,  is overkill on this end .  he's got everything down ,  i'm sure ,  with storyboards ,  and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions  ( one of them is when all is said and done ,  and tadashi and the 'other' human character are in the middle of the tokyo rubble in an overhead shot )  ,  but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots ,  and the interplay skirts on being too flamboyant ,  and some visuals ,  like the overlay of the yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map ,  just seem weak and pat .  i almost wondered if miike might dip into  ( bad )  spy kids territory ,  quite frankly .   but this liability aside ,  the great yokai war provides more than a share of excitement ,  goofy thrills ,  and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies .  it owes a lot to cinema ,  as well as traditional japanese folklore ,  but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats .  it's not the filmmaker at his very best ,  but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage .  it's got a neat little message ,  and lots of cool adventure .  7 . 5/10
made me wish my own happy birds could talk .  tisk tisk on the reviewer who dissed the movie .  a sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy .  paulie is a lovable little treasure .  he has quite a few clever lines that truly made me laugh .  i especially loved the dance sequences during his showbiz stint .  you can forgive the obvious clichés as you cheer him on in his quest to be reunited with marie .  a charming movie featuring two strong characters who genuinely befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner .  would have liked to have seen more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey .  i liked her artistic and poetic inspirations ,  a shame she could not share paulie's reunion .  bless paulie in his new home ,  at last with marie ,  perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey . 
i have to tell you ,  this is a great movie .  it surprises me sometimes how good a movie with no pretenses can be .  this one is just fabulous .  it could be that it isn't trying too hard to send any kind of message ;  it just tells a whimsical ,  fun story .  i gave it a 10 out of 10 . 
this is such a great movie to watch with young children .  i'm always looking for an excuse to watch it over & over .  gena was good ,  cheech was fun , the russian was good ,  maria was adorable & of course paulie was the best ! 
a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a  " children's film "  ,  and that it certainly is ,  though it is one made for adults .  takashi miike uses the fantasy genre ,  particularly ,  the children's fantasy genre ,  as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai war .   the setup is simple a boy is selected to play the  " hero "  in this years annual festival ,  only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined .  what follows is a hallucinatory ,  grotesque ,  whimsical ,  and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore ,  but wait there's also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world .  however ,  the villain here ,  is not a mere demon ,  it is the demon-spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans  " use "  and  " discard "  .  usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate/resentment ,  the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals ( those whove played the video game ,  sonic the hedghog ,  might remember a certain dr .  robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly's who sonic had to then  " liberate "  )  .   the hero in this film is actually the least interesting character ,  essentially playing the straight man ,  in a world gone suddenly mad .  though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers ,  as do many of the yokia themselves ,  who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots ,  some spirits being umbrellas with eyes ,  talking walls ,  or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans .  .  . of course in this magical world of miike's yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them .   in several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children's fantasy ,  as few ,  if any ,  of the characters are heroic ,  their victory being a combination of happenstance ,  almost arbitrary faith ,  and a desire to party .  the yokai spirits ,  only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout ,  after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival ,  and even then only to dance and party .  also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all's well that ends well fantasy ending ,  but with a final scene ,  showing our hero years older ,  with an adult job ,  now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth ,  who then despondently turn to the villain ,  who being a spirit can never really die .  this ending ,  with it's yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemon's pikachu ,  warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves ,  but of the horrors of over-consumption .  the villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them ( in japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit )  ,  and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence ,  they become soulless vengeful machines ,  not unlike those seen in modern video games ,  suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die ,  but can become deformed .   this is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to ,  and i believe it shows ,  as there's a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness .  though i've focused mostly on the story  ( since lots of users here seem to write it off )  ,  i do want to say that visually it's a kaleidescope of cgi ,  stop animation ,  costume ,  and live puppetry ,  that works remarkably well .  there's a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film ,  and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted ,  as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons ,  though this film is sharper and more adult than either .  the yokai are beaten ,  brutalized ,  and turned into machines of living hate ,  who i believe even kill a few humans ,  a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening ,  while a sexual undercurrent ,  the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero ,  or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy ,  seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes ,  especially when considering this is a  " children's film "  .  however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough ,  not to traumatize any children to bad .  grims fairy tales ,  before revisions ,  did much worse ,  far more often .   all and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet ,  with enough visual drama and great performances ( the yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them ,  thats laugh out loud funny at times )  to appeal to audiences of all ages ,  and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth .  the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them ,  but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood .  another beautiful ,  funny ,  and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn't come close to his apex .  instant classic .

spoiler this is a great film about a conure .  he goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner .  he learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds .  if you love birds like my wife does ,  this film is for you .  this film also has some sad parts that make the tears run .  in the end it all works out for paulie and his russian friend .  rent this for the whole family ,  everyone will enjoy this . 
this movie brought tears to my eyes ;  john roberts really knew how to get to viewers' hearts ,  directing this wonderful picture where life is viewed through the mind and heart of paulie .  we discover from time to time ,  with the help of sensitive and talented directors like john ,  that even small creatures like paulie have a heart .  i just couldn't stop my tears ,  even though the film has a happy end .  this is great ,  after thousands of films i saw through my life ,   " paulie "  really touched me deeply .  this is ,  after the  " ugly duckling "  ,  the second picture that really turned me upside down . 
a very refreshing story ,  the life of a parrot with an intellect higher than an average human's .  shows humans from a bird's point of view .  especially liked the portrayal of different types of characters that the bird spends time with .  not all birds are bird-brained .  .  . 
a sentimental story with a sentimental sound track .  it's about a little girl  (  with a voice impediment  )  who treasures her green parrot paulie .  the parrot thinks and talks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion .   the parrot is definitely the star of the film .  at times mischievous and at times in fits of depression the bird captures the mood in a most remarkable and expressive way .  the synchronised voice too is very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists .   early in the film her father gives the bird to a pawnbroker and the subsequent scenes tell the story of paulie's constant struggle over many years to be re-united with his mistress .  one of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people using the automatic teller machines .  paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory .   the ending is predictable ,  but who would want it otherwise .  children will love this film and anybody who keeps a bird as a pet will delight in paulie's antics . 
a talking parrot isn't a hugely imaginative idea for a new film ,  but paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant ,  heartwarming film that will delight the whole family .  it manages to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel harshness during marie and paulie's separation ,  and all the events in the film lead to a hugely satisfying emotional conclusion .  the animal training is well-done - everyone will be affected when paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time .  paulie is a great character and should have received way more success ,  though this film wasn't a highlight of 1998 ,  unlike saving private ryan .  this hour and a half will surely be an enjoyable one and one that you will remember .  paulie's story is a moving ,  sad ,  happy and interesting one - from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner ,  you will enjoy following him and watching him learning about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way .  not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion .  9/10
i approach films about talking animals with care .  for every wonderful one like babe ,  you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of homeward bound :  the incredible journey .  or in the case of cats & dogs ,  you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential .  when i heard about paulie ,  the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence .  but i found the film a pleasant surprise .  and it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising .   a russian janitor ,  misha vilyenkov  ( tony shaloub )  gets a job in a research laboratory .  one day ,  he hears singing coming from the basement .  and when he investigates ,  he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out .  misha becomes fascinated with the bird ,  especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing ,  it can talk .  and not a few phrases either .  its a parrot you can actually make conversation with .   the parrot is called paulie  ( voiced by jay mohr )  ,  and recognises a fellow castaway in misha .  wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement ,  misha convinces paulie to tell him his life story .  which all began when he was a baby ,  and in the care of marie ,  a five year old girl with a stutter .  the two of them became birds of a feather  ( ok ,  bad pun !  )  .   when marie's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird ,  they considered sending him away .  and they finally did after marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching paulie to fly .  desperate to be reunited with her ,  paulie begins a long journey across america ,  which includes a diverse number of new owners ,  flying great distances ,  and even ending up behind bars .  of a cage that is !   paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by dreamworks in the late 90s .  and although it wasn't afforded the same recognition or box-office success of babe ,  paulie succeeds on quite a few levels ,  and is an occasional work of striking intelligence .   jay mohr's stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of paulie .  he never plays the part as too smug ,  even if he is a bit of a smart aleck .  paulie's worldly ,  but he is also naive in his way .   because he's lived a rather sheltered life with marie ,  when he's taken away ,  he has to fend for himself for the first time .  and when he falls into the hands of different owners ,  they make promises to paulie to reunite him with marie ,  which he believes .  only for those promises to be broken time and again .   paulie is admittedly a little episodic .  it follows the eclectic people paulie ends up with ,  and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to marie .  he first winds up in a pawn shop ,  where he is adopted by ivy  ( gena rowlands )  ,  a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners .  she sympathises with paulie's situation ,  and drives an rv across america to find marie .   paulie is an occasionally very touching film .  his scenes with ivy are some of the best .  wonderful moments of paulie perched on her shoulder singing tom jones numbers .  the way she instills in him the need for hope is great ,  and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking :     " there are things in life you put off ,  because you think you're gonna do them later .  but the real thing ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later .  "   the scene where ivy passes away en route leaving paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment .  and the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the grand canyon ,  soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film's over .   despite the occasional sad moment ,  there are plenty of laughs to be had .  paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a spanish outdoor restaurant .  the animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number .  and paulie even gets to have a romance .  which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief  ( played by mohr as well )  .  that may be the only complaint i have .  as soon as you get comfortable with one situation ,  the film then moves paulie on to another .   the scene where paulie is taught to steal money from atm machines is funny ,  but a little disturbing too .  i'm amazed dreamworks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film .  and paulie's diamond robbery is very mission impossible .  he's caught in the act ,  and shipped off to the lab for animal testing ,  where he's remained ever since .   the story finally comes full circle at the lab ,  where misha vows to help paulie .  of course they do find marie .  but the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity ,  i was left numb for several minutes .  paulie may never get the longevity babe has ,  but i believe its an equally brilliant film .  the same laughs .  the same flawless effects .  and the same surprising intelligence .   a minor gem . 
so you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh ?  well ,  think again .  paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments . the characters are all lovable especially paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey . it is journey worth experiencing .  don't miss it !  it is available on home video . 
paulie was cute ,  cool ,  enjoyable and quite fulfilling .  i went to this movie expecting to view a typical  " family "  movie ,  one that within moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor .  my mindframe immediately changed when i was quickly captivated by the movie's wholesomeness .  it is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be coined  " wholesome "  .  most are cheaply made ,  written and produced purely to attract young family members ,  who'll then drag the unfortunate elders to a mind numbing 65 minutes of overused sight gags and plots .   oh yes ,  paulie had a plot .  it told the story of a young girl ( marie )  and her best friend paulie the parrot ,  who unbelievably could talk and quite frequently held conversations with her .  marie's dorky jerk father found this unbelievable ,  and thought paulie to be damaging to his 4-year old daughter's mental health ,  and quickly tore them apart .  we follow paulie's adventures  ( and misadventures )  as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner ,  meeting many memorable characters along the way .  oh yeah ,  paulie really could  ( smart ) talk and had a swift new jersey accent .  cool .  the plot held thick and entertaining throughout ,  keeping me attracted .  paulie is the best family movie i have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed .  ever .  seriously .  pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie ,  with the whole family .  no sleeping .  i promise . 
this is absolutely the best none-animated family film i've seen in quite a while ,  back to the first homeward bound .  paulie is a humerous movie about life through a parrot's pov .  it's a really touching movie and ranks high among family films ,  up to disney status ,  imho . 
i don't know who could find fault with a simply human and funny film like this with lots of delights for your heart .  i enjoyed each minute of it and guessed the ending half way through the movie -- but that did not disappoint me at all .  it will not only touch your heart but it's such a good family friendly film--we need many more like these ! 
i was very surprised with this film .  i was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his  " marie "  the little girl he was separated from .  the humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do .  actually i was expecting  " paulie wants a cracker "  jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference .  so if you wish to see a good  " animal that talks "  film check this one out ,  much better than dr .  dolittle in my opinion .  paulie also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well . 
i was entranced by this touching and hilarious film ,  not to mention surprised .  i was also surprised to find that the voice of paulie was performed by jay mohr .  the performance was so finely nuanced ,  neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the new jersey swagger ,  that i thought that this must be some unsung old pro ,  not the baby-faced mr .  mohr .  a very impressive performance ,  indeed ,  and it's gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky ,  indie films . 
some people might call  " paulie "  a kids' movie ,  but i wish to assert that it's more than that .  probably more than anything else ,  this movie successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the united states - topical given the recent debates .  portraying a parrot telling a russian immigrant janitor  ( tony shalhoub )  of how he searched america for his original owners ,  the movie tells several stories .  there's the elderly woman  ( gena rowlands )  whom he befriends ,  then a mexican immigrant  ( cheech marin )  ,  and others .   all in all ,  it's a very well done movie .  i usually don't expect much from these sorts of movies ,  but this one is a treat .  i certainly recommend it .  also starring jay mohr ,  buddy hackett ,  bruce davison ,  hallie eisenberg and trini alvarado . 
i'm no fan of newer movies ,  but this one was a real pleasure to watch .  adults and children could watch it together - how unusual !  my aunt liked it ,  too .  it had laughter ,  tears ,  love ,  adventure ,  special effects ,  good actors - and a talking parrot .  it reminded me of a favourite ,  the wizard of oz .  the hero ,  paulie ,  an intelligent parrot ,  is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures ,  temptations and disappointments ,  always keeping in mind his resolution to find his friend ,  marie .  highly recommended . 
this is a really heart-warming family movie .  it has absolutely brilliant animal training and  " acting "   ( if you can call it like that )  as well  ( just think about the dog in  " how the grinch stole christmas "  .  .  .  it was plain bad training )  .  the paulie story is extremely well done ,  well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too .  not more to say except that this is a great movie !   my ratings :  story 8 . 5/10 ,  acting 7 . 5/10 ,  animals+fx 8 . 5/10 ,  cinematography 8/10 .   my overall rating :  8/10 - big family movie and very worth watching ! 
miike makes a children's adventure film ,  not unlike the neverending story .  it's actually one of my least favorite of the director's films .  even the worst miike is better than a good many films ,  though ,  and the great yokai war has a lot in it that's worth recommending .  it's at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks .  i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it  ( the dvd includes an english dub )  ,  but ,  like all of miike's films ,  it can tend to move very slowly .  that means you've got kind of a weird unevenness ,  where sometimes there's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse .  the story itself isn't very good ,  either ,  and miike's perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head .  most of what i liked came from the technical side of things .  this has to be miike's most expensive movie ,  and it looks fantastic .   " yokai "  are japanese spirits ,  and they come in all different ,  fantastical forms ,  and the costume designers ,  special effects crew ,  and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job .  i've seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on  ( yokai monsters :  spook warfare )  ,  and the cheesy rubber-suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using state-of-the-art makeup and special effects .  i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys  ( or girls ,  in this case )  ,  agi ,  who sports dark eye shadow ,  a tight ,  white outfit ,  a white beehive hairdo and a whip .  she's played ,  incidentally ,  by chiaki kuriyama ,  whom you might remember as lucy liu's teenage henchgirl in kill bill :  vol .  1 .  the hero of the film is played by ryunosuke kamiki ,  who provided voices for miyazaki's spirited away and howl's moving castle . 
i have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me ,  i cannot understand why some people compare this to babe .  this film is not about the secret life of all animals who secretly can talk .  instead ,  it is about a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner ,  a little girl with a serious stammer ,  overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart-wrenching scene early on .  then the great journey begins .  paulie the parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend ,  marie .   along the way ,  he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people .  he falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her .  he gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him .   he recounts his tale to a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved marie .   tony shaloub shines as the kindly janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little paulie despite the risks .  jay mohr plays the voice of the parrot and one of the seedy characters he comes across .   there is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too .  it is a witty ,  clever ,  epic animal-adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and his little girl .  he search for marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who don ; t know much about parrots .   kids who have seen the wild green parrot tribes in los angeles and pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds ,  especially parrots are not disposable pets .  all children everywhere ,  will see that pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured .   so no babe here ,  more of an incredible journey with a twist .   enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts . 
something about  " paulie "  touched my heart as few movies do .  it is a witty ,  funny yet emotional movie .  i'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie .  i didn't see  " paulie "  until may ,  2004 and have since ordered the widescreen dvd from a seller at ebay .   the special effects of showing paulie talking are superb .  my son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases . probably my favorite part of the movie is when paulie is in gena rowlands  ( ivy's )  company followed by cheech marin  ( ignacio )  .  tony shalhoub  ( misha )  plays an excellent part as the good hearted human .  you root for him all the way through the movie .   you can't go wrong renting or buying this movie !  ! 
somehow ,  this movie manages to be invigorating ,  bittersweet ,  and heartwarming at the same time .  stars like tony shalhoub  ( from providence )  bring the tale to life .  the story itself is inspiring .  we see a desperate ,  up-and-down life through the most innocent eyes imaginable :  a bird's .   paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl  ( played by hallie eisenberg ,  also known as the pepsi girl )  with a speech impediment .  while she learns to speak correctly ,  so does paulie .  however ,  unlike most birds ,  he can speak and understand everything being said .  the military father doesn't like the bird ,  so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist ,  ivy .  she teaches him manners ,  etc .  ,  while traveling across the country to find paulie's owner .  the movie continues with several twists of fate ,  until paulie ends up at a laboratory where he is eventually hidden away in a basement ,  and found by a russian custodian ,  who is touched by the bird's story .  the plot is in keeping with the simple ,  metaphorical theme that language is a gift ,  and a curse .  i would like to say that the soundtrack is astounding .  a beautiful mixture of flute ,  digital base ,  and horns enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy .  the sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery beautify the story even more .  and ,  as a final remark ,  the puppetry is entirely believable .   ( unlike in star wars ,  where yoda resembles a muppet )  this film is one of my favorite movies ,  with the added remark that my wonderful parakeet of four years died recently .  overall ,  i give this movie **** out of four stars ,  two thumbs up ,  and a big hug . 
now ,  i have seen a lot of movies in my day ,  but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me .  and i'm a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience .  this is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies .  almost all the acting is believable ,  the graphics are decent  ( for which you won't even be caring about as you watch the movie .  trust me ,  bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do )  ,  the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kids .   here's basically what this movie made me to .  it one ,  made me laugh .  .  . a lot ,  two ,  made me feel for the characters like you're suppose to ,  and three ,  it's a very uplifting story .  by the end of this movie you will feel good .  sure ,  what anime out there hasn't featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil .  it's a formula that is used a lot .  but ,  in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you'd see 5 years ago ,  the appearance of it is not to be judged .  it's very touching ,  the ending is original ,  and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to .  if you however try comparing this to other movies like  " the never-ending story "  or whatever it will diverse your opinion .  watch it as it is and you will enjoy it .   it has been a good long while since i've been impressed like this .  the only other movie where i have gotten this feeling is when i saw tmnt way back when it came out .  there is something about this movie i felt about tmnt that really made me love it .  so don't over-analyze or take this movie too seriously ,  just enjoy it . 
a fantastic show and an unrealized classic ;  the league of gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times .   with a dark and bizarre style of humor that towers over the tired ,  formulaic approach of it's inferior ,  yet unfortunately far more acknowledged successor ,  little britain ,  the league of gentlemen was truly something special during a rather quiet era in british comedy .   up until it's arrival on the scene ,  there had never really been anything like the league of gentlemen before .  on the surface ,  a seemingly simplistic sketch show ,  the show soon unfolds as a vivid ,  sinister but incredibly hilarious universe populated with all manner of brilliant comedic creations .  what really sets the show apart from it's rivals ,  is it's approach to telling us it's story .  rather than serve us re-hashed sketches ,  barely distinguishable from the next ,  here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various journeys and story lines .  no visit to them is the same ,  and each time they offer us up with a surprise .   gradually ,  over three series' and a christmas special ,  the fictional town of royston vasey is heaving with a grotesque yet hilarious populace .  and that's probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch  ( and also the reason why the show would easily merit more series' )  unlike other current shows like the catherine tate show or more importantly little britain ,  the league both know when a character has run it's course ,  and have the opportunity to deal with that .  several fan favorite's ,  who could have easily been kept on to entertain further ,  bowed out before the series came to a close ,  giving room for fellow characters to grow more ,  or allow for the introduction of newer residents of royston vasey to make their mark .   another thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence .  as mentioned before ,  all four members of the league have a sound mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations ,  and when it's time to call it quits in respect to certain characters .  this awareness has also meant the league of gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution ,  not usually seen in a show of this nature .  the narrative driven ,  and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two series' and this bold move by the league really pays off .  with the third series ,  there's less of an urgency for them to please an audience ,  and like the christmas special ,  they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative ,  unlike the more sketch-based previous series' that  ( succesfully )  binded together various sets of sketches into a series' long story arc .   the third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style ,  as well as a real treat for fans who've already seen the first two .  despite some polarized opinion on the third series ,  any real fan of the league will appreciate what the third series has to offer ,  as well as really enjoy the more character based episodes ,  that only delve deeper into fan favorite's ,  but pair up and inter-wine characters that might not have crossed paths previously .   it might take a little trying to get into the change in style ,  but it's definitely worth it ,  and in my opinion ,  the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the series .   the show's not without it's drawbacks ,  and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place ,  but for the most part ,  the genius writing ,  dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters  ( that are often all too close to real life )  make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent ,  catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame
the town of royston vasey is a weird ,  but wonderful place .  the characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works ,  and it works very well .  most people will know others with a touch of some characters ,  but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as tubbs and edward ,  the stranger-hating owners of the local shop ,  or the pen-obsessed pauline who treats  " dole scum "  with much contempt . that was only a few of the strange inhabitants .  the tv works consists of 3 series and a christmas special .  there are references to many horror films ,  such as the wicker man .  a more recent addition to the range of works is a film ,  the league of gentlemens apocalypse ,  of which i will not say much but highly recommend .  all in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly bonkers characters .  i would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it ! 
one of the best comedy series to ever come out of britain .  mark gatiss , reece shearsmith and steve pemberton are terrific actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy .  ably supported by their writing partner jeremy dyson ,  they have peopled the series with the most memorable characters of recent years .  little britain pales into insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas .  consistently original and groundbreaking i am sure that as many people hate these series as love them but i am equally as sure that no one could have no opinion on log .  i have yet to see the feature length movie but i have heard good things and bad things so i will reserve judgement . the original radio series from which log came was as innovative as the tv series became .  i don't know whether the tv series made it to the us but i would be fascinated to see how american audiences found the weird englishness of the humour
i can't believe it's been ten years since this show first aired on tv and delighted viewers with its unique mixture of comedy and horror .  this is the show that gave birth to a good part of modern british humor :  dr .  terrible's house of horrible ;  garth marenghi's darkplace ;  the mighty boosh ;  snuff box .  many have imitated this show's style ,  and i don't deny some have surpassed its quality .  but jermy dyson deserves being remembered for having started the trend ,  with actors mark gatiss ,  steve pemberton ,  and reece shearsmith .   together they created royston vasey ,  a sinister small town in england's idyllic countryside ,  where unsuspecting tourists and passers-by come across an obsessive couple that wants to keep the town local and free of strangers ;  where the unemployed are abused and insulted at the job center ;  where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows ;  where a vet kills all the animals he tries to cure ;  where a gypsy circus kidnaps people ;  and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to the food to hook people on .   this is just a whiff of what the viewer can find in the league of gentlemen .  by themselves ,  the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters .  the make up and prosthetics are so good i actually thought i watching a lot more actors on the show than there were .  but it's also great acting :  the way they change their voices and their body movement ,  the really become other people .   most of the jokes start with something ordinary ,  from real life ,  and then blows up into something unsettling ,  sometimes gut-wrenching .  sometimes it's pure horror without a set up ,  like in papa lazarou's character .  just imagine a creepy circus owner on make-up barging into someone's house and kidnapping women to be his wives .  no explanation given .  it's that creepy .  then there are the numerous references to horror movies :  se7en ,  the silence of the lambs ,  nosferatu ,  the exorcist ,  etc .   fans of horror will love it ,  fans of comedy will love it .  as any traveler entering knows ,  there's a sign there that says 'welcome to royston vasey :  you'll never leave . ' any viewer who gives this show a chance will agree .  once you discover the league of gentlemen ,  you'll never want anything else ,  you'll never forget it . 
this is probably the best television show i've ever seen .  i first saw it on comedy central several years ago .  at the time i was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order ,  and having just watched all three series in order and unedited  ( thank you internet and your wondrous  " series of tubes "  )  i am so glad i rediscovered it !  i think comedy central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a  " season "  .  .  .  .  .  . and i tried to get friends and family to watch it ,  but nobody really seemed to like it  ( i need new friends )  .  so ,  on my own ,  i made the best out of it that i could .  even when i felt like it was waning a bit ,  i still felt compelled to continue watching .  years after when i discovered little britain ,  i immediately recognized pauline from log as having influenced marjorie in fat fighters .  also ,  i love the idea of writers who act the entire show .  .  .  .  ( not new ,  but done impeccably here )  .  lb has nothing on log !   ( no offense ,  matt & david .  .  .  . love you )  !  this is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius .  serial murder ,  implied cannibalism .  .  .  .  . you name it and it's probably found in this wonderful ,  unique piece of tv art .  the location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of royston vasey .  .  .  .  . you'll never leave !  i think my favorite character would have to be tubbs ,  but each character as portrayed has it's own  " charm "  .  my least favorite was papa lazarous ,  that was until he re-surfaced in series three  ( clever and wholly unexpected )  !  it's best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as i said before ,  becomes so compelling  ( while repulsing )  that you really can't stop watching .  this is not for those with weak stomachs ,  kids ,  conservatives or grandma  ( unless you've got one saucy granny )  !  i have always loved british tv ,  particularly comedies ,  from monty python to benny hill ,  red dwarf to keeping up appearances ,  absolutely fabulous and the british originals coupling and the office  ( but not their us counterparts .  .  .  . sorry )  .  this is unlike any of those in that it completely redraws the line between what's funny and what's just sick and twisted .  nothing ,  nothing on us tv has ever come close to this level of entertainment .  us broadcast tv is so sad and lame ,  i can barely stand to watch any of it .  it's kind of sad that even our cable channels don't have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem  ( your loss ,  comedy central )  .  thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the  " across the pond "  that redeem the entire medium every decade or so .  basic cable here in the us has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently  " crossing lines "  with more graphic sexual content ,  drug use and adult language ,  but they are still years away from just deciding to be adults about showing real life ,  adult behavior  ( instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up ,  sheesh ,  it's like the same basic show format for the past 35 years )  !  don't even get me started on us sitcoms !  waste of time and lots of wasted money .  .  .  .  .  . did you know that  " according to jim "  has been on the air for 10 years ?  ?  ?  10 years ?  ?  anyway .  .  .  watch this show ,  get it on dvd ,  do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well !  you've never seen anything like it .  there are three specials that i have not watched yet .  .  .  . i'm saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits .  he'll watch them ,  even if i have to chain him up and paint him with excrement !  lines and lines and lines and lines !  note that series three departs from one and two .  .  .  . the greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters ,  the laugh track is gone  ( thank bloody hell )  ,  the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of royston vasey .  don't be thrown by any of that as by the end ,  the series has preserved the quiet perversity first demonstrated in series one and two .  i think these four guys have created something sort of undefinable .  brilliant ,  confident and absolutely demented .  you will want to re-watch it again and again .  it's amazing that in 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight-gag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors close-up facial expression .  if ever i were to meet any of the writer/performers ,  i'd implore them not to recreate it or try to top it .  .  .  .  . i'd just say  " can i help you at all ?  "   ( then they'd probably slap me ,  so i'd ask them to sign the slap-mark )  !  10 out of 10
the league of gentlemen is one of the funniest ,  strangest ,  darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time .  so much so ,  it paved the way for more comedies of its ilk ,  many of which have copied the style ,  but have never succeeded .   unlike every other sketch show around ,  the characters of the league of gentlemen are all loosely connected .  firstly they all live in the fictional town of royston vasey ,  in the back of beyond of northern england .    the first characters to greet newcomers are tubbs and edwrad ,  the pig-faced owners of a supposedly local shop situated so far away most of the residents probably don't know of its existence .  other oddities include :  the denton family ,  with an obsession with hygiene ,  chastity and toads ;  hillary briss who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat ;  pauline ,  a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens ;  mr .  chinnery ,  kind-hearted vet and menace to all things four-legged ;  geoff tipps ,  a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humour ,  often involving guns ,  electric tubes and  .   .   .   .   .   .   .  plums !  !  !  !  !    despite being a comedy at heart ,  the league of gentlemen often transcends genres whilst never appearing to be spoofing or ripping off other people's material .  there are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker ,  a pair of silent twins ,  an obsessive circus owner ,  and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds .  even more striking are moments when the series takes on a more sobre tone and aforementioned characters such as pauline and geoff are shown in a more sympathetic ,  vulnerable light .  the film adaptation is the best demonstration of this ,  but some fans may decide they belong local .   the equally underrated third series also takes a different route ,  instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each storyline leading to one conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theatre company van .  although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two ,  they're certainly signs to how inventive the league of gentlemen can be ,  and how unafraid to explore new areas .   in short ,  the league of gentlemen is definitely worth a look ,  as like the welcome signs says :  you'll never leave ! 
about a year ago i finally gave up on american television .  i thought of giving up television completely until a friend who had lived in england showed me some programs that included the office ,  extras ,  blackadder ,  and the league of gentlemen .  it was then that i decided to switch to british television .  among all the shows listed above ,  the league of gentlemen is easily the most dark and twisted of them all ,  providing guilty laughs and material not found in any other comedy i've seen yet .  characters included are the most unhappily married couple ,  a butcher that puts ingredients in the meat that go unsaid  ( probably for the best )  ,  a deranged couple that look over a local shop that only caters to local people ,  and the worst veterinarian ever .  this program is one of the best i've seen . 
i never really watched this program before although it came highly recommended by members of my family .  funnily enough ,  my girlfriend lives in hadfield  ( the filming location )  and she pointed out a few landmarks when i first visited .   this got my interest going so i bought the 1st series on video and sat down to watch .  besides recognising some of the locations ,  i found myself not in the least bit surprised .  once again the bbc were responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world .  tlog easily ranks up there with red dwarf ,  fawlty towers and monty python as probably the best .   suffice to say i am hooked on the program now .  the characters are superb and show unusual depth while retaining a scarily realistic edge .  the look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes bleak feeling of the north  ( no disrespect to hadfield which i have found a very welcoming and warm place )  .   i only hope that it continues its originality throughout its run  ( which based upon the 2nd series which concluded its rerun in the uk last night ,  it certainly is )  .   well done the bbc !  ! 
i first flicked onto the log accidentally one night while waching television :  since then ,  i have never missed an episode .   it's humour is very weird ,  like a cross between brass eye's social commentary ,  the fast show's excellent one-liners ,  and an amazing plot that seems to develop each week without ever going anywhere .  the best example of this was hillary briss's special stuff - what was that all about ?   the humour will not appeal to all .  some will say it's just too sick ,  and it's easy to see where they're coming from .  nonetheless ,  give it a try .  if you don't like it ,  don't watch it ,  but if you do like it you'll be very glad you took my advice . 
this is what makes me proud to be british .  this is by far the funniest thing on tv .  the league consists of jeremy dyson ,  steve pemberton ,  mark gatiss and the lovely reece shearsmith .  totally underrated ,  this horror-comedy is perfection .  the characters are iconic and the catchphrases bizarre ,   " hello dave "  .  it is a comedy that everyone simply must watch .   the best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh ,  and always pushing the boundaries .  it does not need to rely on catchphrases ( unlike little britain )  for it to be funny .  the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters ,  shows us that they've got balls of steel . 
well ,  i just discovered that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than  " little britain "  and i like it !   " the league of gentlemen "  is a sick british comedy that is about the most awful ,  insane and disgusting small town in all the uk .  this place makes dibley and craggy island  ( from  " the vicar of dibley "  and  " father ted "  )  seem pretty normal !  !  the format of the show is a lot like little britain except that all of it centers around the townspeople of this one hellish town .  both shows feature the same skits again and again every episode and some obviously inspired  " little britain "   ( particularly the job seeking class skit )  .  but the show differs because although it is crude like  " little britain "   ( hence not a show for kids )  ,  the show has a sick and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these shows .  in particular ,  animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show .   now if you haven't guessed ,  this is not a show for kids ,  the easily offended or normal people and that's probably why i liked it .  however ,  you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful to enjoy this to the max .  funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief--you have to see it to believe it . 
another review likened this troupe to a cross between monty python and twin peaks ,  also aptly .  yet another review expounded on the differences between the comedy we enjoy non-critically and black comedy ,  also well worth consideration .   watch the whole thing ,  all three series .  at the end ,  all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a douglas adams novel .  the detail and intricacies are staggering .  thoroughly post-modern .  wickedly funny ,  and startlingly tragic .  not for kids .  not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity .  thought-provoking .  at once literal ,  figurative ,  and surreal in disturbing ways .  the blackest comedy i can recall .   and very possibly the most wonderful thing i will ever see . 
this series premiered on the cable tv station  " comedy central "  in the united states .  it was chopped to death ,  and shown out of sequence .  this was sad for the audience it should have attracted ,  it didn't and fell by the wayside .  luckily ,  at the same time my cable company went digital and i got the bbc .  thank goodness because i got to see  " the league of gentlemen "  in order ,  complete and uncut .     " the league of gentlemen "  troupe is right up there with england's  " monty python's flying circus "  and canada's  " the kids in the hall "  .  but .  . a warning .    " the league of gentlemen "  though are one step beyond .  it's not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills ,  it goes deeper and much ,  much ,  darker .  i can tell many of you now -- it will offend certain groups of people ,  it will enrage others .  but remember ,  its only comedy .  . dark ,  dark comedy .  if that is not your thing ,  don't watch .  if you think you know dark comedy ,  watch this -- if you get angry and upset ,  then you don't quite know dark comedy .    these guys got it right ,  and right on the button .  they are brilliant ,  they are excellent and i enjoyed each and every character creation .  there's a complete story that is told here from episode one to the end .  you cannot watch this one episode at a time ,  willy nilly ,  that is one of the charms of this series .  watch it in order .  see how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are .  no one and nothing is out of bounds .  that ,  my dears ,  is  " dark humor "  .  bravo ! 
what do you get if you cross the matrix with the truman show ?   i'm sure you've all seen the matrix by now .  the creators of the matrix say that it is 'anime inspired' .  just from watching the trailer to this classic ,  you can see where they took the plot from .   the film is sort of set in 1980s japan ,  and it really shows .  the costumes ,  music and words ( in the recent english language version by ad vision )  are all like they've been directly lifted from the era .  i believe it was made in that time also ,  but due to certain plot points ,  this doesn't date the film !   as you probably guessed by my referencing to the matrix ,  the world isn't real .  it's not really the 1980's .  in fact ,  it's something more like the 2480's .  after a nuclear war ,  the earth ( or  " biosphere prime "  ) 's ecosystem was destroyed .  the survivors we're forced to escape into space ,  where the conflict continued .  once the planets ( or  " biospheres "  )  were all abandoned ,  people began to live in megazones - cities inside of spaceships ,  where ,  via hypnotism techniques and truman show-esque illusion ,  they were made to believe they we're back on earth ,  in the most peaceful time in recent memory .  .  .  the 1980s .  when young shogo obtains a mysterious advanced looking motorcycle ,  it leads him to find out more than he's supposed to know .  .  .  the garland ( a bike which becomes a mech )  ,  a weapon from the 2400's ,  aids shogo in his escape from the pursuing military .  as more and more is discovered about the megazone ,  the war comes closer to home ,  and due to conflicts between the military and the computer ,  the war comes to the megazone too .  .  .  i apologise if those points are seen as spoilers ,  but the plot is outlined basically that way on the synopsis .   emotions run high in this movie ,  moreso than the matrix .  you really do believe the war is going on ,  and shogo really does become quite scarred by what he's discovering .  what starts off as an uber-happy cool 80's flick becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality .  these characters are real people ,  not the cardboard cutouts we saw flipping around in bullet-time in the matrix .  there really is the sense of the suffering people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy ,  and a war .  it may just choke you up towards the end .  .  .  i know it did me .   animation is pretty impressive for it's day ,  and the picture quality on the advision dvd is unbelievable for it's age .  the artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime ,  very cultural .  be prepared for quite a lot of violence and blood ,  there's also an erotic sex scene .   the ending can be seen as a 'there can be no ending' ,  similar to the matrix ,  or ,  supposedly can be followed by the sequel ,  which i haven't yet had the pleasure of watching .   i have to say that this is one of the best animes i've seen ,  in fact ,  one of the best movies i've seen ,  and considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all time .   i must recommend the advision dvd ,  as their take on the english language is incredible ,  and does the movie justice ,  and can be purchased with an artbox for holding the two sequels when they are released ,  which will have the same vocal cast .   all in all ,  megazone 23 is an incredible movie ,  and deserves to be held highly ,  and should be an essential in any anime fan's collection .  heck ,  even my mother enjoyed it . 
here's the skinny ,  it seems that this is much older then i thought it was .  but it's still cool .  the bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part .  there are some character issues that i hope work themselves out by part 2 and my biggest complaint of all that it seems to be a macross knock off .  not just the animation style but several character designs .  for example all the girls in this movie look like lyn minmay of macross .  the mechs look similar to macross as well as the other characters .  this is really not made for little kids ,  it has graphic violence ,  nudity and graphic sexual content .  so to make a long story short i give this cool macross knock-off 7 stars . 
to like this movie at most you must be a ) strongly in love  ( without a marriage )  b )  acknowledge english humor which is about admiring gallant and witty life situations and not just running gags c )  be fairly very intelligent ,  because authors gave an opportunity to laugh and cry over every single minute of this movie ,  and only if you meet  " b "  and  " c "  requirements ,  you can recognize and enjoy author's input .  d )  to fully enjoy the movie you must love women like kirsted dunst ,  who is so natural ,  sweet and irresistible .  e ) you must admire creative ,  a little melancholic people with great and remarkable personalities  if you meet all these requirements you'll be likely to rate this movie near 10 points .   i never laughed half (  !  )  as much as from watching this masterpiece .  and i even managed to cry while laughing in some moments  ( i always get sensitive ,  whenever good things happen to kirsten dunst ) 
how to lose friends & alienate people is in all honesty one of the best comedies i've seen this year along with pineapple express and step brothers .  its not one of those  " gross out "  comedies that heavily relies on fart jokes and toilet humor but instead moves at an affable pace and you will be easily attached to the unfolding narrative .  simon pegg nails it in the coffin with his hilarious portrayal of a fish-out-of-water character and is quickly detaching himself from the tripod he once belonged to back in england  ( the other two would be nick frost and edgar wright )  .  getting yourself in the top of the hollywood food chain is a hard thing to do as we can clearly see with pegg ,  his first jab at the lead role was david schwimmer's comedy run fatboy run but it received lukewarm reviews from critics and audiences alike .  his second try is this movie ,  got fairly positive reviews from the majority but was a flop in the box office .  i ,  for one still haven't lost faith in him and i'll still be there whenever he wants to take that third shot for glory .   other characters were well cast from jeff bridges to danny huston and gillian anderson .  surprisingly ,  kirsten dunst in my opinion fared well in this movie as the love angle to pegg's character however ,  the spark that i saw in interview with the vampire is still lost .  she needs to find it ,  fast or she might suffer the consequences of being lost in the land of  " rom-coms "  forever . 
possible spoiler - in some way  " how to alienate friends .  .  .  .  "  is the  " loser learns to adjust ,  becomes successful and finds out that something else matter more "  type of story ,  situated in the celebrity business .  - end of spoiler   i don't know the original book but this comedy delivers several good moments .  though i do think the ending is flawed .  it felt too fast and too abrupt ,  as if something was missing .  besides i'd say the movie isn't able to keep a high level .  apart from this you'll find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting qualities .  until now i've never seen pegg any different .  still he is a very unique type though on the screen he sometimes might seem a little more tedious than necessary .  fox proved she is capable to play a hot starlet with her head in the clouds .  don't know whether it was a hard thing to do ,  but her performance was hot and way better than during  " transformers "   ( okay .  .  .  probably that's no tough match )  .  kirsten dunst is very much kirsten dunst  ( again )  and you may like it  ( as i do )  or find it annoying .  on the other hand you'll see anderson who proved her acting skills and jeff bridges  ( who is fine but perhaps he could have acted a little more powerful )  .  they all fit their character well enough .   conclusion :  i think it's a nice celeb comedy with some more and some less funny passages ,  a sweet cast but an all too sudden ending . 
this film is a bit reminiscent of the german film ,  the neverending story because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero .  however ,  due to far superior modern technology ,  puppets and cgi are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world--one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope .   i enjoyed this film ,  but boy was it a chore at first !  unfortunately ,  for most westerners ,  this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd .  however ,  give it a chance .  don't think or try to understand everything you see--just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film .   in many ways ,  this is exactly the sort of advice i'd give to adults who watch miyazaki's spirited away because it is very similar and features tons of yokai  ( japanese mythical spirits )  .  the big differences between the two is that the great yokai war is live-action and spirited away is much more child-friendly .  while i do think the great yokai war was intended mostly as a kids' movie ,  in the usa ,  most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it's so violent ,  scary and features some adult behaviors .  so who is the audience in the west ?  well ,  older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-western themes and composition .  this is a rather narrow audience ,  indeed !    while you are watching ,  look for all the strange little touches .  in fact ,  you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time .  a few of the funny references i liked were the comment about gamera ,  the scene that came with the comment  " kids :  don't try this at home "  as well as the use of kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the yokai  ( hmm ,  .  .  . perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning )  !    by the way ,  director takashi miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically ,  other than to say that none of his stories i've seen have seemed  " normal "  .  some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and i hated them  ( especially audition and ichi the killer ) whereas some of them are magical and among the best films i've ever seen  ( the happiness of the katakuris )  .  one thing for sure ,  it's hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other . 
going into this movie ,  i had heard good things about it .  coming out of it ,  i wasn't really amazed nor disappointed .  simon pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies .  there were a couple of laughs here and there-- nothing too funny .  probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he dances in the club scene .  i totally gotta try that out next time i find myself in a club .  a couple of stars here and there including :  megan fox ,  kirsten dunst ,  that chick from x-files ,  and jeff bridges .  i found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance of thandie newton in a scene .  she of course being in a previous movie with simon pegg ,  run fatboy run .  i see it as a toss up ,  you'll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull .  i might add ,  kirsten dunst is adorable in this movie .   : 3

how to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach .   it's actually a story of sidney young ( simon pegg )  breaking through in journalist and magazine writing business which is interpreted in a funny way .  simon pegg made an ok appearance ,  slightly worse than his usual .  movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that but it has its moments ,  and those moments are really hilarious .   i recommend this fun and worth watching american with english cream comedy to all people who just wanna sit ,  relax and enjoy movie for what it is .  if you're about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it . 
simon pegg plays the part of sidney young ,  a young entertainment writer who has begun the beginnings of a career writing for a grassroots magazine that specializes in badmouthing the shallowness and superficiality of the rich and famous .  he is making a career out of lampooning celebrities ,  although he has a desperate wish to be a celebrity himself .  the movie is based on the very bizarre career of toby young ,  who also ran a small magazine in britain called the modern review ,  which offered scathing criticism of pretty much everything imaginable ,  until he closed the magazine in a hail of verbal bullets with his co-editor ,  and then went on to a spectacularly failed career as a writer for vanity fair ,  which is pretty much the part of his life told in this movie .    he is at first thrilled to go work for a major publication  ( called sharp's magazine in the movie )  ,  and despite active nerves he is positively beaming on his first day .  he meets the chief editor ,  clayton harding  ( played by jeff bridges )  ,  who is hard as nails but who is also exactly the kind of editor he needs to be for a goof-off like young to keep his job at the magazine .  he offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of young ,  but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance of young's off-the-wall antics and inappropriate behavior .    much of the comedy in the movie is derived from young's misunderstanding of or indifference to the generally accepted code of public behavior and the peculiar etiquette involved in dealing with the rich and famous .  but sidney's reasons for acting in such a weird way and for giving outwardly offensive interviews is because he believes that he loathes the entire celebrity culture and ,  it would seem ,  he believes in that age-old saying  'if you can't beat 'em ,  join 'emand then beat 'em .  "   complicating matters are two very different women .  there is a charming ,  regular girl at the magazine named alison olsen  ( kirsten dunst )  who at first is appalled by sidney's obvious arrogance and womanizing ways ,  and a stunning model named sophie  ( megan fox )  ,  who represents the celebrity culture .  needless to say ,  sidney's endless attack of superficiality and stardom is a superficial lust for sophie ,  the one with the look of a star .   sophie is stunningly beautiful ,  it's true ,  but also comes across as having not a single thought rattling around in her head .  alison is a regular girl ,  not very interesting or attractive ,  but dunst's performance makes her a real person .  a relationship with her would have all the reality of a britney spears marriage ,  and yet the movie retains some level of believability because ,  despite how obvious this is ,  we also feel sidney's pain in not pursuing her  ( i felt it ,  anyway )  .   how to lose friends and alienate people has a pretty interesting premise and is full of honest ,  satisfactory performances ,  and although it turns into a bit of your standard romantic comedy by the third act ,  it has a variety of well-developed and interesting characters .  danny huston ,  for example ,  gives us a great performance as alison's other love interest ,  who pays homage to the big lebowski  ( also starring bridges )  with his ever-present white russian ,  one of my personal favorite drinks .  buying absolute and kahlua here in china costs the equivalent of about $350 ,  but my kitchen is never without them .    i am looking forward to the day when simon pegg will branch out a little bit ,  because i love his films but i am completely unsure about his range .  he played a serious character in hot fuzz ,  but only serious in relation to the lunacy surrounding him ,  and ultimately went back to being himself again ,  which he has pretty much been in shaun of the dead ,  run ,  fat boy ,  run ,  and now how to lose friends .  he's a rising star ,  it will be interesting to see what else he can do . 
i really ,  really enjoyed watching this movie !  at first ,  seeing its poster i thought it was just another easy romantic comedy  .  .  .  but it is simply more than this !  i personally believe that this idea  ( that i'm sure a good part of the viewers had just before they saw the movie )  it's yet another important part of the big concept of this movie itself  ( or even of its marketing strategy )  !  what i mean is :  nowadays we are slaves to images !  to impressions !  i went to the cinema to view this film having the wrong impression ,  the wrong expectations ,  and at the end i felt how superficial i could be !  to exemplify it comes to my mind the sequence near the end in which sidney buys the plane ticket to go back to new york and as he is asked to 'give an autograph' ,  meaning to sign for the ticket ,  he believes that just because he got on tv thanks to the scandal at the awards he is now some kind of celebrity .  and this is just ,  i believe ,  the climax of this main theme around which the movies revolves .  above this ,  i believe the movie also offers us a solution to get along with this ,  illustrated throughout the movie by sidney's attitude :  don't become too serious about yourself or about anybody else  .  .  .   " even saints were people in the beginning "   .  .  .  as sophie once says in the movie .  the saints of the moment are the stars .  we attribute them an 'aura' of perfection ,  of eternal happiness ,  but the reality is much less than that .  even the saints of any religion are images ,  ideal models of how to behave and how to live your life .  even they were not for real  .  .  .  they became 'for real' after they died and we looked back at them .  and that's the catch :  we need our saints !  we need our stars !  we strive for them as if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have anything to strive for .  and television and all other media are means to create and capture our strivings .  we desperately need benchmarks in regard to which to measure ourselves .  and that's how we got in the cinema to watch this movie in the first place :  to see if we can fit the benchmark ,  or if the benchmark is to small for us .  this time it was larger than we expected . 
i love kristen dunst ,  especially in elizabethtown .  i guess she's the kind of actress who had better not act before camera ,  but just be herself .  she did that ,  and she looked so natural in elizabethtown .  in this movie ,  however ,  she did try to add in more artificial performance ,  especially in the first half of the film ,  so that she looked more like a sober editor .  while in the other half ,  she totally set herself back in her daily track ,  and i just couldn't tell her to be an editor any way .  therefore ,  her performance is not enduring in this film .    the film , on the whole ,  is attracting and inspiring .  the character of young is full and reasonable .  anyway ,  the film tells a big and sophisticated story .    the only big defect is that it didn't show a turning point of the hero and heroine's love story .  i am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story ,  because that is rather unclear for the two persons . 
 " how to lose friends & alienate people "  is not based on tiger woods' infidelities .  it is a mediocre romantic comedy based on toby young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities .  the film stars simon pegg as sidney young ,  a zany british journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in new york .  young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him ,  hence movie title .  he is uproarious ,  daring ,  and moronic .  but nevertheless for some very bizarre reason ,  he is a somewhat likable character .  sidney befriends a fellow journalist ,  the composed alison olsen ,  played quite admirably by kirsten dunst .  however ,  sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress sophie maes played by the fantastic ms .  megan fox .  this foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on  " eye candy "  material .  sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co .  those are the peak comedic moments of the film .  however ,  i think that director robert weide and screenwriter peter straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic rom-com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between sidney & alison ;  even though team weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise .  pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as sidney young .  jeff bridges was again building  " the dude "  bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as clayton harding ,  the magazine's suave prez .  but the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here .   " how to lose friends & alienate people "  should not be alienated entirely ,  but you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy .  *** average
well it was a nice surprise after all .  its trailer did not predict a good film at all ,  it was even a bit misleading .  especially the part of jeff bridges was a positive surprise ,  well written ,  sardonic and funny .  less real though ,  i do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such irreverence towards everything that his current company stands for .  one does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again .  the ending of the film ,  during the showing of dolce vita ,  was too corny ,  cliché and quite disappointing .  and of course a guy like pegg's character would not last past his first week in a blitz new york magazine like this .  i hope one day i will see a decent role written for megan fox ,  here she looked a poor actress playing a bimbo .  and by the way ,  i do not see why she is the  " sex symbol "  of the year ,  i see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine . 
simon pegg plays a rude crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from england to work for a big american magazine .  of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications .  amusing fact based comedy that co stars kristen dunst  ( looking rather grown up )  ,  danny huston ,  and jeff bridges .  it works primarily because we like simon pegg despite his bad behavior .  we completely understand why kristen dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups .  i liked the film .  its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies .   7 out of 10
i am a huge fan of simon pegg and have watched plenty of his movies until now and none of them have ceased to make me laugh .  neither did how to lose friends and alienate people .   this movie is essentially about a man good as pissing people off .  however ,  he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that might just make him famous .  but in the end he ends up doing them ,  the culture of life .   the movie is well toned with humor ,  romance ,  good acting and also a bit of a lap dance .  its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends . 
weak start ,  solid middle ,  fantastic finish .  that's my impression of this film ,  anyway .  i liked simon pegg in the two films i've seen him in--- hot fuzz ,  and shaun of the dead .  his role here ,  though ,  took a completely different turn .  shows his range as an actor ,  but nonetheless i really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginning .   there's a kind of humour i call  " frustration comedy .  "  its supposed  " jokes "  and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments .  much like the bean character rowan atkinmson plays .  there are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too .  i don't mean to bash them here ,  so will not .   but do be warned that if you are like me ,  and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots ,  pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film .  it does get better ,  however .   i read somewhere that this is based on a true story .  hmmm .  maybe .  the film's story stopped being annoying ,  and became kind of a triumph of the  " little guy "  in the final third .  i don't need all films to be sugar and light--- but coincidentally ,  as this film got better ,  it also started to be more and more of a happy ending .   it was also a pleasure to see an old favourite ,  jeff bridges ,  play a role so masterfully .  i liked  " iron man ,  "  but was saddened by the fact that bridges' character was a villain .  purely personal taste ,  of course ,  as his acting in that was superb .  nonetheless ,  he was a marvel here as the bigger than life man of vision ,  the publisher of sharps .  it was nice to see him in a role that i could actually enjoy .   overall then ,  i liked it !  i just wish i had come in 40 minutes late ,  and missed the beginning . 
wow !  so much fun !  probably a bit much for normal american kids ,  and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film ,  this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits - very terry gilliam all the way through .  while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward ,  miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel-esquire moments .  the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid/hero ,  with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein .  and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike's work ,  the layers of meaning and metaphor ,  particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly ,  is pretty damn poignant .  as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films ,  only instead of over the top torture and gore ,  he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure .  f'n rad ,  and one of miike's best ! 
uk newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know toby young ,  the journalist on whose real-life experiences this movie is based .  the key word here is  " based "  .  how to lose friends is a fictitious romcom .   sidney young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in new york ,  where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally getting it right and making it .  this involves him selling out ,  and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity .  however ,  they are not overdone :  the main substance remains a comedy which centres around sidney's misadventures .  the script has its cake and eats it in that sidney is a stupid ,  well-meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart ,  moderately obnoxious skilled writer .  this contradiction is never that much of an issue ,  because simon pegg  ( as sidney )  projects likability too well .   jeff bridges underplays sidney's editor a little too effectively ,  and kirsten dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of sidney's affections and ,  with regard to megan fox  ( who plays an airhead bimbo starlet )  ,  i can say only this :  just say the word ,  miss fox ,  and i will leave my wife ,  sell all my belongings ,  and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort .  of course ,  given that i'm a fat 56-year-old english accountant ,  you might not find my offer too enticing ,  but it's there on the table anyway .  given how short her career has been so far ,  one might think it is a little too soon for megan fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become :  however ,  she does it sweetly ,  with some skill ,  and extremely sexily .  this girl will go far .   there is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers - miriam margolyes and bill paterson from the uk ,  gillian anderson and danny huston from the us .   there are several laugh-out-loud moments ,  and i smiled most of the way through .  as ever ,  the f-word makes appearances when it really doesn't need to ,  although at least a couple of these are very funny . 
sidney young  ( pegg )  moves from england to new york to work for the popular magazine sharpe's in a hope to live his dream lifestyle but struggles to make a lasting impression .   based on toby young's book about survival in american business ,  this comedy drama received mixed views from critiques .  labelled as inconsistently funny but with charm by the actors ,  how to lose friends seemed as a run of the mill fish out of the pond make fun at another culture comedy ,  but it isn't .   this 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story .  we start off in the past ,  then in the present and are working our way forwards to see how young made his mark at one of america's top magazines .   pegg  ( hot fuzz )  is too likable for words .  whether it's hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the english actor brings a charm and light heartedness to every scene .  here ,  when the scripting is good but far from his own standards ,  he brings a great deal of energy to the picture and he alone is worth watching for .  his antics with  " babe 3 "  are unforgivable ,  simply breathtaking stuff as is his over exuberant dancing ,  but he pulls it off splendidly .   bridges and anderson do well at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses where dunst fits in nicely to the confused love interest .  megan fox ,  who stole transformers ,  reminds everyone she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype film star .  the fact that her character sophie myles is starring in a picture about mother teresa is as laughable as her character's antics in the pool .  to emphasize the point there is a dog ,  and pegg rounds that off in true brit style comedy ,  with a great little twist .   though a british film there is an adaptation of american lifestyle for young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to story telling .  young wants the down right dirty contrasted with the american professionalism .  the inclusion of modern day tabloid stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film star's gives this edge .   weide's first picture is not perfect .  there are lapses in concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary .  the physical comedy can also be overdone .  as a side note ,  the bloopers on the dvd are some of the finest you will ever see ,  which are almost half an hour long .   this comedy drama has simon pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy ,  it is worth watching . 
how to lose friends and alienate people came out in 2008 .  it bombed at u . s .  box offices .  it's an absolutely hilarious film with a great cast .  simon pegg is great playing sidney young ,  who wrote the book  " how to lose friends and alienate people .  i know it's not a true story .  the only way i know that is because sidney wants to go out with an actress named sophie maes .  sophie maes doesn't exist ,  but other than that ,  the film could be real .  how to lose friends and alienate people is probably the funniest film of 2008 ,  and i think you definitely should see it .  as i said earlier ,  the film has a fantastic cast including :  kirsten dunst ( spider-man ,  the virgin suicides )  danny huston ( the number 23 ,  30 days of night )  gillian anderson ( the x-files )  megan fox ( transformers ,  confessions of a teenage drama queen )  jeff bridges ( the big lebowski ,  the vanishing )  overall ,  how to lose friends and alienate people is hilarious .  i think simon pegg and kirsten dunst do work well together ,  and i think you should see it .  though there is some odd nudity including trans-sexuals ,  it's a hilarious and awesome comedy .  one of simon pegg's best .   the plot : sidney young ,  a journalist from england ,  travels down to new york to work at sharp magazines .  while there ,  he meets an actress named sophie maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss does . 
'how to lose friends and alienate people' is an entertaining ,  if loose ,  adaptation of toby young's memoir of the same name .  it's also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in imdb reviews !  the basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised ,  but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly hollywoodised .  simon pegg ,  despite playing an essentially irritating person ,  is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film .  strange to think only a few years ago he was just a tv sitcom guy and now he's rubbing shoulders with hollywood names .  there's a good supporting cast and it's an amusing ,  easy watch - kind of a male 'ugly betty' ,  but funnier . 
well here comes another , well , romantic comedy .  .  . but unlike all others movies of this genre , this is by far the best i have seen in a long while .  .   i'll admit , at first i wanted to watch this movie because of megan fox , and a little because of simon pegg .  .  .   first of all , if you have watched a decent amount of movies , you will know that sidney and alison would be together at the and of the movie , one way or another .  .  . but from the beginning to the end of the movie you won't know how .  .  .   okay , now this movie is just made for simon pegg . i can't see any other actor in the role of sidney , and i'm sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for pegg's great performance .   there is a number of great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing really hard , courtesy of simon pegg's character sidney .  .  . but i think everyone in this movie is good . for example , kirsten dunst is really solid in this movie (  i usually don't think of her as any more than an average actress , but she was really good in this one  )  , then there's jeff bridges , there's gillian anderson , and of course megan fox who plays spoiled bitchy star sophie maes .  .  . great role for her .  .  .   all in all , while i usually don't agree with ratings her on imdb , this time i would completely agree with them .  .  .   go and see this movie , it is really light-hearted and positive , and i recommend it deeply .  .  .  my rating 7 out of 10 .  .  . well 7 . 5 actually .  .  . 
romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe  " how to lose friends & alienate people "  .  the underlying romance in the plot is ,  for the most part ,  displaced by a far more interesting  " rags to riches "  tale .  although the central line of the story is somewhat rushed passed ,  in several screen shots ,  it does have a sense of ;  getting the  " nitty gritty "  out of the way ,  focusing on those key relationships which make  " office politics "  and using those almost irrelevant scenes ,  used purely for comic effect .  yet it works so well ,  especially with pegg in the front seat .  the film is ultimately very clever ,  playing well on the trans-atlantic relationship pegg shares with his co-stars and merging the cross between the high and low -life society quite well and quite refreshingly in a storyline that despite predictability is somewhat of a unique journey .  the different characters in the film are presented well and casting is definitely a plus point on the film .  both the  " trading places "  relationship between pegg and huston and the  " love ,  hate "  relationship between pegg and dunst do work so well in a story that is ,  for want of a better word ,  charming .  even fox ,  whose main asset is of course sex appeal ,  shocks with what turns out to be quite a dark character and acts that  " bimbo "  role all to well .  its one of these films where every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work .  from transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack it all meshes nicely into what can only be described as clever comedy . 
pegg has had a few hits in the past few years ,  starting with  " shaun of the dead "  in 2004 ,  movie on to  " hot fuzz 2007 "  ,  early 2008 he came out with  " run fat boy run "  and now comes this ,   " how to lose friends and alienate people "  which is in many ways one of my favourite comedy's of the year .   the film is about sidney yound ,  a man who writes a failing magazine who makes fun of celebrity's mostly because he is not one of them .  anyway ,  one of the most successful magazine owners  ( played by jeff bridges )  invites him  ( out of nostalgia )  to work at his magazine .  sidney is of course excited and moves to america ,  there he meets a girl currently writing a book ,  and hilarity ensues .   this film is great and i hope more come out like it in the near future .  pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and i cant wait to the see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy  " paul "  .  i rate this film 81% . 
amazing performance from simon pegg who just gets better and better with every role .  as usual he plays the part of a very cringy character who makes you want to hide behind your cushion in embarrassment for him sometimes ,  but thats what pegg is all about .   the laughs were regular and eye watering and everyone of them aimed at penn .  the movie was very cleverly put together where every character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with penn being the only humour involved which is a huge credit to the director robert weide .   and i cant let this one go without a quick round of applause to gilliam anderson who shone throughout .  highly recommended to all . 
oh dear we don't like it when our super-hero love interest develops a brain do we ?   something has happened to people ,  they have lost the ability to enjoy ,  a simple feel-good ,  love story/comedy ?  kirsten dunst is a revelation - funny ,  sexy and real .  i laughed out loud ooh at least five times and i'm not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too .  the cast ,  acting and script is great ,  i watch a lot of films right across the board and i haven't seen one in this genre that has been as successful .  those who disagree please tell me where i can find some !  i'm sure the book is good too but i think you have to judge it on its own merits . 
i had fun watching this movie ,  mainly due to simon pegg ,  who has quickly become a solid box office draw for comedy films .   he is hired from his dead end london publishing job by big shot nyc media mogul jeff bridges ,  as a writer ,  for one of his celebrity rags .   after paying his dues ,  he makes it into the higher echelons of celebrity writing hackdom  ( the  " seventh room "  )  ,  where he gets to be a minor celebrity himself .  the storyline is very funny ,  and gillian anderson puts in an impressive supporting role as a cutthroat publicity agent .   along the way to success ,  he finds the true meaning of love ,  etc .   the formulaic plot aside ,  the movie was very funny ,  mainly due to simon pegg ,  jeff bridges ,  and gillian anderson .  kirsten dunst was good as the love interest .  the rest of the supporting cast did its job well .   this was a good comedy & well worth checking out at the theaters . 
wow !  so much fun !  probably a bit much for normal american kids ,  and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film ,  this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits - very terry gilliam all the way through .  while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward ,  miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel-esquire moments .  the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid/hero ,  with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein .  and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike's work ,  the layers of meaning and metaphor ,  particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly ,  is pretty damn poignant .  as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films ,  only instead of over the top torture and gore ,  he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure .  f'n rad ,  and one of miike's best ! 
i had been looking forward to how to lose friends & alienate people for months ,  particularly due to the fact that kirsten dunst and simon pegg were starring .  simon pegg is a comedic genius and kirsten dunst has always been a favorite actress of mine .  how to lose friends & alienate people hit the spot !  of course not perfect ,  but very enjoyable and funny .  how to lose friends & alienate people follows the life of sidney young ,  a smalltime ,  bumbling ,  british celebrity journalist ,  who is hired by an upscale magazine in new york city .  in spectacular fashion sidney enters high society and burns bridges with bosses ,  peers and superstars .  after disrupting one black-tie event by allowing a wild pig to run rampant ,  sidney catches the attention of clayton harding ,  editor of sharp ,  and accepts a job with the magazine in new york city .  clayton warns sidney that he'd better impress and charm everyone he can ,  if he wants to succeed .  instead ,  sidney instantly insults and annoys fellow writer alison olsen  ( kirsten dunst )  .  he dares to target the star clients of power publicist eleanor johnson  ( gillian anderson )  .  he also upsets his direct boss lawrence maddox  ( danny huston )  .  sidney finds creative ways to annoy nearly everyone .  his saving grace ,  a rising starlet sophie maes  ( megan fox )  who develops an odd affection for him .  in time ,  allison's friendship might be the only thing saving sydney from his downward spiraling career .  the storyline is very interesting and the acting was top notch with what the actors were given .  simon pegg is still hilarious as ever !  he makes sydney bumbling ,  obnoxious ,  and annoying as real as it gets ,  but later in time making sydney not just likable ,  but also a real character who you root for in the end .  kirsten dunst and jeff bridges were brilliant !  kirsten had some very wonderful acting and hilarious scenes ,  and jeff bridges is just jeff f*cking bridges !  how can you not like him ?  !  he makes clayton a very humorous character with some wit and overall you just love the guy .  gillian anderson ,  megan fox ,  and danny huston were great as the supporting cast .  each had their own personality that were overall pretty unlikable ,  but that's what just made the film work .  one thing i didn't enjoy was how one dimensional some of the characters were .  i understand that most were the supporting cast ,  but some of the cast was underused and could've given the film some more spice to it .  how to lose friends & alienate people will never be on anyone's top 10 films ever ,  or even top 10 comedies ever ,  but it has a very high entertainment level and some scenes may even charm you as well .  how to lose friends & alienate people is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the year !  8/10
one of director miike takashi's very best .  it's so good it's difficult to put into words .  at nearly fifteen years older than the target audience it thrilled me from beginning to end .   it recalls similar children's films from the 1980s in the sense that  ( unlike today )  those films weren't afraid to scare - there's a lot of nasty detail here that i initially found jarring but soon realised it's nothing different to what i grew up on .  the film is a compilation of '80s kid's films conventions .  you name it ,  it's there :  a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappy/dysfunctional world into another ,  inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins ;  a quest to save both worlds from an evil force ;  a beautiful heroine he has a crush on ;  a sadistic henchwoman  ( go-go yubari from kill bill vol .  1 )  ;  a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to .  but all these genre conventions are given a fresh spin and added depth .   one of the imdb reviews begins  " where was this film when i was a kid ?  "  and it's a sentiment i agree with wholeheartedly .  even while watching it i lamented the fact that i hadn't grown up on it ;  that it wasn't a part of my childhood like labyrinth ,  masters of the universe and ,  to a much lesser extent ,  the neverending story .  those films ,  and others like the goonies are recalled but never copied - miike relentlessly offering us a new take on things .   poor cgi is a staple of many of his films ,  sometimes due to budgetary limitations but just as frequently an artistic choice - a desire to present things in an outlandish way .  here the cgi is mostly average ,  solely due to budgetary limitations ,  but nevertheless he does a fantastic job of putting on a spectacle .  the cg effects combine with traditional puppets ,  animatronics and truly extraordinary make-up to create a world filled with rich characters  ( and characterisation )  that frequently borders on the visionary .   this ranks as one of the greatest children's films ever made .  not for younger or more sensitive kids though .   just jaw-droppingly wonderful .  see it for yourselves and if you think your kids can handle/appreciate it then show it to them .  let them grow up on the great yokai war as some small compensation for the fact you couldn't . 
i was pleasantly surprised to find that how to lose friends and alienate people was nowhere near as 'gross-out' a comedy as the trailer had led me to expect .  i rapidly became absorbed in the unfolding of the narrative and remained engrossed throughout .  pacing of the more visual humorous content was ,  i thought ,  spot on .   ( i mean i got the impression i was witnessing pegg's attempts at restoring lost control very much 'in real time' ,  so to speak .  )  at other moments there was time allowed to share the main protagonists'  ( i . e .  pegg's and dunst's )  reflection on how events were affecting them and what had led them to where they now found themselves .  all the characters were well cast ,  to some extent interesting in and of themselves ,  and generally quite likable .   ( any apparent ruthless ambition displayed tended to be tempered by a corresponding good natured resilience .  )  an entertaining ,  intelligently scripted ,  brilliantly directed and superbly acted film that i would thoroughly recommend . 
this outstanding argentine independent film is one of the very best of the year 2000 from all south america ,  including argentina ,  which is producing an astonishing number of quality films since 1999 .  in 2000 alone ,  argentina released many quality films ,  which broke argentine b . o .  records .  a half dozen were internationally acclaimed ,  like this one ,  at important world film festivals .  after viewing this film ,  one can see how home grown argentinian films were able last year to recapture 20% of its national movie market .   directed by one of argentina's best directors ,  daniel burman ,  this film examines effects of globalisation worldwide ,  but emphasizes its impact on argentina ,  and particularly the jewish community of buenos aires .  daniel hendler is wonderful as the nice jewish boy ,  trying to survive and even succeed in today's business climate .  hector alterio ,  one of the great actors of hispanic cinema worldwide ,  is perfect as simon ,  the jewish father ,  as is the rest of the cast ,  which includes spanish and italian stars .   so many current themes in urban western societies are explored ,  i don't have enough space to go into detail .  daniel burman cleverly weaves them into the plot with different characters personifying diverse dilemmas .  if this film plays at a festival near you ,  or on video ,  don't miss it ! 
we first watched this film as part of a festival of new argentine films in 2000 at the walter reade .  although we liked it ,  we didn't think it was extraordinary .  watching it for a second time ,  we found a different meaning in this look at life in buenos aires .   the film takes place in one of the darkest days of argentina ,  as the delarua administration was ending .  the country was in turmoil after the economy ,  which had flourished earlier in the 1990s ,  under the artificially climate president menen created .  it was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got themselves living a nightmare .   the story begins just as santamarina ,  a bank employee ,  is fired because the collapse of the economy .  instead of receiving sympathy from his wife ,  she locks him out of the apartment and he ,  for all practical purposes ,  becomes a homeless man .  he takes to the streets trying to make ends meet .   the other story introduces us to ariel ,  a young jew ,  interviewing for a job in a spanish company .  it's almost a miracle he gets the job .  his father ,  simon ,  owns a small restaurant in the jewish quarter of  " el once "  in the center of the city .  things go from bad to worse ,  when ariel's mother dies suddenly .  only estela ,  the young woman who is in love with ariel ,  comes to help father and son .   santamarina ,  who is a clean man ,  has to resort to take showers wherever he can .  he chooses a ladies' room in one of the subway stations .  when the attendant ,  elsa ,  finds him naked ,  she becomes furious ,  but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times .  they become romantically involved ,  and santamarina in one of his trips through the street garbage ,  finds an infant .  elsa ,  while surprised ,  wants to do the right thing .  but santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will cement their love .   ariel ,  who has met the gorgeous laura at work ,  begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co-worker ,  who unknown to him ,  is involved in a lesbian affair .  ariel who free lances by photographing weddings and other occasions ,  feels a passion for laura ,  but he realizes what estela has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves him .   daniel burman ,  whose  " el abrazo partido "  we thought was excellent ,  did wonders with this film .  things are put in its proper perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having perceived it the first time around .  if anything ,  this second time ,  the nuances of the screen play mr .  burman and emiliano torres wrote ,  make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark days .   daniel hendler ,  who plays ariel ,  has collaborated with mr .  burman before to surprising results .  he is not 'movie star pretty' ,  yet ,  he is handsome .  this actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work .  enrique pineyro is another magnificent surprise .  his santamarina is disarming .  in spite of all the bad things that have fallen on him ,  he keeps a rosy attitude toward everyone he meets .  stefania sandrelli ,  the interesting italian actress ,  makes a great contribution to the film with her elsa .  hector alterio ,  one of the best argentine actors plays the small part of simon .  the gorgeous chiara coselli is seen as laura and melina petrielli appears as the noble estela .    " esperando al mesias "  proves daniel burman is a voice to be reckoned with in the argentine cinema . 
 " yes ,  georgio "  is a light-hearted and enjoyable movie/comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music .  it's not my favorite movie but it is a movie i have enjoyed seeing more than once .  some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy pavarotti ,  they would likely be better served by picking up an opera dvd .  although ,  a full opera might be a better representation of pavarotti's operatic talents ,  oftentimes ,  an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person .   " yes ,  georgio "  permits pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would not .   many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable ;  i don't agree .  enormously talented people can be both self-centered and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people .  additionally ,  people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own .  both georgio and pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other .   relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities .  the ending scenes from puccini's turandot alone are worth the time to get there . 
as someone else commented ,  this is a feel-good movie .  it's got glorious scenery and the wonder-filled voice of luciano !  i've seen this movie many times and just saw it again this afternoon .  i'd forgotten how much i miss pavarotti's singing of nessun dorma and i need to get out the cd !  it's a great movie to just while away the afternoon engrossed in fun and reverie .  eddie albert is grand as the agent and a bit over the top ,  but all agents are just that anyway .  the italian countryside is gorgeous but nothing tops the balloon ride for the perfect view .  if you need acting of olivier proportion ,  this movie isn't for you .  if you just want a flight of fancy and some wonderful music ,  watch this film .  just enjoy ! 
okay ,  let's face it .  this is a god-awful movie .  the plot  ( such as it is )  is horrible ,  the acting worse .  but the movie was made for one reason and one reason only ,  like all of those awful mario lanza movies .  .  . just to hear the voice of the star ,  in this case pavarotti in his prime .  okay ,  so maybe the lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women ,  but this movie is about hearing luciano .  that alone is worth watching the movie .  a big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears ,  finds humility and love along the way ,  and belts out a lot of hit numbers ,  too .   i must admit i'm prejudiced on a number of levels .  i'm italian .  i'm a big pavarotti fan  ( is there anything about pavarotti that isn't big ,  including his fan base ?  )  .  and when i first saw this movie i was going out on my own ,  seeing the height and depth of life's possibilities and in love for the first time .  so as awful as this movie is ,  the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love again .   yes ,  it's corny and awful .  but the voice is immortal and timeless ,  and the voice is what it's all about .  so i give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love ,  especially since he is now gone .  like italian food that you've never tried before ,  try it !  you may be pleasantly surprised ,  as a luciano lover or prospective pavarotti peep . 
i remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 & loved it then .  about 4 years later i had the privilege of seeing luciano pavarotti sing at the metropolitan opera house in new york  ( in tosca )  so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night .  what's not to like about this film ?  the music is brilliant and pavarotti  ( fini )  was at his best and still looked great .  the story is actually very funny in parts & the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest i have ever seen .  the hot air balloon flight over the napa valley was beautiful & so was the song he sang  " if we were in love "   ( one of the few times pavarotti sang in english )  .  and hearing the duet of santa lucia gorgeous .  get real folks ,  this was a film about an opera singer called georgio fini who just happened to be played by pavarotti .  kathryn harrold & eddie albert were excellent in their supporting roles .   i am very glad that i still have this almost worn out vhs tape of this movie but i would love this to be released on dvd especially now that pavarotti is no longer with us because i think this includes the best performance of nessun dorma sung by him still on film today ! 
i saw this movie when it came out when i was 17 years old and into classic rock  ( still am )  .  .  .    i never liked opera before because i hate soprano voices ,  but he changed all that .  he was adorable in the movie and had such an amazing voice .    i heard on cnn that he died tonight at home of pancreatic cancer ,  he will be missed ,  and he definitely left his mark on this world .   i hope to buy this movie if i can find it ,  watch and enjoy .  *smile* maybe i should head over to amazon . com and have a look before it's sold out . 
i watched this movie with my mother when i was in high school many years ago .  i definitely was not the least bit interested in opera at the time ,  but he changed my views .  i enjoyed this movie very much and have truly enjoyed opera ever since .  i even bought several of his cd's .  who cares what his acting abilities were ,  he basically just played himself ,  which was adorable .  he was so charming ,  so charismatic ;  i honestly just wanted to hug him .  i feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly .  it was so straight ,  did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions .  he deserves to be respected and admired for his talent .  he will definitely be missed !  !  ! 
yes ,  giorgio ,  is a feel good movie .  a little romance ,  great music ,  beautiful scenery ,  comedy ,   ( a great food fight )  ,  and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of yes ,  giorgio .  any movie buff would enjoy this film .  those who require massive special effects ,  should look elsewhere .  most of us need a little escape now and then ,  and how better to do this ,  than with a feast for the eyes ,  ears ,  and heart ?  a must see ! 
once upon a time ,  there were different types of movies .  these different movies coexisted even though each one had something different to offer .  .  .  .   this seems obvious at first ,  but i thought i'd point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten .  this is just a fun movie for pavarotti fans .  that's all it is .  it doesn't claim to be anything else or anything grander .  people who deride it as something that fell short of a promise aren't seeing the whole picture- literally .  after all ,  hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people  ( bodyguard or the preacher's wife w/whitney houston are 2 examples that spring to mind .  )   first i'd like to address the movie as a vehicle for pavarotti .  there are worse things in this world-- and worse movies .  the singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun .  the movie starts with schubert's ave maria and then leoncavallo's matinatta .  pav sings arias from la gioconda ,  manon lescaut ,  and turandot but also sings popular music such as  " i left my heart in san francisco "  and the song that was nominated for an oscar & golden globe ,   " if we were in love "  w/music by john williams & lyrics by alan & marilyn bergman- all 3 previous oscar winners .   the story isn't that bad .  it was built for pavarotti so of course it's not going to be something that's profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer .  it's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago .  when asked to sing again at the same place ,  the  " met "  in nyc ,  he loses his voice from fear .  doctor pamela  ( or pah-may-lah in italian :  )  )  played by kathryn harrold- gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction .  he offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly accepts .   they embark on an affair ,  she knowing he's married & promising not to fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman .  despite all that ,  they fall in love  ( thus the song ,   " if we were in love "  )  and with her help ,  he overcomes his fear & goes back to the met where he triumphs .  i won't tell how it ends ,  but it's fairly predictable .  which isn't always a bad thing .    the performances in this aren't that bad .  pavarotti  ( who plays giorgio fini )  isn't an actor ,  so if you're expecting a spencer tracy or tom hanks performance ,  you are deluded ,  not pavarotti .  he knows he's not a thespian .  what he is is cute ,  charming & charismatic .  he is having fun himself ,  and if you can just let yourself have fun too ,  it's not so bad .  one funny line is when he tells pamela  ( harrold )  that she's a  " thirsty plant ,  fini can water you !  "  and of course ,  she says ,   " i don't want to be watered on by fini !  "  kathryn harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semi-uptight woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little .  one of my favorite lines in the movie is :   " life never has to be life size .  "  and there's eddie albert who does his usual good job as fini's manager .  there are several  " themselves "  cameos by real conductors ,  singers ,  etc .  and it is filmed on location at the metropolitan opera at lincoln center .    if you like opera ,  if you like pavarotti ,  or if you can just let yourself go & enjoy a  " little fling "  just like he proposes in the movie- then you can enjoy this movie for what it is .  i know i do- every time .   :  )   
i vaugely recall seeing this when i was 3 years old ,  then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon .  then i was about 8 or 9 years old when i rediscovered it and since i was then able to comprehend things better ,  i thought it was a good movie then .  fast forward to just a few weeks ago  ( june 2006 )  when i re-re discovered it thanks to some internet articles/video clips and it's just not the same movie .  i'm sure it's still good with the kids ,  but to us 20-30 somethings it's definitely got  " cult status "  written all over it .  it's a shame that the original production went through a painful process ;  if fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today .  maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be ,  but that's for fox to decide .  i'm rambling here ,  i know .  i still think it's a great film ,  but it could be better than great . 
 .  .  . in our household .  like everyone else who has commented on this movie ,  my brothers  ( 7 & 4 years old at the time )  and i  ( 10 )  would watch this movie over and over again .  we all loved star wars ,  but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure .  we all loved the camel and would sing at the top of our lungs with him during his song .  there are some slow moments  ( the time spent with king koo-koo in his court )  and we generally got bored after the knight's song  (  " the reason that i {sound effect} is because i loooooove you "  )  ,  but we loved the journey to rescue babbette and the ending and were all a little freaked out by the picture of king koo-koo floating there dominating the entire horizon ,  laughing maniacally at the end .  i still to this day sing  " hooray for me !  babbette of gay paris !  "  around my friends  ( i'm 33 now )  who just look at me as if i've lost my mind ;  however ,  when i'm singing it i'm 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of star wars . 
this raggedy ann and andy movie is so adorable .  we love watching ann and andy sing and dance ,  along with the camel with the wrinkled knees .  this movie is what made the camel with the wrinkled knees so popular ,  singing his song ,   " i'm nobodies i love you "  .  if you love raggedy ann and andy watch the movie and you will see why it's a movie the kids love ,  and adults ! 
the last time i saw the movie i was around seven years ,  so my opinions might be jaded over time .  at the time i enjoyed the filming that switched between cartoon and live action .  at the time i felt sad for the blue camel and his sad life .  also i felt glee when after captain contagious kidnapped the heroine  ( a princess or toy shepherdess )  the tables the were turned on him .  unfortunately the producers never decided to transfer this movie to vhs ,  so all i have are twenty year old memories .  i am sure that if i saw the movie again i would consider it corny and sappy ,  but i really enjoyed it the movie at the time . 
never when i was a child did i love any movie more then this one .  i would love to own it .  i watched it every sunday they played it on the family film festival .  it is an enjoyable film suitable for the whole family and the songs are wonderful . 
richard willaims is an animation god .  he was hampered in directing this film by the producer .  the final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story ,  but some amazing moments of animation  ( like emery hawkins'  " greedy "  )  .  joe raposo's repetitive music doesn't help either .  it was made in wide screen so the vhs doesn't show it in all it's glory ,  let's hope for a letterboxed dvd someday .  still it's worth watching for some eye popping animation . 
personally ,  this is one of my favorites of all time !  no ,  i'm not 10 .  .  i'm 30 !  i own an old ,  original vhs of this that i bought from a rental store .  i've watched it countless times .  .   while it's an amusing movie for kids ,  it's an intriguing movie for adults .  i once saw this movie whiile i was .  .  not sober .  my eyes were opened to things i had never noticed before .  i saw morals being strongly encouraged ,  both overtly and somewhat subliminally .  .  i wish i could remember all the things i noticed in particular ,  but it's been a very long time since then .  rest assured ,  there are tons of things that are alluded to throughout the movie .  if you get the chance to view it .  .  not sober .  .  do so ,  you won't be disappointed .  .  as a matter of fact ,  you will probably feel rather happy and warm .   unique and wonderful ! 
i believe i received this film when i was a young buck .  i remembered watching it as a child ,  but i could never find the film .  i remembered good ol rageddy ann ,  andy ,  babette ,  the greedy ,  king koo koo .  i searched high and low for this movie and still no luck .  but one day when i was moving out of my childhood home i had found it .  we were reunited .  i am 17 years old now .  i still watch it .  all the time actually .  it's one of the funniest and touching movies i have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time .  and personally i think they should make a sequel .  mmm ,  yes a sequel indeed .  now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body ! 
also known as the big spook war .  the great yokai war is miike's attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well .  the problem is that i can't imagine many parents wanting to subject their children to this movie .  the best kids movies are the ones that are scary or have mildly disturbing imagery ,  neverending story and return to oz spring to mind ,  but in the case of the great yokai war miike probably takes things a little too far .  in fact at the screening i was at the person introducing the movie reiterated to the two families there that it was probably not very suitable .   the film kicks off with the young hero of the piece introducing himself and explaining about his current family problems .  this brief moment of mundanity is sharply broken as a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human whom screams that something horrendous is coming before falling dead like the abomination it is  ( it is quite possible that the sheer hideousness of the creature is some bizarre quato homage )  .   following an incredible introduction for main baddie kato ,  and his henchwoman agi  ( a surprisingly attractive chiaki kuriyami )  ,  by way of an apocalyptic army raising .  the story reverts to normal for a while ,  but it doesn't take long before any and all logic goes down the drain and the young boy teams up with a group of miyazaki rejects to take out the evil sorcerer .   the plot of the movie is fairly basic and surprisingly hackneyed at times ,  the entire chosen one just seems completely out of place in a movie which so regularly breaks clichés ,  but is aided by a simple awe inspiring vision of a magical world .  this really is a miyazaki movie made into a live action movie ,  albeit a much seedier and more vicious than usual miyazaki movie .   the film is simply a joy to look at the designs of the yokai is colourful ,  and largely practical ,  while the evil robotic monstrosities while not displaying the best cgi in the world have a practicality and menace to them which gives them far more of a palpable threat than you would imagine .   the cast is uniformly excellent ,  they just make their characters seem perfectly natural which is commendable when you consider that most of them are in full body makeup or latex suits .  even agi lumbered with a ridiculous beehive comes across as sultry and deadly thanks to surprisingly excellent acting from kuriyami .   while the film does have many elements which put it firmly into family movie territory ;  cute creatures ,  junior heroes ,  a thoroughly evil villain ,  a sense of mischief and adventure ,  and a telling lack of violence .  there are elements which make you question whether miike should have directed such a movie .   the robot army is a genuinely terrifying menace everyday items warped into monstrous beasts that look like t-101 sans skin and with added chainsaws .  these beasts rip characters to pieces ;  suck creatures into their blood stained mouths ,  and abduct children from their homes by swiping them right from under their parent's nose before indulging in a little patricide .   the creation of the creature is equally arduous for young minds .  the yokai ,  essentially the heroes ,  are feed into a giant furnace full of a liquidised form of hate which corrodes the yokai's flesh and forces their angry souls to possess lumps of metal .  if kids thought smouldering anakin was bad wait til they see a man sized hedgehog burning to death in a vat of molten hatred for a minute before being turned into an abomination of a motorcycle .  there is also limb severing ,  in one case a severed hand twitches in front of the camera dripping with blood ,  a fair amount of sexual energy  ( agi wears one dress designed specifically for fan service and seems to only have sleeping with kato as motivation ,  while the princess of the rivers wears next to nothing and gets her thighs groped by the young hero in several scenes )  ,  and general humour which will go right over the heads of those that this technicolour wonder was seemingly designed for .   spoilers an example of this being that the yokai only become interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party .  the subsequent battle more of a festival than anything ,  complete with beer ,  crowd surfing and moshing .  also a scene where agi beats the tar out of a cute furry creature seems designed to appeal to the masses jaded by pokemon overkill .   end spoilers at the end of the day the great yokai war is easily on of miike's stronger recent films .  while it lacks some of the perverse charm of say gozu or ichi it is just continually pushing the audience down a road of general insanity .  in fact this is easily miike's most deranged movie in that he embraces the sheer magic of the subject so wholeheartedly .   well worth a watch just for the occasional flash of gogo arse . 
i have very fond memories of this film ,  as i saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown theatrically in 1977 and i was eight years old .  apparently it was deemed a failure - and is now practically forgotten  ( the pan-and scan videocassette - which never did justice to the picture or it's ambitious panavision compositions is now out-of -print .  )  the film is very stylized  ( shades of yellow submarine )  and admittedly uneven .  some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and undistinguished .  the sad discarded blue camel  ( shades of eeyore )  and his blue song are truly heartwarming .  joe raposo's songs are for the most part simply beautiful .  definitely a worthwhile curiousity that will probably  ( sadly )  fall into total obscurity . 
now here's a film straight out of my childhood ,  my family used to taped ;  but it kind of got tapped over and losted over the years .  now i was fortunate to watch the whole film on youtube . com ;  i had love this wonderful film when i watched it as kid ,  and after watching again  ( online )  ,  i still do today .  my favorite song from the movie is  " candy hearts and paper flowers "   ( i will always remember that sweet song forever )  .    i was surprised when i looked at the opening credits  ( on who animated who )  , that some of the animators date back to 1930s  ( wow !  that's like 47 years )  . 
this is a very strange film by director/animator richard williams .  all who know of william's work know it's a bit off-kilter  ( if not ingenious )  but this one takes the cake .   it features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner's new french doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way .  the strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality ;  its strange character designs ,  its powerful animation ,  and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary .  williams' brilliant animation portrayed raggedy ann and andy as real rag dolls ,  floppy and darned ,  rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls ,  which made it more believable  ( at least in a visual sense )  .  the animation shines on the bring us the camel-with-the-wrinkled-knees ,  whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end ,  the silent-movie chase with sir leonard looney and ,  of course ,  the greedy .   the greedy animation ,  on its own ,  is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation i've ever seen .  there's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop--and every second it's something new .  living in what was deemed  " the taffy pit ,  "  the greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets .  he sings a song that i can't help but feel hold some sexual undertones ,  then tries to kill raggedy ann for her candy heart .   the only complaint i have about this film is that there are too many songs .  it continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are sixteen of them .  there are about six good songs  ( which should have been the only ones )  including  " i look ,  and what do i see ?  "  ,   " no girl's toy "  ,   " blue "   ( though they didn't need to make him sing it twice )  ,   " i never get enough "  ,   " because i love you "  and maybe  " i'm home .  "  the others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren't too amazing to listen to .   this is a weird film with strange undertones ,  but if that's what you're looking for ,  you won't find better . 
raggedy ann & andy is the first movie i ever saw in the theaters .  my dad took my sister and i ,  and the funny thing is - when we got home ,  dad asked us  " what do you want to do now ?  "  and we said we want to watch raggedy ann & andy again !  lol ,  and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how i remember it .  i was five years old at the time .   this movie was pretty scary for a five year old .  the scene with the giant ocean of sweets ,  and the hypnotic camel scene .  .  i don't remember a lot from this film ,  naturally ,  the beginning was magical ,  and a few scenes -- i wish i could find it again ,  and will likely seek it out now .   i remember i loved raggedy ann & andy . 
i saw this movie at the theaters when i was about 6 or 7 years old .  i loved it then ,  and have recently come to own a vhs version .    my 4 and 6 year old children love this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it .    i have enjoyed watching it again too .  though i have to admit it is not as good on a little tv .   i do not have older children so i do not know what they would think of it .    the songs are very cute .  my daughter keeps singing them over and over .   hope this helps . 
i saw this jolly little film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on cbs .  i didn't know it had been in a theater at all .  to rate it from a kids point of view i'd give it 4 out of 5 stars , because being a young boy at the time , it seemed a little  " girlish "  .   the climactic scene where gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing .    when i re-discovered it a blockbuster video in 1995 , i had to revisit it !  i still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit  " old "  .  i don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on vhs .   it's out there .  might even be on dvd by now , at least i hope it is .  i want to share it with my kids someday !  10 stars on here , it's still a great kids film .   ( end )   09/08/2009  :  finally found a vhs copy !  !  woo-hoo ! 
raggedy ann and raggedy andy the movie is about dolls that come to life when the humans aren't around .  in this adventure they must rescue a kidnapped french doll named babette from the captain of pirates .  on their way they journey though deep dark woods ,  taffy pit ,  and even looney land .  will the aide of their new friend the camel with wrinkled knees help them or just slow them down with his hallucinations of his friends leaving him ?  how will they escape the kookoo king and his henchmen !  ?  what will their owner marcella say when she sees her 7th birthday present doll gone along with her other toys ?  delightful surprises await the two adventurers .   all scores are out of a possible 10 :  story :  8 - very cute .  dolls that come to life when the master isn't around .  not just that because they go out into many many different places ,  but they are in an imaginary world so anything can happen .  meeting new characters ,  going to different places finding new friends ,  its great .  the characters all work so well in this too and who doesn't love pirates ?  !  acting :  8 - every character suits their voice so well .  specifically the marlon brando taffy pit enemy ,  the greed .  the french doll has a very uptight french accent ,  the evil hitler-esquire king kookoo  ( whos got hair that resembles simpson's sideshow bob )  plays his role very well ,  and the sorrow old black man voice for camel works perfectly .  why is it that old dubbed animation was soo much better than new ones ?  music :  10 - nothing short of perfection here .  the songs have been in my head for years ,  and re-watching it nearly 20 years later ,  i can still remember each and every one of them and will now be able to know exactly where these tunes come from .  joe raposo of  " sesame street "  fame did an excellent job with the songs for this and everyone sings real well .   editing :  6 - heh ,  this is where it'll get confusing .  i mean how far did the raggedy's walk anyway ?  a lot of events just seem to occur one after another and there's no telling who the other dolls and toys were as you never see them in the real world of the movie ,  but it does follow some sort of path and you know they'll eventually get to where they need to go ,  its just pretty hard to follow at times .   uniqueness :  8 - between this and unico i'd have to say there's parts in both movies i will never forget no matter how hard i try to .  mainly the scary parts .  i've probably mentioned already how older movies were much creepier than animation of today but this takes the cake in the scary factor .  outside of the south park movie and some disney films there's almost no animated musicals ,  or good ones of that coming out so its very unique .   worth :  8- its classic .  worth the hunt to get a good copy thats for sure ,  but the vhs copies are probably all stretched out by now .  the dvd version is sold on ebay all the time and it'll definitely be something you'll watch more than once .  if anything get it for the nostalgia purposes .   overall score  ( not an average )  :  8 - its a wonderful timeless musical made in the late 70s and can still be enjoyed today .  its characters are all unique and the songs are great .  so great you might find yourself humming them time and time again .  give your favorite stuffed animal a hug today !  reviewer's insight  ( including bias )  :  this isn't like the raggedy ann tv series made a decade later .  this was way more darker and real world .  the effects in this seem like a lot of other acid-trip cartoons from the 70's ,  in particular ,  yellow submarine .  still ,  its given me memories i'll never forget ,  and might still influence things today .  it wasn't easy to find but it'll remain a treasure to keep in my collection of dvds and videos forever . 
oh ,  boy ,  god bless the 1970's ,  we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade :  the exorcist ,  jaws ,  the texas chainsaw massacre ,  halloween and now ,  raggedy ann & andy :  a musical adventure .  this movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world ,  i mean seriously ,  this movie scared the heck out of me .  my sister had this movie in her vhs collection and i was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money .  what the heck ?  it's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970's version of toy story ,  pretty much down to a key ,  only this was a thousand times scarier ,  disney had alice in wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children .   whenever marcella leaves the room ,  raggedy ann ,  along with her brother raggedy andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life .  on marcella's birthday ,  a new doll ,  babette ,  arrives from paris ,  france to the united states of america .  babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll ,  but the friendly raggedy ann does everything she can to make babette feel at home .  however ,  the pirate captain contagious kidnaps her .  raggedy ann and andy set off to try to rescue her before marcella discovers babette is gone .  out in the world outside the nursery ,  the two meet the camel with the wrinkled knees ,  a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely .  after raggedy ann and andy hitch a ride on the camel ,  he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking ,  runs over the edge of a cliff ,  into a deep pit .  in this pit they encounter the greedy ,  who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full .  the raggedys and the camel narrowly escape being consumed by the greedy and continue their journey to find babette and believe me ,  it just gets weirder from this point on .   while this movie was certainly disturbing and i just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie ,  this was actually pretty creative .  back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it ,  you can tell that they did that with raggedy ann & andy :  a musical adventure .  this certainly wasn't the worst movie i have ever seen ,  i just don't know who to recommend it too .  as scared as i was ,  i have to admit i'm glad i watched it ,  sometimes you need a  " wtf ?  !  "  movie to spice up your selection ,  believe me when i say that raggedy ann had no problem in doing just that with me .  it's official ,  that doll is just plain creepy ,  let's just put it this way ,  there's a giant caramel river that is eating everything ,  a king who's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs ,  a bizarre thing that humiliates raggedy ann and her brother ,  a strange almost incest between ann and andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs .  yikes .   7/10
this is the best piece of film ever created its a master piece that brought a tear to my eye .  ill never forget my experience watching it .  i don't understand why people don't think as i do the dinosaur turns in a performance reminiscent of de niro in raging bull ,  pacino in scarface ,  and crowe in gladiator combined .  this should be released on dvd in superbit format so i can fully enjoy it like it was meant to be enjoyed when they produced and filmed it .  whoppi goldberg truly turns in the performance of a lifetime as a tough ,  gritty cop who is against her will teamed with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner then the hi-jinx ensues to say the least .  by the way i'm saying the complete opposite of what is true this movie is utter garbage . 
takashi miike's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements .  this is a fairy tale that dares to be dark .  even as a kid ,  i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales ;  horrible things happen to people in most children's books .  miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier  ( and more disturbing )  than what they appear to be at first glance .  the filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom .  he accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions .  westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids .  i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers .  he goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain .  but a self-possessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers .  i thought it was a great film .  highly recommended . 
i enjoyed it .  in general ,  i'm not a fan of comedies and comedians ,  but i do like whoopi .  i'm also partial to sci/fi fantasy .  and the dinosaur craze .  i read for pleasure ,  but when i'm feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead ,  i watch tv & movies to escape .  theodore rex enabled me to do so .  that makes it a success in my eyes !  i didn't even walk away to do something else while it was running .  whether or not it was rated as  " good "  or not doesn't really matter to me .  and no ,  i'm not a juvenile .  nor am i a moron . 
this movie is excellent and i would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it .  or ,  even better ,  you could buy it because chances are you're going to watch this over and over .  i can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then .  but after watching it again yesterday i've found it to be amazing .   a good blend of comedy  ( although not as great as  " mr magoo " -another one of my favorites )  and action .  this deserves 10/10 and i'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon  ( fingers crossed )  .  if you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then i'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours  :  )  . 
compelling and innovative !  at the beginning of this criminally underrated whoopi goldberg flick the writers draw a parallel between theodore rex and the 1941 orson welles classic  " citizen kane "  .  the writers are justified in drawing such a seemingly disparate parallel ,  but the viewing public is too often hoodwinked into seeing overly hyped hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two movies .  in  " citizen kane "  charles foster kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his underlings ,  much like whoopi goldberg in this movie .  this movie is about finding love in everybody's differences .  it is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self-absorption .  whoever paired whoopi goldberg and theodore rex formulated a dyad for the ages ,  with the only justifiable comparisons being bogey and bacall ,  hepburn and tracy and hall and oates .  if you would love to watch an uplifting ,  celluloid philosophical examination of some of humanity's deepest drives ;  bergman-esqe but not as depressing ,  theodore rex should be viewed immediately ! 
theodore rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time ,  and is certainly a milestone in human culture ,  civilization and artistic expression !  !  in this compelling intellectual masterpiece ,  jonathan r .  betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century ,  such as francis ford copola ,  martin scorcese ,  orson welles and roman polanski .  the special effects are nothing less than breathtaking ,  and make any work by spielberg look trite and elementary .  at the time of it's release ,  theodore rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film-making to levels never anticipated by film makers .  the concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur ,  but adapting an action packed ,  thrilling detective novel ,  co-staring a  " talking "  dinosaur with a post-modern name such as  " theodore "  ,  and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it .  the world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty .  watching theodore rex is much akin to looking into the face of god and hearing him say  " you are my most beloved creation .  "  this is one of the few films that is simply to die for !  !  ! 
the plot is real horrific ,  the atmosphere really depressive ,  unusual for a low-budget production like that ,  and at least ,  for a german production .  a little bit of indian spirituality ,  mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together .  the development of plot and characters are great ,  the sets very close to reality ,  without any studio-atmosphere .  it could be perfect ,  but at unfortunately some things were a little bit disappointing ,  what don't inevitably have to be typically for low-budget movies :   1 .  )  the cast sometimes is not more than average .  almost every actor look like a layman .  some of them do a good ,  or a very good job ,  but some are acting like the actors of crappy german court-shows !  but i was very ,  very disappointed of the acting of mathieu carrière !  his acting  (  in a lots of of his older movies his acting was fine  )  here was below-average !  but that could be the reason ,  why he today takes part in crappy german soaps or tv-series on private channels .   2 .  )  the dialogs are sometimes on soap-opera-level .    3 .  )  the bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand ,  what the characters are saying .  i saw it on dvd and was glad to could rewind and to listen it again .  it caused by the set  (  big halls as in the hospital or with the esoterically group  )  and sometimes the strange dialects of the actors !   but all in all ,  it is an interesting movie ,  worth to watch it ,  far beyond the commercially movies ,  which are often more terrible . 
this movie has its ups and downs ,  but to me the good stuff in this movie very much outweighs the bads .  .  .   what's not so good about the movie are indeed sometimes the dialogue ,  the sounds ,  the lighting ( am i the only one who noticed the way the sets were lighted was amateur ,  and the acting .  .  .  .   what is very good are the highly original storyline ,  the very intense atmosphere ,  the gore factor which is very high ,  and the effects which are done supremely .   so ,  definitely worth watching ,  or maybe even a must-see for all you horror and gore fans .  .  .  . 
tears of kali is an original yet flawed horror film that delves into the doings of a cult group in india comprised of german psychologists who have learned how to control their wills and their bodies to the point that they can cause others to be  " healed "  through radical techniques  ( that can trigger nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture )  to release the pent-up demons inside them .   the film is shown as a series of vignettes about the taylor-eriksson group--the above-mentioned cult group .  the first segment is somewhat slower than the rest but serves fine to set up the premise for the rest of the film .  the rest of it plays out like a mindf@ck film with some of the key staples thrown in the mix  ( full-frontal nudity ,  some gore )  to keep you happy .   i say check this out .  may not be spectacular ,  but it's concept is pretty neato and it delivers in the right spots .  8/10 . 
its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one ,  but for me tears of kali is one of the horror highlights of the 00's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece .  an anthology horror ,  it takes on the story of the fictional taylor-eriksson group ,  a cult of sorts based in india whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche ,  with unpleasant results that echo down the years .  with bookend segments set in india the film is made chiefly of three stories set in germany ,  illustrating the aftermath of the work of the taylor-eriksson group ,  with some pretty nasty gore at times .  its an interesting set up as these things go ,  but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror .  bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients ,  healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals ,  dark forces unbound by time ,  place or even personality .  good examples of this are found in the first story especially ,  dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital .  previous to this story we have seen lars eriksson and notably his wonky  ( lazy ?  )  eye ,  we also see him healing or at least comforting a patient .  the lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as eriksson healing a fellow patient ,  also as she wraps up the canvases from the art class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen ,  a face with lazy eye like erikssons .  there are also references to folk in minuscule roles ,  extras and walk ons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film ,  showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and able to almost infect others .  there is more to the film philosophically than just evil within ,  it is a film about death ,  suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect  ( at least from the research that i did on wikipedia )  .  writer/director andreas marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in constructing the film .  as well as being thoughtful ,  the film is pretty chilling too ,  the soundtrack of bharti india and panama john has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances ,  michael balaun as a sinister doctor and cora chilcot as a freaky patient especially good .  the third story also has a fine turn from veteran mathieu carrière as a faith healer .  the biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well .  so ,  the film isn't quite as gripping as it might be ,  the acting occasionally off and the pacing too ,  but mostly i thought it was pretty great ,  if a shade short of its possible brilliance .  well worth a look for adventurous horror fans i think . 
one of the best low budget movies from germany !  is this is the dark side of new age ?  if you believe in esoteric ,  please don't watch this movie !  it blows all your positive fantasies away .  this movie shows that beyond the peaceful façade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror .  i hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon !  andreas marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area ,  making movies with a few euros !  i'm waiting for the second hit ! 
this is a trio of tales ,   " shakti "  ,   " devi "  ,  and  " kali "  ,  about an experimental commune  ( or some such thing )  called the taylor-eriksson group ,  which took people on journeys inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown ,  and left a bit of damage here and there ,  i'd say .  many years later some of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself .  shakti tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously ,  in fact ,  he was torn apart ,  and the suspect was a man that may not have existed .  seems this woman is able to project some inner demon ,  or so finds out the sister of the man who was killed when she attempts to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter .  devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to  " jump out of his skin "  .  he's a skinhead ,  a speed freak ,  and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this commune ,  which results in the good doctor helping the young man to realize his desire .  this is probably the best of the three segments .  kali tells the tale of a healer ,  who attempts to  " heal "  this woman who was a part of this commune and lets loose some kind of demon that has lived in this woman ,  but one wonders if he did it or if she loosed it because it could not survive in her any longer .  all three of these tales are pretty creepy and suspenseful because you're never really sure what to expect ,  and the premise and the settings are so unlike those of conventional horror films that it adds to the strangeness .  this has a sort of low-budget look and feel to it but it also manages to conjure up a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout ,  much to its credit .  i watched this with my mouth hanging open a good portion of the time and when the real scares  ( and gore )  came it hit pretty hard .  i found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and liked it a lot .  a good little find ,  this one ,  i'd give it 8 out of 10 . 
where was this film when i was a kid ?  after his parents split up tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather .  tadashi's sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone .  grandfather is only  " here "  every third day .  moms never really home .  the kids always are picking on the poor kid .  during a village festival tadashi is chosen the  " kirin rider "  or spiritual champion of the peace and justice .  little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world .   okay that was the easy part .  now comes the hard part ,  trying to explain the film .   this is a great kids film .  no this is a great film , flawed ,   ( very flawed ?  )  but a great film none the less .  it unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero .  watching it i felt i was reading a great book ,  and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book .  i loved that the film does not follow a normal path .  things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication ,  one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep .  there are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it  ( which is typical miike )  certainly its a takashi miike film .  that japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching ,  scary and funny all at the same time .  no one except miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time ,  or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next .  i admire the fact that miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful ,  that doesn't shy away from being scary ,  i mean really scary ,  especially for kids .  this is the same dark territory that should be in the harry potter movies but rarely is .  this a dark grimms tale with humor .  my first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that i couldn't believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world ,  then i realized who was making the movie .  hats off to miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images .   its also operating on more than one level .  the mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind's discarded junk .  its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters . one of the yokai  ( spirits )  talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed .  you also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do .  its a wild concept ,  but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level .   ( there are a good many riffs and references to other movies , tv shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them ,  though many parents will )  and of course there are the monsters .  they run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between .  frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen .  its way cool and it works .  one of the main characters is a yokai which i think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal ,  it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on tadashi's head .   ( acceptance is also easier if you've ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird japanese monsters )  i mentioned flaws ,  and there are a few .  the effects are uneven ,  some of the sudden turns are a bit odd  ( even if understandable )  and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film .  .  none of them truly hurt the film over all ,  however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie .   i really loved this movie .  i'm pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time .   ( where's the english dub ?  )  . see this movie .  its a great trip .   ( besides its a good introduction to the films of miike minus the blood and graphic sex ) 
three horror stories based on members of a transgressive hindu cult that return home but changed in some way .  in the first story our former cult member is now in an insane asylum and is visited by a reported who wants to find out about what went on at the cult .  somewhat slow going as story is told in flashbacks while the two sit on chairs and face each other .  reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants .  what seemed rather boring suddenly turns very exciting with a surprising twist in the story .  things get quite bloody .   second story has a violent young criminal visiting a psychiatrist for mandatory therapy .  the patient seems to have some type of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task .  again ,  things slow down a bit and get weird .  then there's a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising .   final story deals with spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove the persons illness from them with his hands .  one of the patients is a former cult member ,  so the successful healing gets more complicated .  again ,  we are surprised by a twist .  has a pretty gory scene in there .   there some nice female full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason .  i found the stories to be very well written and the director succeeds entirely in setting up each story with its surprising twist and the gory aftermath .   note :  review of the german dvd . 
i saw this movie on the bifff festival in brussel ,  spring 2004 .  what a surprise !  this german production ,  a stylish and imaginative shocker ,  is one of the scariest flic i have seen .  be warned :  this is not a joke !  this terrorizer has a big cast of good actors  ( as an example : peter martell as a european guru has a strong presence )  ,  excellent direction ,  nice production design ,  a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx like italian horror movies in the eighties .  flesh ripped clean to the bone .  .  . and the blood runs red  .  .  . this savage heart stopper will grip you .  .  . and give you some dark dreams  .  .  .  a must-see !  ! 
i had initially heard of tears of kali a while back and it sounded like something i'd be into ,  but with all the films i have coming in on a regular basis ,  it kinda fell off my radar .  while roaming around the local wonderbook .  .  . i spotted the box for this one and grabbed it up .  i have to say i'm pretty glad i did .  tears of kali is a strange ,  gory ,  sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat constrained by it's obviously low budget - but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch .   tears of kali centers around the fictional india-based taylor-erikkson cult group ,  that practices meditation and other rituals in the pursuit of facing and banishing the individual's  " inner demons "  - but apparently these techniques work either all too well or not well enough  ( depending on your viewpoint .  .  .  )  as dark forces are not only exorcised ,  but also unleashed upon hapless victims .   the film is told  " anthology-style "  ,  with a short but memorable and  " eye-opening "  intro sequence ,  and then proceeding into the three stories that make up the bulk of the film .   the first  ( shakti )  is about a journalist who visits one of the cult-members who is being held at a mental hospital .  the journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the taylor-erikkson cult ,  but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home .  when the interview takes a violent turn ,  the journalist finds that she may have gotten in over her head .  .  .   the second part  ( devi )  concerns a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological rehab in lieu of a prison sentence for beating a young man into a coma .  we find that the treating doctor in question is actually a taylor-erikkson  " alumni "  ,  and his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm .  .  .   the closing story  ( kali )  revolves around a quack  " faith-healer "  and his assistant who perform  " miracles "  for a fee .  when the healer unwittingly helps one of his clients and actually expels a force which had been possessing her ,  the demon is now free to roam and looking for a new host .  .  .   i gotta say i really enjoyed tears of kali .  there are some faults with the film that keep it from being truly excellent - but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is .  my biggest gripe with the production is the poor and uninspired over-dubbed dialogue .  the dubbing is sub-par and i would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track .  some reviewers have said the acting is poor ,  which i don't necessarily agree with .  i think that the dubbing is so lack-luster that it makes the performances seem stunted ,  which isn't really the case .  in fact ,  a few of the performances are pretty damn chilling  ( the  " doctor "  in the second segment ,  and the  " client "  in the third readily come to mind .  .  .  )  and notable .  the gore fx are very well done for a low-budget film ,  with some graphic scenes of eyelid-removal-via-cuticle-scissors ,  a pencil-in-the-throat-suicide ,  some decent  ( but irritatingly  " shaky "  )  self-flaying ,  and a few other goodies thrown in for good measure .  not as rough as some of the more  " extreme "  gore films out there ,  but definitely stronger than your average horror fare .  i also found the story concerning the cult-group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horror-story nonsense .  there are plenty of scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension ,  the likes of which i haven't come across in a while .  although flawed in some fundamental ways ,  i still think tears of kali will appeal to most  " underground "  horror viewers - some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream viewer .  definitely recommended - 8 . 5/10
peaches is truly a marvelous film .  i write this to refute a review from someone called 'auscrit' ,  that has appeared on this site .  first of all the idea that either monahans first film 'the interview' is somehow tv is an extraordinary statement .  here is a film that has been significantly praised around the world as is simply one of the best australian films ever made .  it fully deserved to win best picture .  peaches is a brave ,  bold and courageous departure .  for me it works on every level and i have now seen it twice .  monahan is a filmmaker who is demonstrating great skill and incredible sensitivity .  for 'auscrit' to make the comment that it is another tv movie etc and that hugo weaving is no good simply does not 'get' the film .  or more particularly does not want to get it .  frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both .  or someone from inside the industry either distribution ,  exhibition or bureaucracy .  your average punter ,  i have found just does not write comments like that .  i have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film sommersault .  one has to wonder what people think they are looking at .  unfortunately in australia at the time ss was released the push was ,  if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you not the film .  this manipulation of the media is pretty common down under .  the reality is the only similarity between the two films are that they are rights of passage films .  unfortunately for me ss is a film about nothing ,  that could have been told in 15 minutes .  i see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety .  peaches in comparison is a master piece .  personally i cannot wait to what monahan does next as he is clearly way ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema .  in conclusion if the film does not win all at this years afi's and if awards ,  then it is a rigged game .  as for auscrit ,  please find something more constructive do with your time
how you could say that peaches ,  with its complex narrative dealing with a multitude of issues ,  is  " a small tv idea "  is beyond me .  besides i can think of many films that have  " a small tv idea "  in their plots .  your obvious dislike of the tv industry  (  "  sue smith has failed to rise above her television background "  )  is confusing .  particularly as you are having such  " a great time "  working in tv .  if only we could all be so talented as ms smith  ( no ,  i am not a friend or relative )  - afi award winning brides of christ ,  road from coorain , etc .  all made for tv .  come to think of it ,  what about those other  " small tv ideas "  like  " against the wind "  ,   " bodyline "  ,   " the dismissal "  ,   " scales of justice "  ,   " blue murder "  ,   " water under the bridge "   , etc .  i think peaches is a good entertaining film which had me interested ,  and most of my friends as well ,  from start to finish .  it is far from flawless yet i think it is among the best australian films i have seen over the last couple of years .  who knows ,  with a few more viewings  ( there's so much to think about )  ,  it might just be up there with classics like  " the year my voice broke "  ,   " the devil's playground "  .  i really did enjoy this film much more than  " somersault "  and  " three dollars "  .  these films ,  i think ,  had their moments-surreal ,  atmospheric ,  realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues ,  but as for sheer entertainment for mr . and mrs average movie goer and me ,  it was very ordinary if not boring .  when i go to a movie ,  i am always conscious of the audience's reaction to a film  ( through in- cinemas reactions and overheard conversations in the foyer and loo )  .  some came out of peaches shaking their heads ,  some with negative criticisms ,  but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience . 
sensitive film does lack brilliance and ,  to some degree ,  narrative structure ,  but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed .  however ,  the narrative structure point is debatable .  while it gives the impression of tying off loose ends nicely in the final scenes ,  and connects its thoughts with what might be described by the modern viewer as a  " story "  ,  i'm sceptical as to whether this feel *needs* a  " narrative structure "  that is definite and detectable .  inevitably ,  it will be compared with somersault in that its central protagonist  ( i'm not sure that's the correct word !  )  is a young ,  and very young-looking ,  woman ,  whose newly discovered sexuality both confuses and empowers her - although of course cate shortland's film tackles this aspect better .  but while the possibility exists for reckless viewers to dismiss this film as a cliché ,  peaches is ,  in some ways ,  much more ambitious than somersault .  perhaps that's where it doesn't quite make it .  it's certainly very different to monahan's first feature - the interview !  i'm not quite sure how the sex scenes between weaving and lung added to the story .  who knows - maybe they did .  they certainly rammed home the compromised and flawed nature of weaving's character - although i personally think this was achieved without the need for these scenes .   *****just saw the film again*********  on a second viewing ,  i can see how some would dismiss it as a telemovie dressed up as a feature .  but i'm not sure how distinct these 'categories' are anymore ,  or even if we should be making that distinction .  in any case ,  i do think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from hallmark efforts .  on the other hand ,  the film's structure is very formal ,  and its content is hardly challenging , at least in the way somersault ,  tom white ,  three dollars ,  the illustrated family doctor ,  look both ways and the human touch are .  the performances are all good ,  but i did come to the realisation that the main reason i was enjoying the film was because it fit the  " australian "  genre ,  without necessarily adding anything .  .  . and i can understand that this can be a fairly good reason for another person *not* to like it !  indeed ,  it wasn't until lung enters the room in her vietnamese dress that the film really begins to pack a punch .  but that leads us into another debate - *should* we expect that a film must challenge us all the time ?  certainly i enjoy being challenged by a film  ( or a book ,  or other people )  ,  but is there no room anymore for what is simply a nice story ?   i haven't deleted my initial post on this film ,  because i'm all too aware of the orwellian overtones of such an act .  but i would downgrade my initial rating from an 8 to perhaps a 6 . 5 .   as for nominations for afi best film ,  my votes go to the human touch ,  three dollars and look both ways - and i think look both ways should win . 
let me be the first non australian to comment on this  :  )  i got the movie for hugo weaving and i watched it to the end .  it's one of those  " drama of life "  films ,  as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptive .   i liked the light and the girls .  the rest was without too much fault ,  but without too much merit either .  i yearned for something like the interview ,  or at least some matrix villain element here and there ,  but nothing out of the ordinary .  the story does teach one about facing one's own destiny and break free from the environment others build for you ,  but this happens when the life giving peach factory in the area is about to close ,  so not much of an effort to change things is required .   the  " smart "  american beauty sound-alike song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack ,  but just that one playing over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of film .   in the end ,  i guess it did his job of presenting a part of australian life ,  but to me it didn't seem specifically australian  ( it could have been placed anywhere )  and it didn't seem attractive as a story .   i guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie . 
i really enjoyed the performances of the main cast .  emma lung is courageous and interesting .  the director has developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional .  a complex story with the changing between eras .  also appreciated the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town .  i do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive .  there have be many relationships with older men and younger women - without the male being good looking .  depth of character can be appealing to the not so shallow .  the film has a good look and the cinematography is also good . 
this story is beautifully acted .  it is both sad and heartwarming about a young girl's journey to discover where she has come from and where she is going .  stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car crash ,  and ever since she has been labeled the 'miracle baby' ,  she is dyslexic and is finding life a bit tough .  her findings along the way affect those closest around her .  her relationship with her guardian and her guardian's ex boyfriend are handled very delicately and sensitively ,  and the whole of the supporting cast are genuine ,  3 dimensional and believable .  set around a peach canning factory in small town australia ,  this is a warm gentle ,  erotic film ,  and leaves you with a pleasant feeling when the credits close .  after reading some of the other rather shallow comments about hugo weaving ,  i would like to add that i think he was brilliantly cast ,  and was extremely sexy .  no ,  he is not brad pitt ,  but that doesn't mean that he isn't attractive . 
i was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie .  i thought the writer - sue smith - very clearly summarised what the film was about .  however ,  the movie really didn't need explanation .  i thought the themes were abundantly clear ,  and inspiring .  a movie which deals with the the ability to dare ,  to face fear - especially fear passed down from parental figures - and overcome it and ,  in doing so ,  embrace life's possibilities ,  is a film to be treasured and savoured .  i enjoyed it much more than the much-hyped 'somersault . ' i also think mandy62 was a bit unkind to hugo weaving .  as a bloke about his vintage ,  i should look so good !  i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently ,  but 'peaches' delivers the goods .  i'm glad i saw it . 
the story is being told fluidly .  there are no interruptions .  the flash backs are woven into the present seamlessly .  casting was superb .  young ya'ara looked very much like ya'ara would have looked at that age .  her portrayal of a blind person was done convincingly .  director daniel syrkin have done a superb job in getting the various actors to work together in this story .  the cinematography is very good .  you feel like you are with ya'ara and talia walking toward the ocean to the edge of the cliff .  the english subtitles follow the hebrew script very closely .  it is interesting to note that even though  " out of sight "  is not a direct translation of  " lemarit ayin "  both names are very appropriate to the story . 
billed as takashi miike's  " first family film "  - by people who haven't seen zebraman ,  presumably .  yokai daisenso takes things even further in the direction of family-friendliness ,  diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale .  a young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware .  the film is evidently bigger budget than anything else miike has done ,  with lots of cgi to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures  ( the yokai )  .  perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors ,  but i think it's probably just that he wanted to do something different .  he's really never been a one-trick pony ,  but often gets accused of it - perhaps yokai is designed to silence those critics .  regardless ,  it's a great project for miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into .   there's a very cartoonish feel to the production ,  evoking thoughts of miyazaki in places .  the yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on japanese folk tales ,  which certainly influenced miyazaki as well  ( particularly spirited away )  .  it must remembered that miike has nothing like the budget of a harry potter film to work with ,  so the special effects aren't going to be seamless hollywood style work - some blue-screening is especially obvious .  some of the special effects are great though ,  with some very well animated creatures  ( a mix of cg ,  stop-motion and puppetry )  .  i think the little sock-puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was *meant* to look really cheap ,  and is all the cuter for it  :  )  the young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job - it's so hard to find a pre-teen who actually understands the concept of acting ,  but 9 year old ryunosuke kamiki is a genuine talent  ( i see he did voices in the last 2 miyazaki films !  )  .  chiaki kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece ,  though mai takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie-eared river princess - yum yum !  those looking for another violent ,  perverted gangster film aren't going to find what they're looking for in yokai ,  but if you're a fan of miike because of his imagination and wit ,  there's plenty to satisfy here .  and it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you've got  :  ) 
although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film ,  the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superb .   yaara ,  studying at princeton ,  returns to her native israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend ,  talia .  because yaara practically lived with her friend's parents after the death of her own mother ,  she has lost her adoptive sister .  and because yaara ,  blind from birth ,  has been guided and guarded by talia ,  her friend's suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable .   inevitably ,  the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death .  though without sight ,  she has insight .  though she cannot see ,  she is able to find what is out of sight than the  " normal "  people around her .  the film thus becomes an absorbing mystery as yaara scours for clues in memories of her relationship with talia ,  in her adoptive family's house ,  in tapes ,  diaries ,  and people in talia's past and present .   told from yara's point of view ,  the film is also seen from her point of view ,  as she visualizes what she hears ,  believes ,  and imagines .  the solution to the mystery is rather conventional ,  but the search is conducted with such subtle care and the answer rendered so beautifully and without fanfare ,  that the pat moment is easily forgiven .  the truths emerge gradually yet inexorably ,  clarifying not only talia's life ,  but also her relationship with yaara .  tali sharon ,  as yaara ,  uses her mobile face and voice effectively ,  and is utterly believable as both the adult and teenage girl .  we accept fully her ability by the film's end to find her place in the world more confidently .   noteworthy is the precision by which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious ,  the dead-on acting by the minor characters ,  and the interesting decision to represent talia only as a teenager .  i will quibble with yaara's final declaration as stands with gadi ,  talia's last boyfriend ,  at a cliff's edge ,  but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be recalled . 
i won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide .  it unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life .  as she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates ,  it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion .  the film is expertly paced and the acting ,  especially by talia sharon as ya'ara ,  the blind woman ,  is excellent .  israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films ,  though few have found a large audience in the u . s . 
once a year  " comes "  a movie like that and makes things easy for you .  you don't have make an effort to think it is good ,  it's just is .  you enjoy it while you watch it ,  and you take it home with you .  i can't say it is totally flawless ,  but it's near .  acting - great ,  story -interesting and with elements of suspense .  it's a small family story ,  pretty much predictable ,  but it's not the secret itself that matters .  it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it .  i was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship  ( the blind girl and her cousin )  .  the only thing i didn't like that much is the actress that played the mother ,  she was too tough and without necessity .  keren
i give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting  " guess who "  game .  the movie ,  however ,  needs more robin in it .  he appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest .  i always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new robin character ,  let alone knightwing .  this movie just continues that bad tradition .  the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his romance which wouldn't be so bad in one movie if the romance wasn't so unbelievable .  it is still a good movie if you are a batman fan and i would recommend watching it . 
i thought the film could be a bit more complex , in a psychological sense perhaps ,  but the action and voice acting were top notch .  the animation was heavy cg in many scenes ,  but very good ones at that .  this is one of the batman returns/forever type films ,  which include romances and the conflicts of wayne and motives for dating .  007 fans would love this ,  and so would the females ,  great theme song !  wayne was portrayed very well in this film ,  and the penquin was back to his true form ,  no mutant genes in him this time !  i liked the fact robin wasn't used too much ,  tim drake was just a good computer nerd ,  somewhat of an indigo child or mind of the future .   the supporting cast was made up of some soap opera stars ,  decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like the voice actors too .  kelly ripa was hilarious in this film .   i rate this below phantasm ,  return of the joker ,  and batman vs .  dracula ,  but liked the smarter script better than i enjoyed subzero .  7/10
i always said that the animated batman movies were much better than the live action films .   i've seen all of the animated films ,  but out of the bunch ,  this is the poorest ,  and it's rather disappointing .    " mask of the phantasm "  would rank as the best ,  then  " world's finest "  ,  then  " sub zero "  ,  then  " return of the joker "  ,  and finally this ranks last .   in this newest animated movie ,  there's a mysterious new batgirl in gotham and batman is intent on discovering whether she's friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeance .   but as bruce gets involved with three young women ,  he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirl .   the tone in this film is unusually light considering most of the films are grim and bleak ,  which was rather disappointing .  bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time ,  the villains are re-used from the last films ,  and while the action scenes are exciting ,  they're really nothing new .  it also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have ,  especially that of  " sub-zero "  which was heavy in drama and character development .   everything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming but no one is actually worth rooting for .   all the while ,  i really enjoyed this ,  i had a blast ,  and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising ,  but this wasn't as exciting as i'd hoped .

in 1993 ,  with the success of the first season of batman :  the animated series ,  warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie ,  originally slated for direct-to-video ,  but bumped up to theatrical status .  it would become known as batman :  mask of the phantasm .  ten years after phantasm ,  we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the wb ,  sub-zero ,  return of the joker ,  and now ,  mystery of the batwoman joins the family .   the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm :  a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin .  now ,  batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line .   the animation is the sleeker ,  futuristic style that was utilized for batman :  the animated series' fifth and sixth seasons  ( aka the new batman adventures )  .   ,  it's quite nicely done ,  and just as sleek as return of the joker's animation .  there is also some use of cgi ,  but it's minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub-zero .  the music was alright .  different and exotic and similar to the justice league score ,  although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans' rodent-shaped hearts .   kevin conroy ,  as always ,  does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman .  it's also great to have the old batman :  the animated series alumni back ;  that includes bob hastings  ( commissioner gordon )  ,  robert costanzo  ( detective bullock )  ,  tara strong  ( barbara gordon/batgirl ;  her cameo hints at the romantic-relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond )  ,  and efrem zimbalist jr .  ( alfred )  .   villains were also great - especially given that rupert thorne ,  the old mob boss from the original series ,  appears for the first time since the fourth season .   overall ,  while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago ,  motb carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films .  and if you have the dvd and are a hardcore fan ,  you will love the five-minute short chase me . 
batman :  mystery of the batwoman is the latest animated batman straight to video/dvd movie to be released .   ( minor spoilers ahead )  the plot revolves around a new crimefighter ,  the batwoman ,  who seems to be personally involved ,  for whatever reason ,  in stopping a major arms shipment .   although the movie is interesting enough ,  it's not as good as 'mask of the phantasm , ' 'sub-zero , ' or 'return of the joker . ' the main reason being is that it doesn't give off the emotional appeal the other movies did .  at the end of this movie ,  we don't really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others ,  especially ,  'sub-zero . ' there is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us .  even the batwoman is not really a 'tragic' character  ( as mr .  freeze or phantasm were )  .  not only that ,  but batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly 'stiff' and dull that the viewer doesn't really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we don't get this special emotional appeal .   don't get me wrong ,  i did find the movie enjoyable .  it does have its moments ,  such as ,  when the audience finds out who batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original 'batman :  the animated series . ' the action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments .   if the batwoman's background was more interesting ,  this movie would have been better than 'return of the joker' in my book ,  but as it is now ,  it's in 4th  ( out of 4 )  .   as for the animation ,  it's the same as the new batman adventures' cartoon from the mid to late 1990's .  the score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated batman films ,  but it's still good nonetheless .   i do recommend buying this dvd because ,  despite its flaws ,  it is enjoyable .  but just remember ,  it's not as good as the other batman animated movies .   7/10
it aired on tv yesterday ,  so i decided to check it out .  this was one of the last bruce timm/paul dini dtv projects related to their old 1992 batman the animated series ,  after that jeff matsuda came along and re-imagined batman with his new the batman series ,  but anyway ,  the story of this new batman movie centers around the appearance of a new vigilante known as batwoman ,  however batman feels the need to stop her because of her extreme methods ,  and also in the meantime take down the pengiun and ruphert thorn who both are secretly working with carlton duquesne ( who's having family troubles )  and another villain ( which is later revealed in the movie )  on a weapons smuggling operation , they also put a bounty on the batwoman .  the question is :  who is this mysterious batwoman and is it possible that they could be more then one ?  it's up to batman to solve this mystery and stop penguin's latest operation .  for an animated movie ,  it has a fairly complex plot and a serious tone ,  which is good .  another plus was the complete redesign of the penguin who looks much more like the sophisticated mob boss we're used to seeing in the comics ,  unlike his previous designs that borrowed elements from tim burton vision of pengium ( sewer rat and circus freak )  .  even though the movie contains a love subplot it's never carried that far and doesn't derail the movie like say ,  batman forever .  the voice acting is standard quality for these direct-to-video projects ( if only batman :  mask of phantasm took this route )  ,  kevin conroy still shines as batman/bruce wayne .  and like i said despite running for some very short 80 minutes ,  it manages to make a pretty good ( and complex )  storyline complete with a few minor twists and bucket loads of action .  there are a few downsides ,  however ,  nightwing is nowhere to be seen ,  and i'm sure barbara gordon and bruce wayne don't click as a couple ,  even though is just referenced ,  tim drake ( aka robin )  does very little in the movie and to be quite frank ,  i was never a big fan of paul dini and bruce timm's batman character design ( especially in their batman shows post-btas )  ,  this the new adventures of batman and robin ,  well ,  it kinda makes batman look fat then rather a well-built bulked up individual ( kinda like the jeff matsuda character model from the batman )  .  bruce wayne seems a bit awkward ,  those blue eyes make him look more like clark kent then bruce ( though it's true they do look very much alike )  .  another downside is rupert throne ( no explanation as to why he is in this deal ,  but it's safe to say he's has goons and what's a cut of the deal )  which does very little more then hang out with the penguim or get himself hurt every time he points a gun at someone ( count how many times this happens in the movie and you'll be surprised .  overall ,  a good batman animated movie ,  worth at least a rental . 
peaceful rancher robert sterling is on the losing side of a range war with his ruthless neighbors ,  that is until notorious outlaw robert preston shows up out of the blue to level the playing field .  soon he begins to go too far ,  feeding a growing sense of unease in sterling ,  especially when his son begins to idolize the wily criminal .   the sundowners is a tightly-paced ,  gritty ,  and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by preston .  here ,  he comes across as an evil version of shane ,  that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaw's relationship is revealed .  most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise !   rounding out the cast is chill wills ,  jack elam ,  and the debut of john drew barrymore ,  who became more famous for his offspring than his acting . 
an enjoyable batman animated film .  not on par with  " return of the joker "  or  " mask of the phantasm "  ,  but solid nonetheless .  i liked how the movie kept you guessing as to who batwoman was .  there was nice twist .  nice action sequences .  i've always been of the opinion that the batman cartoons are better then any of the pitiful batman live action film sequels .  the trend continues here .   7 . 5 out of 10
this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd  ,  since my 33 rpm got lost , and any cassettes i made are also long gone .   i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music  ,  which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin  (  esp little st .  nick  !   )  it also contained a few little known songs  (  original  ?   )  .   even though it was done at the end of the '70's this show had a timeless feel to it .  hoping to find a copy soon  !  !  ! 
working-class romantic drama from director martin ritt is as unbelievable as they come ,  yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars jane fonda and robert de niro  ( both terrific )  .  she's a widow who can't move on ,  he's illiterate and a closet-inventor--you can probably guess the rest .  adaptation of pat barker's novel  " union street "   ( a better title !  )  is so laid-back it verges on bland ,  and the film's editing is a mess ,  but it's still pleasant ;  a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy .  there are no overtures to serious issues  ( even the illiteracy angle is just a plot-tool for the ensuing love story )  and no real fireworks ,  though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree .  the finale is pure fluff--and cynics will find it difficult to swallow--though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn't really be satisfying any other way .  *** from ****
this post may contain spoilers  :   although it was 5 years after the series ended and wb was currently working on justice league ,  this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library .  why ?  well ,  if mask of the phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of batman :  the animated series and subzero compliments the 15 episodes of the adventures of batman and robin ,  then mystery of the batwoman compliments the final 24 episodes of the gotham knights version of batman .  kevin conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection .  i admit i was a bit leery when i heard about batwoman and all i could think about were the old 50's comics of batman .  but i was blown away by the batwoman character ,  her look ,  her costume  ( which i assumed inspired bruce wayne to create the costume on batman beyond ) and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who batwoman is all the way through .  if you want to know who batwoman is ,  then buy or rent the dvd .  barbara gordon makes a cameo appearance and i think the writers were trying to hint that bruce and barbara had something going on between them like they did in batman beyond .  tim drake appears as robin ,  but his role is a small one and sadly ,  there is no sign of or mention of dick grayson alias nightwing ,  which leads me to believe he has established himself in bludhaven  ( his city in the comics )  .   of the three suspects for batwoman ,  my favorite is kathy duquesne ,  who looks an awful lot like halle berry .  kelly ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects .  when it comes to the villains ,  i'm glad the penguin was one of them ,  but i did not like the fact that they replaced paul williams with david ogden stiers .  pengy just didn't sound right .  same thing goes for robin .  the new guy did okay ,  but just as i was starting to get used to matt valencia ,  they replaced him .  it's interesting to note that kevin michael richardson ,  who voices carlton duquesne is now the voice of the joker in  " the batman "  series .  and we finally see what rupert thorne looks like revamped since he didn't show up in the gotham knights episodes .  the late john vernon will be missed .  although i enjoyed henry silva as the voice of bane ,  if he had to be replaced ,  they got the right man in the form of hector elizondo .  i only wish they could have used two face ,  riddler ,  or the scary new version of the scarecrow .   the musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb .  i wish that was on a soundtrack and i especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented cherie in the iceberg lounge along with her song ,  betcha neva .  while some feel that this movie is weaker than the mask of the phantasm and subzero ,  i find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest ,  plus like i said earlier ,  it's a full length movie based off the gotham knights version of batman ,  which i think gives a good balance .  i would at least recommend renting this dvd first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie ,  but personally ,  it's well worth the purchase .  i give mystery of the batwoman a 9 . 
the original animated dark knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals mask of phantasm in its coolness .  there's a lot of style and intelligence in mystery of the batwoman ,  so much more than batman forever or batman and robin .   there's a new crime-fighter on the streets of gotham .  she dresses like a bat but she's not a grown-up batgirl .  and batman is denying any affiliation with her .  meanwhile bruce wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work .  but the penguin ,  bain and the local mob makes things little more complicated .   i didn't have high hopes for this 'un since being strongly let down but the weak batman :  sub zero  ( robin isn't featured so much here !  ) but i was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces ,  the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor .  this is definitely a movie no fan of batman should be without .  keep your ears open for a really catchy song called 'betcha neva' which is featured prominently through-out .   it's a shame the dvd isn't so great .  don't get me wrong there are some great features  ( the short 'chase me' is awesome )  and a very cool dolby 5 . 1 soundtrack but .  .  .  the movie is presented in pan and scan .  batman :  mystery of the batwoman was drawn and shot in 1 . 85 : 1 but this dvd is presented in 1 . 33 : 1 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there is picture cut off on both sides .  i find this extremely annoying considering mask of phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen .  warner have had to re-release literally dozens of movies on dvd because people have complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some titles .  why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me .   i would give this dvd 5/5 but the lack of oar brings the overall score down to 4/5 .  it's a shame because widescreen would have completed a great dvd package . 
for starters i have always been a fan of the batman cartoons because the theme is so universal ,  'that everyone alive has an alter-ego' .  this is true in the mystery of batwoman .  while the overall story is good i'm disappointed that they haven't really done much for the franchise with this .   throughout the movie ,  you are trying to find out who the identity of batwoman is ,  unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website  ( so if you haven't seen it already don't go there )  .  i was sort of disappointed that they didn't make the movie longer .  75 minutes is way too short for any movie .  the secret identity of batwoman also comes far too early in the movie ,  sort of midway ,  and becomes anti-climatic afterward because you know the good guys will always win and that the new character known as batwoman will disappear after the movie is over .   i'm also not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie .  i love the sleek new characters but there should be some more detail where detail is called for .  some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid that it grabs your attention right away diverting your attention away from the storyline .  i also didn't really like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes ,  it sort of loses its dark and gothic feel which is batman .  similarly we should've gotten to know more about batwoman's personality so that we can build the same deep compassionate feeling that we do with bruce wayne .  also i think the fight with bane should have been done better .  in typical children's fashion the bad guy meets his demise too easily either by tripping ,  falling ,  getting electricuted or doing something dumb that works against them .  come to think of it there wasn't even one drop of blood spilled in this movie either .   bottom line ,  its a good entertaining flick and i recommend anyone who's a batman fan to watch it .  it has good storyline ,  universal appeal and even great acting to top it off .  i just wish that they could have delivered more permanent change to the story by making batwoman stay to make things more interesting .  not just introduce her and then kick her off once she's done .  i'd also like to see someone else figure out the mystery for a change finally .  to have some other than batman solve the mystery and fill him in later with the details .   i hope there are more animated movies to come and look forward to the time when we will actually be able to see the breakup between bruce wayne and barbra gordan .  he's been stringing her along forever and doesn't even like her and i can't believe that she was dumb enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older .  i also want to see the time when tim drake leaves because he is getting sick of the old man .  in short i want to see all of the things that led the characters to where they will be in batman beyond .  otherwise the same repeated formula will just end it faster than if they just decided to move on with the story .   
this batman movie isn't quite as good as batman mask of the phantasm and batman and mr .  freeze subzero but it is still a good installment to the batman cartoons i say it is equally good as batman beyond the movie .  this movie is good for all the same reasons the storyline is good not quite as good as the other one's but still pretty good it has lots of action in it the cartoon effects are good the voice of actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman/ bruce wayne ,  tara strong as barbra gordon ,  efrem zimbalist jr .  ,  eli marienthal as robin .  the villains are good such as kyra sedgwick as batwoman ,  david ogden stiers as the pequin ,  hector elizondo as bane .  so i am sure you will not be disappointed with batman mystery of the batwomen .  so make sure that you rent or buy batman mystery of the batwoman the movie because it is really good .   overall score :  ******* out of **********   *** out of *****
 " batman :  the mystery of the batwoman "  is about as entertaining as animated batman movies get .   while still true to the feeling of the comic books ,  the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series .  bruce wayne looks much like he has before ,  but now he appears somewhat less imposing .  the dick grayson robin has been replaced by the less edgy ,  more youthful tim drake robin .   kevin conroy ,  as usual ,  invokes the voice of batman better than most live action actors .   kelly ripa did a much more decent voice-acting job than i was expecting .   as in the live action batman films ,  the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains .  my all-time favorite ,  the penguin ,  is here .  his design is sleeker than it has appeared before ,  hearkening more to the burgess meredith portrayal of the '60's than the danny devito portrayal of  " batman returns .  "  david ogden stiers is the perfect choice for the penguin's voice .  the penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate ,  just as he most commonly appears in the comics .  hector elizondo's voice creates a bane who's much more memorable than the forgettable version in  " batman & robin .  "  and finally ,  batman has a descent mystery to solve ,  putting the  " detective "  back in  " detective comics "   ( that is what  " dc "  stands for ,  after all .  )  the revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist .   the score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie .  it sounds like a mix between the score from  " poirot "  and the score from  " mission :  impossible .  "  all in all ,  it's more entertaining than your average cartoon . 
'capital city' fans rejoice !  this first season of this series is now available from network dvd and i've recently got my copy !  although very much an ensemble piece of key 'maverick' trading floor characters 'capital city' does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line .  the cultural mix  ( english ,  irish ,  american ,  german ,  polish )  of head trader wendy foley's  ( played by joanna phillips-lane )  group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms ,  interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and ,  to most people ,  seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast .  in fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old-fashioned senior management of shane longman as represented by lee wolf  ( richard le parmentier )  and james farrell  ( denys hawthorne )  .  i suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by wendy's team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful reclusive 'free spirit' peter longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy ,  relaxed modern way of business become a reality .  to a certain degree wendy's  ( i am led to believe )  immediate supervisor leonard ansen  ( john bowe )  follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his fondness for wendy rather sees him occupying the 'middle ground' on most occasions .  the main interest in the series ,  i believe ,  stems from the simmering romantic attraction between douglas hodge's declan and the cool self-assured blonde haired german trader michelle hauptmann  ( played by trevyn mcdowell )  which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship/fondness that they undoubted have .   looking forward to browsing through this title ,  and hopefully the second season of thirteen won't be too far away ! 
i agree that capital city should be on dvd .  i watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with rolf saxon as hudson talbot .  it was nice to see americans who work abroad in london in the financial industry for a change .  i loved rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in .  i can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes .  i liked william armstrong as hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series .  when they aired this show in the new york city area ,  it was always late at night or at off times .  the show is less than an hour long .  i felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting .  i didn't care for sylvia but missed the actress ,  julia phillips-lane in the previous season .  i felt this show took chances and often it worked .  it showed americans who loved and chose to live in london .  the american characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their british counterparts .  i also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all british .  i liked watching julia ormond in an early role .  i felt this show should have lasted longer .  i felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour .  they could have transferred the cast to new york city and it would have been a hit in america . 
i remember this series so well .  it was excellent - such strong and compelling characters ,  stylish and sexy  .  .  .  and so different to everything else on offer at the time - and now  .  .  .  i am sure that it inspired the also excellent canadian drama  " traders "  .    both season 1 and season 2 are available on dvd region 2 in the uk .  its a treat to watch the series again .   season 1 is 13 episodes and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes .   unfortunately ,  it seems to have ended after 2 seasons .   this series was a lot of fun .   sometimes you can get it on special at amazon . co . uk
the summary line above ,  spoken by james cloud  ( robert preston )  to his brother tom  ( robert sterling )  just about says it all .  jim ,  aka kid wichita ,  has a way of making things happen ,  only trouble is ,  he usually leaves dead bodies where he's been .  not the sort of mentoring tom envisions for younger brother jeff ,  who likes what he sees in jim ,  especially when defending their ranch against local texas cattlemen .   the opening credits state 'introducing john barrymore jr .  as the younger brother' ,  in this his very first screen appearance .  that seemed rather odd to me ,  particularly since he was addressed as jeff almost immediately into the story .  approximately eighteen at the time of this movie ,  he bears a passing resemblance to sean penn .  no stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career as well as estrangement from his family ,  i was left wondering if his daughter drew barrymore might have ever seen this picture .  i'm inclined to think not .   on the subject of resemblances ,  i was also struck by the thought that the young robert sterling looked a bit like roy rogers early in his career .  knowing sterling previously only from his role as george kerby in the early 1950's tv series 'topper' ,  i thought he looked out of place in a western ,  but that might just be me .  his character becomes emboldened by his brother's resourcefulness at creating trouble ,  and provides some of the edginess to this not so typical story .  minor subplots abound ,  including the relationship rancher john gall  ( john litel )  has with his son the sheriff  ( who kid wichita kills )  ,  and the troubled marriage between kathleen boyce  ( cathy downs )  and her husband earl  ( who kid wichita kills )  .  chill wills rounds out the main cast as one of tom cloud's hired hands ,  and figures in the somewhat predictable finale .   what's not quite predictable is how things eventually wind up there ,  and for that reason ,  this western earns points for following a less traveled ,  hence not quite as formulaic a plot as a lot of good brother/bad brother westerns do .  combined with the eclectic casting of the principals ,  it's one i'd recommend ,  even if you have to endure some of the jump cuts and sloppy editing that i experienced with my copy . 
it begins with several of the principles on a stage run to albuquerque .  gabby hayes ( juke ,  sounds like duke )  is the driver and begins his usual tirade against women in general ,  with his girlfriend pearl being an exception .  he then relates a garbled version of the biblical story of samson to justify his retention of long whiskers against the wishes of pearl ,  who is the town barber ,  no less ,  and who claims if everyone followed his example ,  she would be out of business .  this point will return to dominate the last scene in the film .  gabby seems an irritation to some reviewers ,  but is a definite plus to this one .  it's too bad he wasn't in more of the better randoph scott westerns to help lighten up randy's usual iron-jawed demeanor .  also on this stage are randy ( cole armin )  ,  his future wife ( cathrine craig  ,  as celia wallace )  ,  whom he is getting acquainted with ,  and a little girl ( myrtle )  ,  to whom he soon becomes a hero when he rescues her from the runaway stage after it is held up by henchman of randy's wheelchair-bound uncle john armin ( george cleveland )  ,  who essentially runs the town .   randy soon learns that his uncle ,  and by extension ,  himself ,  is not exactly popular among the town folk .  he does ,  however ,  quickly form a useful friendship with gabby .  after he learns that uncle john was responsible for the stage holdup of his business competitor ,  celia wallace ,  and the associated murder ,  he demands that uncle john return the money and decides to work for celia and her brother ted ( russell hayden )  ,  instead of for uncle john .    as his rival's prospects rise ,  uncle john decides to plant an informant ( barbara britton ,  as letty tyler )  in the wallace office ,  to keep him informed as to when they are delivering ore from the mines to town so that he can sabotage their run .  when this doesn't work ,  he resorts to the draconian tactic of staging an arson of his own office ,  for which randy is blamed .  unfortunately ,  when the fire was discovered ,  randy was in letty's apartment confronting her with suggestive evidence that she was tipping off uncle john .  myrtle and letty testify that he was in the apartment when the fire was discovered .  this puts him and letty in the dog house with celia ( his apparent beau )  and ted ( who hopes to woo letty )  .  this news also ends uncle john's trust in letty as an informant ,  and he suggests she leave town .  instead ,  she switches sides and tells the wallaces why randy was in her apartment .  uncle john tries once again to sabotage their ore run ,  and when that fails ,  there is a general shootout in town .  you can guess the results .   the plot is well constructed and executed ,  with complicated relationships between the principles ,  and with a variety of obstacles for randy to overcome ,  with the sometimes aid of his associates .  at least ,  randy was spared the necessity of bringing his uncle to justice .  uncle john had a choice to avoid assassination ,  but arrogantly trusted that a woman wouldn't have the guts to carry out her threat .  the presence of hayes and two beautiful wholesome single women ,  as well as little myrtle ,  much helped to lighten the otherwise tense atmosphere in this battle for survival ,  as uncle john put it .   it seems odd that barbara britton ,  the  " bad "  girl ,  gets top female billing over catherine craig ,  randy's love interest .  barbara's on camera time was much more limited .    those who grew up on the lassie tv series featuring george cleveland as  " gramps "  will be surprised to find him playing such a mean controlling villain .  we may wonder if his wheelchair-bound status has a bearing on this persona .  this leaves him with few options for making a living in the wild west .  without apparent family to help support him ( except randy )  ,  he can't afford to have some upstart beat him out of the most profitable business in town .  on the other hand ,  from his conversations ,  he probably achieved his status as the town  " boss "  before becoming wheelchair-bound . 
randolph scott is heading into albuquerque to take a job with his uncle .  however ,  on the way there ,  the stage is held up--even though they are not carrying a strongbox .  however ,  a nice lady on board is concealing $10 , 000 for her and her brother's business .  .  . and the robbers seem to know this .   once in town ,  scott goes to this uncle about the job .  however ,  he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk--the typical bad guy from westerns .  you know ,  the rich guy who only wants to become richer by cheating and stealing and threatening until he owns everything .  and ,  it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery .  scott demands that the uncle returns the money and then scott goes into business with the nice lady and her brother .   not surprisingly ,  this is not the end of the problems---just the beginning .  again and again ,  intrigues of various types occur to try to crush the uncle's opposition .  one trick is to bring in a pretty lady to befriend scott and his partners .  she's a crack shot and it looks bad for scott--until he figures out why she's come to town .   unlike most later randolph scott films ,  this one shows scott as a bit more headstrong man .  all too often in his films he's the last one to suggest violence ,  but in this film he's quick to suggest a lynching  ( screw the law ,  let's have a hangin' )  and later he's quick to threaten the uncle .  what a surprise to see him as such a hot-head--though in most other ways ,  he's the same old scott you'd expect .   as far as the film goes ,  there's nothing particularly unusual about it .  gabby hayes plays the usual character ,  scott is a hero ,  the baddie cannot be reasoned with and ultimately is destroyed and scott gets the girl .  despite this very typical plot ,  it's all handled very well and as a result is well worth your time .   by the way ,  there are two weird scenes in the film .  first ,  late in the movie ,  there is a fist fight between scott and the uncle's #1 henchman ,  lon chaney ,  jr .  .  in it ,  chaney smokes as he fights--something i never saw before and i did admire how he could puff away as he got his butt kicked .  second ,  get a load of that runaway cart scene with the whip--now that was one impossible feat ! 
albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a class a western ,  except one :  the story ,  that really belongs to a class b or c .  that was acceptable at the time the film was made ,  when people were so thrilled to see a western in color ,  but nowadays it just looks very primitive .  nonetheless for people who enjoy old westerns ,  it is entertaining ,  the original color and sound are very well kept on the dvd that recently came out .  gabby hayes is a good sidekick ,  lon chaney is mean as always ,  and randolph scott a bit more cheerful than usual .  in a film named albuquerque you would expect to see something that would remind you of the city ,  but the town that is shown here could be just anywhere . 
for me too ,  this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly .  in 1989 ,  i snatched up the 2 cds i found of the soundtrack recording ,  giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself .  it's part of my family's christmas tradition now ,  and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listen .   it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show ,  and they did more than one special together .  the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here ,  in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages . 
according to the book the last of the cowboy heroes which is about joel mccrea ,  audie murphy ,  and randolph scott ,  the author says that albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost .  hadn't been seen in years .   good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at paramount because a print was apparently found and now it's out on the open market .  albuquerque is a pretty good western too with scott involved in a family feud with uncle george cleveland .   george cleveland sends for his nephew randolph scott with the intention of making him part of his freighting business ,  headquartered in the fast growing settlement of albuquerque .  cleveland is more than just a business owner ,  he's the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair .  he even has the sheriff in his pocket .    randolph scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing .  that includes not backing relatives up when they're villains .  he goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister russell hayden and catherine craig .   cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and he even sends for a western mata hari in the person of barbara britton to worm her way into the confidence of his rivals .  barbara's great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda .   randolph scott's original home studio was paramount ,  it was where his first studio contract was with .  albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for paramount and they gave him a good one .   note also lon chaney ,  jr .  ,  who is george cleveland's chief henchman ,  a rather loathsome bully of a man and gabby hayes ,  who is just gabby hayes .   albuquerque must have been loved by republicans across the nation in 1948 with its chief villain as a town boss who rules from a wheelchair .  a certain democrat from a wheelchair had made hash of them for four straight presidential elections and he was gone .  they had high hopes of winning the white house that year too ,  but things went awry and they had to settle for an ersatz boss getting his comeuppance in albuquerque .  i'm not sure why cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot .  my guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to .   still albuquerque must have had great appeal to the gop market . 
 " the big goodbye "  introduces us to the first holodeck adventure ,  in this case captain picard posing as private investigator dixon hill .  this episodes creates some sort of standard pattern ,  repeated several times on tng as well as ds 9 and voyager .  after entering the holodeck something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances beyond playing a game  ( represented by the failure of the holodeck's safety program )  .    this concept is used to expand star trek's possibility and enabling a kind of genre-mix .  picard's dixon hill stories are examples of 1940s crime fiction and their representation on the screen are referred to as film noir often having the stereotype antihero in the lead  ( see for example chandler's marlowe stories or polanski's all time classic  " chinatown "  )  .  star trek never focuses on the story  ( mostly it's a simple  " how-do-we-get-out-of-here "  scenario )  but enables the actors to take a different approach to their characters .  those holodeck  " games "  are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members .  therefore the technical aspect is always neglected and from that point of view the stories are never sound  ( but did star trek ever had a technical ,  scientific point to it ,  i mean besides some utopic concepts ?  )  .    " the big goodbye "  shows a relaxed patrick stewart ,  a mcfadden that hardly ever looked better in a star trek episode  ( at least the early ones )  and data has some great scenes ,  too  ( although i find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp's plug out of the wall would have really surprised him ,  for the fact that he'd done research on that period and its customs )  .  wesley continues turning peaceful trekkies into potential murderers  ( why didn't they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him off ?  )  but all in all this one's fun .  .  . 
this episode introduced the holodeck to the tng world .  the jarada have to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would greatly insult them .  a tired picard decides to take a trip into the holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins .  the settings are superb and almost movie like .  alas ,  the jarada probe sent shortly thereafter damages the holodeck and all it's safety devices stop working .  picard and now guests must outwit the mobsters of gangland 40s america and return to the jarada rendezvous .  picard greets the jarada correctly and a new day dawns between humanity and the jarada .  this gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there
this peabody award winning episode is one of the highlights of the 1st season where a holodeck malfunction traps captain picard ,  beverly ,  data ,  and a starfleet historian named waylan within a 1930's san francisco setting .  this episode is an homage to raymond chandler's  " maltese falcon "  where patrick stewart assumes the humphrey bogart role - complete with fedora and trenchcoat .  the office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in bogey's  " maltese falcon .  "    this episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect race called the jarada that communicate with mostly a high-pitched buzzing sound .  communication with this alien race is difficult ,  and it is up to picard to communicate with this race in their native tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin .  the best part of this episode ,  though ,  is the appearance of the famous hollywood b-actor lawrence tierney in the role of the gangster cyrus redblock .  he was such a handsome man back in the 1940's .  oh ,  well .  .  . 
being the first feature film with robert de niro  ( although not released for years later )  ,  this is worth the watch .  de niro's role isn't huge ,  yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it .  any die hard de niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today . 
outrage is pretty good movie !  robert culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for the part !  its hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do ?  when i watched this i thought why do they have to do all of those things .  it isn't right but they learned their lesson when they picked on the wrong man !  anyway if you ever see this movie on tv watch it because its a good one ! 
i remember this movie .  quite intense for an 11 year old .  good editing ,  i felt terrible for the st .  bernard .  i'd watch it again if it were rebroadcast ,  but the signal is passing pluto as i write this .  robert culp .  a highlight of his career .  i am just glad i didn't live in that neighborhood .  oh those 70's .  what a decade .  if they remade it i bet it would be very violent and bloody .  so what are they waiting for ?  an excellent movie for pre-pubescent suburban boys .  it was very intense .  i think it was filmed in los angeles .  certainly not made in lodi nj .  the shot with the st bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the film .  .  . and then they left the carcass on the stoop .  rotten kids . 
sterling and younger brother try to survive on land ,  being squeezed by big cattlemen .  when 'rogue' brother preston arrives ,  a moral dilemma ensues .  john 'drew' barrymore steals the show as the younger ,  impressionable brother-barrymore shows signs here that he could have been an acting powerhouse .  moves at a nice pace to an exciting climax . 
robert culp  ( they call his character  " doctor "  .  .  . i think he's a vet or something )  and family move to an affluent ,  low-tax ,  zero-law-enforcement suburb .  lantern-jawed culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and  " go cruising "  through his front yard at 60mph .  he presses charges ,  which arouses the kids' ire ,  and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign .   marilyn manson ,  er ,  marlyn mason rather ,  plays his fretful ,  boiled-celery wife ,  who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses ,  and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services .  but the system is getting culp nowhere ,  and he's not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music .  and we all know what movie people do when the system fails .  .  .  ( but this is based on a true story ,  which makes it even better )  .   it should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient '70s funk-o-matic  " teenage "  theme music that warns us when they're up to no good ,  this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even-handedly  ( really !  )  .  it doesn't make a big generational thing out of it .  kudos for that .   anyway ,  if you like dogs  ( or at least believe in protecting their civil rights ,  like me )  ,  and you like justice ,  and you like fire ,  and you like justice for dogs by way of fire ,  and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are  " too damn soft ,  "  then this flick's ethos is up your alley .  no ,  it's not really  " good ,  "  at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word .  there's nothing subtle or understated or clever about it ,  it's just sort of a feature-length psa for vigilantism .  it does ,  however ,  capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other ,  beloved works .  remember in frank miller's the dark knight returns when batman leads the mutants on horseback to reclaim gotham city ?  remember that scene in a christmas story where the kid pounds the bully's face in ?  remember how cool that was ?  or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors ?  yeah ,  mon .   unfortunately ,  this was a 1973 made-for-tv movie that i just happened to catch at 4am on my local wb affiliate ,  and it's probably not destined for dvd release .  but after being inspired by this film ,  do you think i'm gonna just sit here and take it !  ?  ! 
this is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made-for-television drama .  my all-time favourite actor ,  robert culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system ,  kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime ,  and homicidal psychosis .  the teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes ,  and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of dragnet look evenhanded by comparison .  but what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie ,  building the fear and paranoia by degrees ,  as well as the feel of the whole california setting .  the cars are really great as well ,  as i recall .  i give this film a 10 ,  and i defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute .  remember ,  just because it's made-for-television doesn't mean it isn't great art . 
this is a very good ,  made for tv film .  it depicts trouble in suburbia circa 1970's and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around .  the worst & most upsetting part of the film was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog .  the teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family .  but boy !  ,  does the lead character take vengeance on those punk teenagers in the end .  the father/homeowner surely does not take all of the aggravation from the punk teens lightly and is quick to retaliate after lack of help from the police that is .  he stands up to them and protects his home and his family .  a very good actor .  . i might add .   i watched this on tv when i was like 8 or 9 .  i have never seen it again on tv and would like to .  definitely a good one !  it's the sort of movie one may catch on a weekday night very late at night and can't stop watching or an afternoon film on a weekend .  it's the kind they just don't show anymore .   it is definitely worth seeing ! 
i saw this film on true movies  ( which automatically made me sceptical )  but actually - it was good .  why ?  not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue  ( of which there is little )  but because actually ,  despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in it's depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy .   it's not dawson's creek ,  they're not graceful ,  cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge .  they're kids and they act like kids would .    they're blunt ,  awkward and annoyingly confused about everything .  yes ,  this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i don't think so .  dermot mulroney gives  ( when not trying to be cool )  a very believable performance and i loved him for it .  patricia arquette is whiny and annoying ,  but she was pregnant and a teenagers ?  the combination of the two isn't exactly lavender on your pillow .  the plot was very predictable and but so what ?  i believed them ,  his stress and inability to cope - her brave ,  yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together .  i think the characters ,  acted by anyone else ,  would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren't .  it reflects the surreality of the situation they're in ,  that he's sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby .  i felt angry at her for that ,  i felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her .  i felt it all .   in the end ,  i loved it and would recommend it .   watch out for the scene where dermot mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session - career performance . 
i first saw this movie when i was a freshman in high school ,  and the film has stuck with me through the years .  it's not about the soundtrack ,  or cinematography ,  or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting ,  it's about the educational purpose ,  and the message behind that is the most important .  it's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school ,  and it's not really a bad thing ,  either ,  but it is a problem .  tons of girls i knew are all having children now ,  and i guess they never watched this great movie ,  and if they did ,  they clearly didn't get the message behind it all .  it's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship .  any girl can get pregnant the first time .  it's not a myth .  you don't necessarily lose out on your dreams ,  but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first .   this movie has a clear message behind it :  just say no ! 
i really thought this wasn't that bad .  not a great work of art but dermot m was the stronger performer by far .  patricia arquette was overacting much of the time .  he was actually playing cello which was very impressive ,  and his lines were never forced .  besides ,  he is an incredibly beautiful man .  really sexy .  add that to the talent ,  and most anything he's been in is a lot more tolerable .  he always gives his all even if some of the projects he's been involved in didn't quite hit the highest mark .  .  not the fault of the actor in most cases .  he's unfortunately been in some strange films that just didn't resonate at the box office .  always with a-list actors but just not always a  " hit "  .  but he is  " worth every penny "  of any dvd rented or purchased .  see the wedding date with debra messing - one of his best overall films .  worth every penny !   ;   )   ( if you haven't seen it yet ,  do ,  then you'll understand that quote !  ) 
this flick is sterling example of the state of erotic b-movies :  bad porn movies without the hardcore sex .  the plot in this one isn't so bad as these things go ;  it involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent of killing his wife .  the rest of the movie ,  however ,  leaves something to be desired .  bad acting ,  bad direction ,  bad looking woman ,  bad sets ,  bad cinematography ,  bad sound and bad sex scenes .  the filmmakers should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic .  they don't even have the common sense to have gabriella hall naked or in a love scene .    how dumb is that ? 
great softcore sex ,  revealing and sexy ,  and plenty of it .  ignore the ignoramus who doesn't realize that raunchy is sexy if done the right way .  if you  " erotic ,  "  go watch that red shoes diary junk .  if you want hot and exciting softcore done properly ,  this is the movie to watch .  if you like the more explicit skinemax films ,  you'll like this one .  great softcore sex ,  revealing and sexy ,  and plenty of it .  ignore the ignoramus who doesn't realize that raunchy is sexy if done the right way .  if you  " erotic ,  "  go watch that red shoes diary junk .  if you want hot and exciting softcore done properly ,  this is the movie to watch .  if you like the more explicit skinemax films ,  you'll like this one . 
this low-budget erotic thriller that has some good points ,  but a lot more bad one .  the plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife .  being a soft-core film ,  that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects .  as plots go for this type of genre ,  not to bad .  the script is okay ,  and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 am watching this not to notice too many plot holes .  but everything else in the film seems cheap .  the lead actors aren't that bad ,  but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad  ( one girl seems like she is drunk and/or high )  .  the cinematography is badly lit ,  with everything looking grainy and ugly .  the sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying .  the worst thing in this movie is the reason you're watching it-the sex .  the reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in red shoe diary situations .  the sex scenes aren't hot they're sleazy ,  shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it .  the woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot .  i'm not trying to be rude or mean here ,  but they all have that breast implants and a burned out/weathered look .  even the title ,   " deviant obsession "  ,  sounds like a hardcore flick .  not that i don't have anything against porn - in fact i love it .  but i want my soft-core and my hard-core separate .  what ever happened to actresses like shannon tweed ,  jacqueline lovell ,  shannon whirry and kim dawson ?  women that could act and who would totally arouse you ?  and what happened to b erotic thrillers like body chemistry ,  nighteyes and even stripped to kill .  sure ,  none of these where masterpieces ,  but at least they felt like movies .  plus ,  they were pushing the envelope ,  going beyond hollywood's relatively prude stance on sex ,  sexual obsessions and perversions .  now they just make hard-core films without the hard-core sex . 
a nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it .  i saw it on late night tv .  there are two hardcore stars in it ,  lauen montgomery and venus .  thankfully ,  gabriella hall has just a small part . 
i'll be honest with you .  .  . i liked this movie .  it's a great zombie flick that is packed with action ,  original ideas ,  good acting ,  but is also packed with bad zombie effects .  part iv ,  entitled  " after death "  is also good .  i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere .   10 out of 10  fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master ,  skinned alive ,  slumber party massacre ,  sleep away camp ,  and other full moon pictures flicks .  for other recommendations ,  check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section . 
this is one of those westerns that ,  well ,  stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog .  very few can hold up to it over the long haul .  that said ,  the rest is pretty bad .  nevertheless i am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of the wild bunch ,  junior bonner ,  and perhaps a few more .    it is riddled with weaknesses ,  john drew barrimore the most glaring .  however it does have one truly memorable scene .  nothing like it .  its right after kid wichita kills the sheriff ,  and goes to jack elams place trying to goad him into a fight .  wonderful stuff .  right up with the best in any western . 
this movie is awesome on so many levels .  .  .  and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on .   just remember this :  when you're watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies .  .  .  be they good or bad .  .  .  this is the formula that they are using .  this is what makes zombie movies so great .   and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie .  a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know .   all in all ,  it doesn't linger .  there's never a point where you think to yourself  " c'mon ,  get on with it "  .  .  .  it moves quick and corners nicely .  this is the sporty ,  little italian number of zombie flicks .   so awful ,  it's wonderful !  if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek .  .  .  rent it ,  buy it ,  love it .   as a great trivia note :  if you're watching it on dvd ,  you'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen ,  underneath the musical score .  .  .  well .  .  .  that's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer .  .  .  which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop . 
nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie-flicks ,  but  honestly  why would we bother ?  every single film in the zombi- " series "  delivers great fun ,  nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and  " zombi 3 "  is no exception to this ,  despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting .  this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project ,  who had to elaborate further on his  " zombi 2 "  success ,  but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films .  the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity ,  every ingenious idea from george a .  romero's  " night of the living dead "  and  " the crazies "  is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at .  yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over-the-top gore compensates for everything !  on a secret army base at the phillipines ,  scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus  " death one "  and prepare it for transport .  after a failing attempt to steal the virus ,  the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie-ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village .  the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area .  this movie is comparable to umberto lenzi's  " nightmare city "  .  truly bad .  .  . but incredibly entertaining with fast-paced action sequences and several very creative zombie-madness situations .  the undead birds were original ,  for example ,  and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well .  the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick .  recommended to the fans ;  don't mind the negative reviews . 
we have high expectations with this one  .   .   .  because its zombi 3 the official sequel to zombi 2 and directed by lucio fulci  .   .   .  however  .   .   .  its co-directed by bruno mattei  ( from night of the zombies )  and not written by dardino sachetti but by claudio fagrasso  ( night of the zombies )  and its shot in the phillimines like night of the zombies and resembles night of the zombies  ( hell of the living dead )  a lot .  as a result its more like a companion to hell of the living dead than zombi 2 .  fabrazio deangelis who produced zombi 2 and its editor tomassi  (  ?  )  and efx gianetto de rossi gave zombi 2 its magic  .   .   .  zombi 3 is not magical  .   .   .  its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut-butter .  but over the years ,  i've grown to accept zombi 3 .  i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room  .   .   .  there was a senseless fulci-cut and the mattei/fulci-cut is the one on dvd . 
wow this was a great italian  " zombie "  movie by two great director's luci fulci  (  " zombie "  )  and bruno mattie  (  " hell of the living dead "  )  lucio started this movie and was ill so the great bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than i expected it to turn out so if you have seen  " hell of the living dead "  directed by bruno mattie and if you saw  " zombie "  directed by lucio fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great  " zombie "  make-up witch equals great looking  " zombies "  has a funny  " zombie "  flying head ! and  " zombie "  birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a  " zombie "   ( that only happed to two people )  but they are mainly just the great toxic  " zombies "  like in bruno matties  " hell of the living dead "  . so if you like italian  " zombie "  movies or just  " zombie "  movie's in general than check this one out its a great italian  " zombie "  movie ! 
a terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon ,  and in the process of trying to escape ,  he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised .  soldiers are able to retrieve the case ,  but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out .  they eventually make it to where he's hiding ,  and  " cleanse "  the hotel and its occupants .  unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation ,  and if you've seen return of the living dead ,  you know what happens next .   zombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike ,  as a complete mess of a movie .  while that's a fair assessment ,  it's not without it's high points .  for one thing ,  it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore-hounds happy .  there's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible .  they're in the water ,  the rafters of houses ,  hiding in trees ,  and for some reason ,  they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush ,  only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape .  there's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator .  you have to see it to believe it ,  as that scene alone makes zombi 3 required viewing imo .  it may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting ,  especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors i've seen ,  but zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie .  sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch a movie that doesn't require anything more than your time and an open mind .  zombi 3 fits that bill ,  and then some .  it's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers ,  and watch it with some like minded friends .  i give it an 8/10 ,  just because of sheer enjoyment . 
yeah sure it's cheesy ,  it's not zombie ,  but it's not that bad either .  it has beatrice ring which is a huge bonus ,  and it's entertaining .  i had the good fortune to meet fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience ,  as he was never completely satisfied with it .  it is well worth a search out ,  especially for genre and fulci fans .  it is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand . 
off the blocks let me just say that i am a huge zombie fan so i don't make statements like the above lightly .  secondly let me say that this is an italian zombie film and fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before handing over to bruno  ( rats ,  night of terror )  mattei .  this is no dawn of the dead folks .   that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen .    the script is wonderfully horrible .  just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote  (  " let's try putting these two molecules together "  )  .    the zombies come in all varieties .  from moaning shufflers ,  to machete wielding maniacs ,  to birds !    the gore is plentiful .  legs are bitten off ,  arms amputated ,  stomachs burst open .    the pace is fast ,  flying from one zombie attack to the next .    then there's the head in the fridge .  oh the head in the fridge !  one of the greatest moments in horror since ash got his hand possessed in evil dead 2 .   you should know already whether you're the sort of person who's going to like this sort of film .  get some mates and some beer and you'll be in for a fun night .   did i mention the head in the fridge ?  !  ?  !  ? 
although it's not as creepy as it's cult classic predecessor  ( zombi 2 )  i actually like this one better .  this is because of it's faster pace ,  better settings ,  and cool 80's soundtrack .  it's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci .  the zombies don't quite look as nasty as in zombi 2 but they still look good .  it was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness ;  for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas .  some are braindead while others say funny lines ,  but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror ?  there's even a flying zombie head !  how rad is that ?  definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans .  it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well .  also check out zombi 4 . 
zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making .  firstly ,  it is a sequel to fulci's hit zombi 2 ,  with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a .  romero's dawn of the dead aka zombi .  confusing enough ?  basically ,  none of the films have anything to do with one another ,  but who cares when they make money .  i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out .  bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time .   zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare .  scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines ,  terrorists steal it unleashing a plague ,  and zombie run amok .  the scientists want to create an antidote ,  while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice .  there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet .    overall ,  i actually liked this film .  i heard horrible things ,  but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable .  the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution ,  corrupted military ,  man playing god ,  etc .  i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film ,  but it veered off in a weird direction ,  presumably when mattei came on board .   besides ripping off other zombie flicks ,  this was very reminiscent of romero's the crazies .  you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with ,   " when you see the men in white suits & gas masks ,  run to them for help .  "  this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies .  later ,  they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular ,  uncontaminated people is killed by mistake .   the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner .  how is it cool ?  let me count the ways1 .  zombie birth 2 .  flying zombie head 3 .  zombie birds .  4 .  zombie with no legs swimming in a pool .  my favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the gas station .  he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl .   favorite quote  when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie ,  the scientists asks ,   " don't you think that once the ash is in the air ,  it will fall to the ground ,  and contaminate everything ?  "  to which the sargeant boldly replies ,   " now you're talking science fiction .  "  he also continues to mention the  " science fiction "  told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies .   extras :  gallery ,  trailers ,  and interviews ,  most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40% of the scenes ,  yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant details .   bottom line :  a must see for zombie and fulci fans .   rating :  7/10  molly celaschi www . horroryearbook . com myspace . com/horroryearbook
i think this film has much to recommend it ,  particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr .  foxx .  although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very ,  very hard to follow in some cases ,  all in all ,  it makes for a nice time in front of the tube . 
born again is a okay episode of season 1 .  the reincarnation bit ,  in my opinion ,  is cool .  the more i watch it ,  the more i like it ,  yet it will never rise above 'very good' for me .  even though it is not very memorable ,  i'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode .  anyway ,  now i will say what is good and bad about this episode ,   the good :  oragami .  oh yeah !   that fish tank was nice .  =]  thrown out of a window .  very classy .  x]  the bad :  marry your best friend's wife !  ?  o_o  what a random pick to reincarnate .   why didn't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up ,  try to take his scarf off instead ?   conclusion :  okay episode ,  not very memorable .  7/10
hmmm ,  yeah this episode is extremely underrated .   even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts .  i think the good over wins the bad .    i love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end .  i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony .  it's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1 .    for some reason ,  people have always hated the reincarnation episodes ,  yet i have always liked them .  they're not the best ,  in terms of writing .  but the theme really does interest me ,   i'm gonna give it a three star ,  but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four . 
born again the limerick :    if a man could come back from the dead   and live in a little girl's head   revenge he would get   for the murder he met  by the guy that's now in his wife's bed .   for me born again is a highly under-rated ,  classic episode that makes up a part of what defined the x-files for me before i started watching it .  i saw a few segments before when the show first came on and i was much too young to watch it such as parts of the jersey devil ,  but i very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl .  i tell you i couldn't sleep for weeks !  for this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that i have since grown to enjoy .  its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge .  or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night .  you'd think her parents would have been worried .  and maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story .  and was was with the telekinesis ?  other than adding the really cool carrie factor to the already creepy story ,  there really wasn't any kind of good explanation for it .  but even with its little flaws ,  in my mind this is a classic episode and has little to no reason for me to not like it .  10 out of 10 . 
i love cartoons .  they can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more .  they can push the boundaries of satire  ( 'the simpsons' )  ,  good taste  ( 'south park' )  ,  spectacle  ( 'aladdin' )  ,  or reality  ( 'toy story' )  .  there are some good examples of this in 'ice age' ,  such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside ,  chatting like old friends .  such scenes are a pleasure to watch ,  as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time ,  usually in a way that makes us laugh .  while ice age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time ,  it's a really fun film .  sit back ,  enjoy the deliberate anachronisms ,  the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs .   the story follows manfred the grumpy mammoth ,  sid ,  an idiotic sloth ,  and diego ,  a sabretooth tiger ,  as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons .  on the way ,  naturally ,  they have a whole lot of problems .  also popping up throughout the journey is scrat ,  history's unluckiest rodent ,  who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter :  in glaciers ,  on top of dead trees ,  in ice-caves .  his opening scene is a classic .   it's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in ,  but some of the scenes ,  such as the nappy-changing or the dodos ,  are hilarious ,  the animals are likeable and it looks good .  there is one quite touching moment too ,  when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of manfred's eyes .   not a must-see ,  but good for a fun hour or so .   7/10
a glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never-ending wet-slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001 :  a space odyssey .  miles apart in vision ,  but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless .  a magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel-like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn .  you've probably seen this scene in the trailer ,  but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and ,  results ,  an avalanche .  the horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible .    the movie traces two characters ,  a mammoth named manfred  ( ray romano )  and a buck-toothed sloth  ( john leguizamo )  as they try to migrate south .  they find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them .  they are joined by a saber tiger named diego  ( denis leary )  whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan ,  by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap .  diego's meat-eating family wants the mammoth most of all ,  but diego's learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end .    there are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip ,  including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in shrek .  characters contemplate on why they're in the ice age ,  while they could have called it the big chill or the nippy era .  some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming .  another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends :  `all the great guys are never around .  the sensitive ones get eaten . ' throwaway lines galore ,  whimsical comedy and light-fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch .  also ,  food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as `good eating . '   the vocal talents of romano ,  leguizamo and leary make good on their personas ,  while the children will delight in their antics ,  the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents .  there is some mild violence and intense content ,  but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age-old battle of good versus evil ,  and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties .  the animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic .   
*may contain spoilers* *may contain spoilers*  in the age of shrek ( the movie )  & pixar ( the studio )  ,  this is a much more traditional animation film .  it put together some characters that normally wouldn't be seen together ( not to mentioned ,  try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father )  .  they begin as enemies and end as best friend .  if this sound like a disney film ,  it is ( only made through 20th century fox )  .  the trailer to the movie was one of the best i've seen in ages ,  but the movie doesn't live to the expectation the trailer set .  the problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film didn't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film .  yes ,  there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children .  the parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min .  their children's attention is focused on something else than them .  the backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film .  children will love this film ,  adults will only like it . 
there are very few movies that are so funny as this one .  i was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater  " reserved "  for movie buffs like me ,  so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet from drying my eyes .  .  .   at times the story was a bit  " slow "  ,  but that is perhaps for the best - a bit of rest in-between the rolling amongst the aisles  ( i nearly fell out of the seat .  .  .  )  was most welcome . 
i am not going to lie ,  this is a great movie .  i saw it about 4 months ago at my local theatre .  i saw it a second time ,  and i was somewhat bored in the slow scenes .  sid  ( the sloth )  is not all that flattering ,  but diego  ( a mountain lion ,  i think )  is really good in the movie .  the animation is outstanding ,  and the story has a touching ending .  it is worth taking kids 10 and under to ,  but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring .  also ,  the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting .  like i said ,  it is a pretty good movie ,  but i would rate  " toy story 2 "  or  " shrek "  higher .  8/10
ok ,  at the beginning it looked like  " shrek "  - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief .  then it evolves into something really compelling ,  as the gauntlet is set .  and the result is an enjoyable movie ,  which has moments that i agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch  ( manny's past ,  for example )  .  the premise has been obviously worked for a long time ,  so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets  ( only ice caps and rocks )  ,  and three characters .  it's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it .  as i said ,  it can be tear-jerking at some times ,  so ,  kids ,  be warned .  the real letdown is the animation .  this wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek ,  and it shows .  the humans are unrealistic ,  and we have seen better examples of cgi before .  but don't let this stain the record :  as a solo effort ,   " ice age "  is commendable .  and it will gather many fans ,  i have no doubt .  oh and yes ,  the moments with that small mouse are priceless ,  and show-stealing . 
had fun watching this film .  .  despite the feeling i got a lot of the time ,  that this film was almost copying monsters inc .  there're quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two ,  the relationship between an animal/monster and a small child ,  other animals trying to break that relationship ,  etc .  it felt like that pretty much throughout the film ,  to me .   one of the redeeming features though ,  is scrat  :  )  very very funny character ,  even if he serves no purpose  :  ) 
i happened across  " bait "  on cable one night just as it started and thought ,   " eh ,  why not ?  "  i'm glad i gave it a chance .     " bait "  ain't perfect .  it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness .  but overall ,  this movie worked .  all the elements aligned just right ,  and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film .    most of that ,  i think ,  is due to jamie foxx .  i don't know who tagged foxx for the lead ,  but whoever it was did this movie a big favor .  believable and amazingly likeable ,  foxx glides through the movie ,  smooth as butter and funnier than hell .  you can tell he's working on instinct ,  and instinct doesn't fail him .   the plot ,  while unimportant ,  actually ties together pretty well ,  and there's even a character arc through which foxx's character grows as a person .  again ,  they could've slipped by without any of this ,  but it just makes things that much better .   i'm surprised at the low rating for this .  maybe i just caught this move on the right night ,  or vice versa ,  but i'd give it a 7/10 .  bravo ,  mssr .  foxx . 
i looked at this movie with my child eyes ,  and i wasn't disappointed .  the story is well-known ,  some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio  ( mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal )  .  .  .  and i don't want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut .  this one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture .   briefly  :  it works ,  it is funny and it is a  " must-see "  with your children  ( they'll like it )  . 
when i saw the trailers i just had to see the film .  and when i had ,  i kinda had a feeling that felt like unsatisfied .  it was a great movie ,  don't get me wrong ,  but i think the great parts where already in the trailers ,  if you catch my drift .  it went very fast and it rolled on ,  so i was never bored ,  and i enjoyed watching it .  the humor was absolutely great .  my first contact with a sloth  (  .  . or something like it )  . 
an interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger ,  a sloth ,  and a mammoth ,  who saved a baby ,  who was close to be killed by a group of tigers during the ice age .  the morale of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end .  one of the tigers in the group got an order to finally capture the baby ,  who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community .  the baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth ,  but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby .  they went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger ,  and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth .  at the end the group of tigers tried to capture the baby but the mammoth helped incredibly by his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and to give the baby back to his father and the community to which he belongs . 
shrek ,  anyone ?  well ,  imagine shrek in the ice age .  remember the ending of shrek ?  of cause you do .  now ,  imagine ,  that shrek turns into a human ,  and so does the princess .  get it ?  nice animation ,  actually ,  much more of an art work than pixar and disney pictures ,  which are trying to get as close to reality as possible in their drawings .  strong one-liners ,  some social comments that kids won't understand ,  the good guys win .  one thing more :  scrat .  by the way ,  how does everybody know his name is scrat ?  7/10
no day passes without a new released computer animated movie ,  so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects .  after watching ice age i felt that's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre .   but it's because i am a big guy now ,  and i am pretty sure that this is a very enjoyable movie for children  ( maybe up to 14 )  .  the story is quite simple ,  and the  " actors "  are funny in a cute way ,  without any crude or complex humour .  even the  " evil "  is lovely ,  fluffy big cat with those funny teeth .  and the story has a happy end ,  which was a small disappointment for me  ( knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way )  but a great thing for children .  and apart from some fights nobody dies  ( not even when he gets stomped on by a mammoth ,  several times )  ,  which made a cartoony feeling .   the computer animation part is nice but nothing special ,  apart from some really nice cartoony feeling scenes ,  when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics .  [which means lots of work nevertheless ! ]  there were some gags which made me smile - i accept ,  the creators tried to satisfy those grownups - but they are hard to spot and  ( in my opinion )  better left unnoticed ,  since it does not feel to fit into the story .   overall it's a nice movie ,  but it's rather in the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-children disney cliche .  if you don't hate cute animals making funny things ,  watch it at least once . 
the movie itself was ok for the kids .  but i gotta tell ya that scratch ,  the little squirrel ,  was the funniest character i've ever seen .  he makes the movie all by himself .  he's the reason i've just love this movie .  congradulations to the crew ,  it made me laugh out loud and always will ! 
i can't stand it when people go see a movie when they know they won't like it .  my mom likes violent movies ,  so why did she see it ?  she rated it just to bring down the rating .  so i know that's why it didn't have a higher rating .  i give it a 6/10
this is my first cg animated film that i've ever seen .  usually ,  the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them .  not ice age .  i wanted to see it the moment i saw the trailer with scrat ,  the hilarious sabertooth squirrel .   ice age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch .  the story is basically an animated version of three men and a baby ,  set 20 , 000 years in the past .  the visuals were great .  simply beautiful .  it's one thing to create convincing aninmation ,  it's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and ice age is great to look at with its stylized visuals .  blue sky studios is a company to look out for in the future . 
 ( spoilers ?  ?  )   i wasn't sure what to think of the movie .  not too much of a kids film .  definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying .  but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by it .   i was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had .   ( even less without the credits )  and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature .  but alas ,  they torture him .  right until the end of the movie .  those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars .  but i do recommend the movie .  even for a sequel .   8/10  quality :  9/10 entertainment :  7/10 replayable : 7/10
while i loved this movie ,  the trailers that circulated the internet the year before it hit theaters set my expectations a bit high .   i own the dvd ,  so don't get me wrong ,  i am not saying don't watch it or even buy it !  it's just that i still think the first scene was the best ,  and nothing throughout the entire movie ever topped it . 
this film resembles in many ways `enemy of the state' with will smith and gene hackman ,  as we have an innocent  ( black )  man being pursued by the `government' with all the modern technology known to man .  usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster .  that does not apply here .  of course i love everything david morse does ,  so maybe my comments are not fair ,  but there were more good things about this film then that .  the main baddy ,  played by doug hutchison ,  was brilliant ,  and the story flowed with excellent extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli .  our hero ,  alvin sanders  ( played by jamie foxx )  ,  was however irritating most of the part .  he is so out of place ,  cracking bad jokes ,  evoking no sympathy from the audience .  or not to begin with ,  the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you  ( and on his followers as well !  )  .  i didn't expect much when i rented it ,  but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits .  7/10
i wouldn't go so far as to not recommend this movie ,  since the only problems i have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems .  that doesn't make it bad ,  just not something i'd go far .   it is a little saccharine ,  so i might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for-kids movie like this .   however ,  all of that goes out the window when that squirrel  ( the one in all the trailers )  comes on-screen .  his time is limited ,  but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys 'hey ,  could you stick in a little more squirrel ? ' every time it's getting intolerably dull .  that doesn't save the movie ,  but you can leave saying 'at least there was one aspect where i couldn't stop laughing . '  and of course ,  visually it won't disappoint ,  but that's almost a given with pixar flicks .  of all of their stuff ,  i'd put this at the bottom .  .  . but that isn't in itself bad . 
ice age is not only animation of the year  ( in my eyes )  it's also the best animated feature i've ever seen !   the teaser excited me last year and i've spent many happy hours on the website .  scrat is cool !  and so are the rest of the sub zero heroes .   the animation is superb .  your heart really goes out to the characters in this film .  they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed .  it's hard to say which one really steals the picture .   i experienced their journey with laughter ,  tears and amazement .  nothing was forced or over done .  the emotion was genuine ,  especially in the dramatic second half .  the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in 1997 ,  also a fox production .  and before that it was the land before time 1988 .  all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience ,  not just the cynics .  10/10   
this movie had no parts that were hilarious ,  mostly just average funny units ,  but it did not have any parts that were really bad either .  the worst part was the voice of sid .  his slothy slur was just too much for me .  by about 5 minutes in i was sick of hearing him talk .  aside from the annoying sloth voice the movie was good .  there were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better .  this is a good movie for kids .  it has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids .  this one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them . 
if you like jamie foxx ,  ( alvin sanders )  ,  " date from hell "  , '01 ,  you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with shrimp ,   ( jumbo size )  and at the same time lots of gold bars .  alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw ,  and david morse ,  ( edgar clenteen )  ,   " hack "  '02 tv series ,  decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals .  there is lots of laughs ,  drama ,  cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard .  jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture . 
 " ice age "  is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by blue sky studios and released in 2002 as the company's first .  we are introduced to the main characters :  a squirrel named scrat  ( voiced by chris wedge ,  and please note :  the sound of scrat's screams is the sound of tom's screams from the  " tom and jerry "  cartoons )  ,  a woolly mammoth named manny  ( voiced by ray romano of  " everybody loves raymond "  )  ,  a sloth named sid  ( voiced by john leguizamo of  " titan a .  e .  "  )  ,  and a saber toothed tiger named diego  ( voiced by denis leary of pixar's  " a bug's life "  )  .   the movie opens with scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that ,  he caused an avalanche .  we then see a herd going south for the coming ice age  ( except for manny ,  who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him )  .  sid comes out of his cave yawning ,  and saw that his family abandoned him .  he then pays toll with some aardvarks .  unfortunately ,  he gets pursued by sylvia  ( voiced by kirsten johnston of  " 3rd rock from the sun "  )  ,  a female orange sloth ,  who wants sid to go migrating with her .  sid eventually teams up with manny ,  and they became friends .   meanwhile ,  nearby a human tribe ,  soto  ( voiced by goran visnjic )  ,  an evil saber toothed tiger ,  wants revenge against the tribe's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son ,  roshan ,  away from him .  in the morning ,  he ,  diego ,  and soto's henchmen ,  lenny  ( voiced by alan tudyk )  ,  oscar  ( voiced by diedrich bader )  ,  and zeke  ( voiced by jack black )  attacked the tribe ,  but the leader's wife escaped with roshan and gave him to manny and sid to look after .  eventually ,  diego joins them ,  and went on a journey to return roshan back to his tribe ,  who are also looking for him as well .  relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out ,  okay ?  besides manny ,  sid ,  diego ,  scrat ,  sylvia ,  and roshan ,  the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that roshan's tribe are using ,  and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named jennifer  ( voiced by jane krakowski )  ,  and a skinny female yellow sloth named rachel  ( voiced by lorri bagley )  ,  to whom sid shows them roshan as they relax in a tar pit .  incidentally ,  the two rhinos ,  carl  ( voiced by cedric the entertainer of pdi's  " madagascar "  )  ,  and frank  ( voiced by stephen root of pixar's  " finding nemo "  )  ,  who go after sid for ruining their meal and confront manny on a cliff ,  are simple minor characters .  same went for the dodos ,  who are using melons as their food supply .   the gags in this movie are very funny .  for instance ,  manny talks through his trunk saying ,   " i'm not going !  "  when jennifer and rachel are out of the tar pit ,  sid asks jennifer  " what do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens ?  "  jennifer then responds to him ,   " what do you say if you go jump into the tar pit !  ?  "  rachel also then kicks sid in the waist .  sylvia sees diego holding sid by the neck with his teeth ,  then she asks sid if he's holding his breath ,  tells diego to eat him ,  and promptly walks off .   since  " ice age "  is not only a success ,  but it has 2 sequels :  the first one was  " ice age :  the meltdown "  ,  which was released in 2006 ,  and the other was  " ice age :  dawn of the dinosaurs "  ,  which is going to be releasing next year .  i can hardly die waiting to see what  " ice age :  dawn of the dinosaurs "  will be like . 
finally i got to see the infamous  " ice age "  .  apart from maybe not being as dead funny as i'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word i can say about it .  sure ,  it's not as glamorous as a disney production ( besides ,  it is fox's 1st attempt at a full length cg movie )  but it's got immense heart and on some occasions ( like the look in manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past )  i found myself on the verge of tears .  but when they reunited the baby with its father i just couldn't hold them in anymore .  a movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and cliché and manages to bring more than the best out of it ;  the end result being one of the most touching animated creations i have ever seen .  great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you ( and great voice talents as well )  and many funny memorable scenes ,  especially from scrat's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go .  plus the dodo scene ,  which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002 .   i honestly don't get it ,  but for some reason it really looks like cg animation will be taking the upper hand in the future .  but if it just means that there will be more movies like this one  ( and who can forget pixar's creations )  then i don't really mind ,  at least for now .  9/10
i thought that ice age was an excellent movie !  as a woman of 30 ,  with no children ,  i still seem to really enjoy these humorous ,  witty animated movies .  sid is the best character i have seen in some time ,  better than bartok in anastasia  ( although he was really humorous ,  and i did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten )  and even more humorous than melman in madagascar .  i have seen the movie at least 15 times  ( i own it obviously )  and i quote the movie at work  ( on many occasions .  .  . yes , still )  .  my favourite scene is the part where sid says  " oh ,  oh ,  oh ,  i love this game !  "  and sid and manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the  " tigers "  .  .  .  " pack of wolves ,  pack of bears ,  pack of fleas ,  pack of whiskers ,  pack of noses ,  pack a derm ?  ,  pack of lies ,  pack of troubles ,  pack a wallop ,  pack of birds ,  pack of flying fish .  .  .  "  or however that part goes !  that is the funniest part about the whole movie ,  although i also really enjoyed the humour behind  " putting sloths on the map "  and many other parts as well .  the only animated movie that can remotely compare to ice age is  " brother bear "  . 
i watched 'ice age'in the movie theater and i liked the movie .  spite of the fact that 'ice age'has many flaws and scientific errors , like humans , sabers , dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same period ,  and even the location of where the story passes ( looks north america , but has some characteristics from iceland for example )  we can have fun even so .  ( unless you are very severe !  )    the planet is entering an ice age ,  and many animals are immigrating to the south where is warmer .  sid is a stupid sloth that is left behind by his own family ,  that can't stand him any longer . walking in his way ,  he meets manfred , or how he calls '' manny'' a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and is going to the north .  worried that he can easily be captured ,  sid decides to follow manfred ,  and in the middle of their journey ,  they found a human mother with her baby .  the mother dies but manfred and sid decides to take him and return the baby for the humans .  diego ,  one of the sabers ,  decides to follow and help them to go to a shortcut to the human's camp .  what manfred and sid does not know ,  is that diego is from a saber clan who hates humans and wants to kill the baby ,  and also pretend to betray they both to make they become saber's food .  what will happen ,  will depend of diego's behavior and conscience .  .  .   aka  " a era do gelo "  - brazil
i saw the movie with two grown children .  although it was not as clever as shrek ,  i thought it was rather good .  in a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break ,  there was not a sound so i know the children all liked it .  there parents also seemed engaged .  the death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments .  hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids .  as such ,  it was successful although i liked it too .  personally i liked the scrat !  ! 
just saw ice age ,  a very funny and especially nice looking film .  the story is simple but effective ,  the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design .   more inspired by traditional animated movies than reality ,  the designs give you a really ,  really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour .  sometimes the touches of reality shine through  ( especially the water was impressive )  ,  but nonetheless ,  it's a fantasy-world based on reality .  including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering .   pixar films shine with technical brilliance ,  this one shines with effective uses of technical know-how .   enough technical babble ,  the film's entertaining ,  family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny . 
i first saw ice age in the subiaco cinemas when it came out ,  back in '02 .  i was only 13 at the time ,  but even then i liked it .  it had some sort of warmth .   we've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it ,  it never gets boring .  this is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3d animations made at the time - the characters have no particular 'home' which they leave .  they are nomads ,  and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch .   also ,  each individual character on the surface ,  appear to be just putting up with each other ,  but they're really all good friends .  as well ,  all of the characters have their own charms  ( even the bad guys )  .  sid the sloth is charming in his annoying ,  over-affectionate and naive sort of way .  manny is adorable in his depressed ,  reclusive character ,  and so on and so forth .   another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation .  all the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay ,  giving the film an artistic edge .   another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie ,  is that gender means very little .  there are hardly any female characters ,  but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film .  due to this ,  there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age .   all in all ,  ice age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before shrek 2 and the incredibles came out . 
this is obviously aimed at the same market as monsters inc and shrek ,  but is different in its less cartoony feel  ( despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures )  .  the story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end  ( its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves )  but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different  " animals .  "  you know the outcome ,  but you can't help being drawn in .    the characters themselves are far more than their voices  ( the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices )  ,  unlike most disney movies .  they are well rounded and completely believable ,  strangely .  the group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable .  you will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think .    the animation is brilliant ,  as you would expect ,  and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie .  you will fall in love with the characters ,  especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts .  i came out wanting the obligatory merchandise ,  especially the sloth toy ,  only to be disappointed the next day when i couldn't find anything vaguely related .   which ,  strangely ,  makes the movie all the more pure .    better than monsters inc or shrek . 
i'd have to say this is one of the best animated films i've ever seen .  i liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing ,  just a few weeks ago .  i can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office .  apparently ,  a lot of people liked this movie .   a gorgeous color palette  ( man ,  this looks good )  and a lot of good adult  ( but clean )  humor make this a big winner .  the opening 3-4-minute scene with  " scat ,  "  is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him .   " sid "  the sloth  ( voiced by john leguizano )  ,  however ,  provides the main humor in the movie .  he usually has something funny to say throughout the movie .   ray romano is the voice of the mammoth ,  the big character of the film ,  literally ,  while denis leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tiger  this isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice ,  sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters .  this isn't interrupted with a lot of songs ,  either :  one only brief one and there is nothing offensive ,  language-wise .   if more animated movies were this good ,  i'd own more . 
with a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $60 million the people at fox animation and blue sky studios have done an incredible job .   they have combined state-of-the-art digital animation ,  the perfectly cast voice talents of ray romano ,  john leguizamo and dennis leary  ( among many others )  to create a highly entertaining ,  family film with a strong message about cooperation ,  friendship and caring for your fellow herd members .  and how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd .   while watching this film i got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders !   david newman -- yet another member of the newman family of hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and ,  at times ,  is positively toe tapping .   the overall look of the film is incredible ;  an intensely coloured ,  strangely believable fantasyland of snow ,  geysers ,  mud ,  rocks and ice .  the individual characters were delightfully believable too ,  with the facial expressions of ray romano's manfred' being a particular treat .   the entire sequence with the dodos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `dumb as a dodo comes from . '  this is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless .   it would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home . 
return to the lost world was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 version of the lost world .   in this sequel ,  the same five people ,  lead by challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land .  gomez has something to do with this .  they manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved ,  much to the delight of the natives .   like in the lost world ,  what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a t-rex and ankylosaurus .   john ryhs-davies and david warner reprise their roles as challenger and summerlee and three of the other actors are also back .   despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs ,  i enjoyed return to the lost world .   rating :  3 stars out of 5 . 
once again the two bickering professors must join together to save the lost world .  the five members of the first expedition return  ( see the lost world ,  1992 ,  for a list of actors )  .  a man seeking oil brings a drilling crew to the plateau .  instead of striking oil they tap an underground volcano which threatens all life in the lost world .  the oil crew clash with the native people and the scientific expedition .  although the situation looks hopeless .  .  .  .   ( i'm not going to tell you the ending )  . 
lily mars ,  a smalltown girl living in indiana ,  dreams of making it big on broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful broadway producer john thornway returns to his hometown for a visit .  lily tries everything she can to get thornway to notice her ,  but he just gets annoyed with her antics .  when thornway goes back to new york to stage his show ,  lily follows  ( unknown to john of course )  and thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show ,  only as a favor to her family ,  however thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms ,  which makes the show's leading lady ,  isabel rekay ,  jealous .  when isabel gets fed up with the john-lily romance causing friction with the show ,  she leaves ,  and john decides to make lily the star .  isabel returns later ,  and thornway is forced to tell lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play ,  which also may jeopardize the romance .  very charming film ,  and a refreshing change to see garland put the comedic touches into her role  ( her reading of lady macbeth ,  while supposed to be humorous ,  never threatened her singing career )  i enjoyed heflin's character  ( thornway )  more when he was annoyed with lily rather than be the romantic .  the film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren't assembled that well together ,  but a very enjoyable film .  rating ,  7 . 
in this 1943 film ,  judy garland is deemed not to be ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-van heflin .  this film was certainly a big change for mr .  heflin ,  especially after his supporting oscar win the year before in  " johnny eager .  "   wasn't spring byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children ,  with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren ?   the singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between heflin and garland was depicted left a lot to be desired .  it was a gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer . 
presenting lily mars  ( mgm ,  1943 )  is a cute film ,  but in my opinion it could have been better .  judy garland is great as always ,  but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and van heflin develops all too quickly .   i mean ,  one minute he's ready to beat her butt ,  but the next minute he falls in love with her .  i believe that this production ,  the film editing ,  and the script  (  even though the photography was great ,  the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well )  could have been a little better .  it feels as though the production was too rushed .    the supporting cast was good as well ,  especially little janet chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter rosie .  she at the age of 11 ,  looks really cute and it's a shame that she didn't develop into a teenage comic actress .  she's much better in this film than in her previous films as warner brothers in the late 1930's  ( except for broadway musketeers 1938 ,  she's really good in that )  ,  when they tried to make her into a shirley temple/sybil jason hybrid .  overall ,  this film could better ,  but in the end ,  judy gave it her all . 
presenting lily mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress judy garland ,  along with her standard singing moments .  the plot consists of lily mars tagging along after producer john thornway for her big break .  i think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here .  i really recommend this film for everyone .  judy is breathtaking in this role ! 
  presenting lily mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system .  ok now that you know my bias ,  here are some reasons i think this movie does stand out .   1 .  although the basic plot - lily mars  ( judy garland )  goes to new york ,  becomes a star ,  and wins the heart of her director  ( van heflin )  is a pretty stock hollywood story of the period ,  the writers do vary the theme her a bit more than usual .  although lily gets her big break when the star quits ,  she isn't successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show .   2 .  judy garland  ( enough said !  )   3 .  the supporting cast includes some really great performances .  spring byington as lily's mother is truely wonderful ,  as is fay bainter  ( the mother of the director - john thornway  ( van heflin )  )  .  the standout supporting performance though goes to character actress connie gilchrist as frankie ,  a one time actress turned theater custodian .   worth a watch for sure .  one of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams . 
almost every review of this movie i'd seen was pretty bad .  it's not pretty bad ,  it's actually pretty good ,  though not great .  the judy garland character could have gotten annoying ,  but she didn't allow it to .  somewhere along the line ,  i've become a fan of brooding ,  overbearing ,  overacting van heflin ,  at least in the early 40's .  judy's singing is great ,  but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship .  i gave it a 7 . 
the movie is great and i like the story .  i prefer this movie than other movie such the cell  (  sick movie  )  and highlander  (  silly movie  )  .  i just tell the truth ,  i like a reality hehe and also a true story  :  )   
presenting lily mars may have provided judy garland with one of the easier roles she had while at mgm because lily mars is definitely a character she could identify with .  a young girl with talent enough for ten ,  she knows she has what it takes to make it in the theater no matter how much producer van heflin from her home town discourages her .   i really liked judy in this one as the girl determined to make it in the theater .  because it is judy garland with the talent of judy garland you in the audience know she has the right stuff even if it takes van heflin nearly the whole movie to be convinced .   both judy and heflin hail from the same small town ,  heflin's dad was the town doctor who delivered her and heflin while he may have moved away and become a big producer on broadway ,  their respective moms ,  fay bainter and spring byington have kept in touch .  that's her entrée ,  but heflin's constantly barraged with stagestruck kids ,  but never anyone quite like lily mars .   no real big song hits came out of presenting lily mars for garland ,  though she sings all her numbers .  the best in the film is a revival of that gaslight era chestnut ,  every little movement has a meaning all its own .  judy sings it with connie gilchrist playing the cleaning lady in a broadway theater where heflin's show is being produced .  gilchrist was a star back in the days of the floradora girls and she and judy deliver the song in grand style with connie .  it's the best scene in the film as gilchrist encourages judy to keep at it .  composer karl hoschna had died a long time ago ,  but lyricist otto harbach was still alive and i'm betting he liked what he heard .   european musical star marta eggerth is in presenting lily mars as the show's star who's at first bemused ,  then angry and finally ,  understanding of garland and heflin .  she did a couple of films with mgm and then went back to europe for more work on the continent .  i'm betting mgm didn't quite know what to do with her and her thick hungarian accent ,  though louis b .  mayer never met a soprano he didn't like .   van heflin does well as the patient producer who puts up with a lot from garland and eggerth .  heflin was just coming off his oscar for johnny eager the previous year and he and garland wouldn't appear to be an ideal screen team ,  but they're not bad together .   presenting lily mars is a fine showcase for the talents of judy garland .  and she didn't have to share the screen in another backstage film with mickey rooney . 
this film was made in 1943 when i think judy was at her peak  ( looks wise )  .  in her previous film for me and my gal people often say that she looks emaciated .  well in this film she looks perfect .  she is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy .   i think this film is hilarious ,  especially at the beginning when she is trying to arrange an audition with john thornway .  one of the funniest scene's in my opinion is judy's rendition of lady macbeth and when john is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking  ( lol )  .   one criticism i do have is that there is a hole in the plot when john and lily fall in love .  i mean one minute he despises her and the next they are going out on a date then the next time they meet after that date they are in love .   another point i didn't like was on opening night .  if i were lily i would be furious with john but she isn't .  .  . it just doesn't make sense .   but all in all i would have to give this film a 10 because it is just wonderful and almost perfect . 
in the hollywood west those trail hands were a rough bunch who when they came to town ,  partied pretty hardy .  after all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day before railroads got to all parts of the usa .    the drovers who worked for trail boss gil favor as played by eric fleming were no different .  but fleming was a man of all business ,  he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it .    with the long run of rawhide and the fact that the regulars stayed with it for the most part ,  we got to know all the drovers at some point .  a some point story lines were focused around all of them ,  though the bulk were with fleming and clint eastwood's character rowdy yates ,  the number 2 guy with the herd .   clint eastwood's western image was molded by rawhide ,  it's a shame that these are not shown more often .  probably because they were done in black and white .  had this been an nbc show ,  this would have been done in color like bonanza and be running as often as those shows are .  we'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend .   ironically enough it was eric fleming who left the show before it closed to do films .  he did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name .  sadly he was killed on a movie location doing an action film ,  drowned in a river .  had he lived he might have become a name like eastwood's .   clint took over as trail boss in the last season and then the show completed its run .  and he of course became the icon he is today and not just in the western genre .   rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it .  no frills in this one ,  these were working cowboys just doing a job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year .   they really don't make television series like these any more .  what a pity . 
currently on metoo's new schedule at 4 pm on weekdays ,  right after  " maverick "  and right before  " wild ,  wild west "   ( followed by  " star trek "  )  .   don't know if i ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on ,  but i'm really captivated by it .  offbeat ,  unusual ,  surreal stories set in a mythical west .  kind of the  " naked city "  of westerns .   and the guest stars are there :  dan duryea ,  lyle bettger ,  brian donlevy ,  macdonald carey ,  rick jason  ( as a treacherous mexican )  ,  a young dick van patten ,  jack lord ,  noah berry ,  jr .   ( as a colorful mexican )  ,  martha hyer ,  marguerite chapman ,  even ann robinson  (  " war of the worlds "  )  ,  gloria talbott  (  " i married a monster from outer space "  )   it ran for eight seasons ,  over 200 episodes ,  from january ,  1959 ,  to december ,  1965 .   eric fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss gil favor ,  the most stolid man that's ever lived ,  with the code of honor of a samurai ,  and just the right balance between toughness and open-handedness .  i would vote for him for president any day .   ( p . s .  he had a very interesting biography :  http : //www . imdb . com/name/nm0281661/  )   and a young clint eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand ,   " rowdy "  yates .  also ,  veteran western actor and country music figure  ( the immortal  " one-eyed ,  one-horned ,  flying purple people eater "  )  sheb wooley is there as seasoned scout pete nolan .  and paul brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as  " wishbone "  .   and then there's that great theme song ,  performed by the immortal frankie laine .   ( between that and the  " maverick "  theme ,  i've got western theme songs running through my head all day .  )   i look forward to every episode ;  i'm collecting the whole set .  a good time  ( not to mention a moo-ving experience )  is always guaranteed ,  as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial .    " rollin' ,  rollin' ,  rollin'  .   .   .   " 
it ran 8 seasons ,  but it's first ,  in early 1959 ,  and it's last ,  in the autumn of 1965 ,  were shorter than seasons 2-7 .  cbs chief william paley canceled rawhide's production after watching the 1st show of season 8 ,  in september ,  1965 ,  because he disliked the series without eric fleming as gil favor ,  who had departed after season 7 .  the last new episode aired in november ,  1965 .  the lone 1966 cbs broadcast ,  on january 4 ,  1966 ,  was a rerun .    i have often wondered why rawhide didn't switch to color filming for it's last season ?  most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965 .  cbs was broadcasting in color that autumn ,  for many of their sitcoms ,  but westerns like gunsmoke and rawhide remained in black and white .  gunsmoke was the last western  ( and last prime time network series to switch to color )  on september 17 ,  1966 ,  for the episode snap decision . 
rawhide was a wonderful tv western series .  focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss gil favor .  most episodes - especially from the first 3 seasons were really character studies of favor and his men .  guest stars came and went but unlike wagon train they seldom dominated the episodes they appeared in .  rawhide was a true ,  gritty western and gil favor stood out as a memorable character never to be forgotten .  thanks to eric fleming's performance the show became a massive hit .  of course he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors - clint eastwood ,  sheb wooley ,  paul brinegar ,  steve raines ,  james murdoch ,  rocky shahan ,  robert cabal .  all of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history .  rawhide captured the flavour of that time of the west that no other series has for me ,  as yet anyhow ,  managed to do so .  later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines .  for me some of the time this didn't work - the cattle drive and the regulars provided the best stories .  however there were still some classic stories and rawhide remained top drawer affair .  the black and white photography added to a bleak ,  realistic feel that other western series seldom managed to capture .  rustlers ,  indians , commancheroes ,  beautiful damsels in distress ,  serial killers ,  they all showed up to give our heroes problems .  the end came for the series quietly when the final season was axed less than half way through .  the reason - eric fleming had departed and rawhide was now a head without a body - the gritty realism was gone ,  gil favor commanded respect and exuded authority - he was never infallible and this made him all the more interesting .  we shall not see his like again .  watch an episode whenever you can ,  they seldom disappoint . 
young erendira and her tyrranical grandmother provide for a great fantasy from the new world .  this interpretation of gabriel garcia marquez' " la incréible y triste historia da la cándida eréndira ,  .  .  .  "  may not rub marquez purists the right way eventhough the story stays intact and still carries the full force of the work .  the strength of this film is in its acting especially papas as the grandmother .  marquez fans and marquez novices alike will enjoy this movie for its real gritty brand of witt . 
this is a gorgeous movie visually .  the images of the mexican desert ,  the old mansion ,  the characters in their picturesque costumes .  .  . all amount to a real work of art .   the story seems a bit loose ,  but that's because it's not meant to be realistic .  it is taken from a book called one hundred years of solitude ,  and it is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated ,  otherworldly atmosphere of latin america  " so far from god ,  and so close to the united states "  .  the tremendous debt that erendira owes to her grandmother is symbolic of latin america's international debt burden ,  although there many layers of meaning .   if you can appreciate a slow-moving ,  richly-textured movie ,  this one is for you . 
 " erendira "  is a film from mexico that is rarely talked about .  the film only exists in a low quality vhs format .  it's a shame this film hasn't been given a dvd release .   " erendira "  is stunning and gorgeous with its magic-realist images .   " erendira "  is based on a short story from the novel  " 100 years of solitude "  .  erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandma's house .  her evil grandma ,  played by irene papas ,  forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages .  the whole town gets a piece of erendira ,  so to speak .  although the subject matter sounds harsh ,  the film doesn't exploit sexuality .  it's done in a mature artistic manner .  the film also has some amazing costumes .  some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most ,  are the origami birds that morph into real birds ,  and a golden orange with a diamond in the center .  erendira is an amazing film ,  that even manages to throw in humor .  this is definitely a film that deserves a special dvd release .  as they'd say in espanol ,   " es muy muy bien  !  !  !  excellente ! 
although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism ,  it is in fact nothing of the sort .  it is a political and cultural allegory of mexico's post-columbian odyssey ,  as even a passing glance at mexico's history will attest .    in contrast to  " like water for chocolate ,  "   " erendira "  expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work .   ( a good starting point is to see the grandmother character as spain :  proud ,  aloof ,  sorrowful and ,  above all else ,  weighed-down-with-history .  )   the ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the  " outcome "  of history  ( i . e .  the present )  is always obscure ,  since we are too close to it for honest evaluation .  refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director ,  given the ambitions of the film .    " erendira "  is gorgeous .  a big-screen experience would be ideal ,  if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening .  but if not ,  vhs is better than never seeing it at all . 
i liked this movie .  when the guy who was in on a bank heist of $40 million in gold dies ,  his cell mate is used as  " bait "  to lead them to the high-tech crazy killer partner  ( by having a monitoring device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge )  .  it's an action ,  spy type film with enough comical scenes to keep it light .  it reminded me of enemy of the state .  well acted and good enough plot . 
read eric's review again .  he perfectly described my own feeling for this film so more eloquently than i ever could .  i'm only writing here to further encourage you to look for and see it .   i saw it many years ago on tv ,  the ifc i think .  it is such a unique film i hesitate to make comparisons .  it was filmed in northern mexico ,  somewhere in the relentless badlands of coahuila/zacatecas/san luis potosi .  this isn't the sedona-like durango , mexico  ( of the john wayne films )  but a truly stark and wild place .  i have to find the novel now to check on the original location of the story .  like the location ,  this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and weird and absolutely not for everyone .  it is the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film .   i hadn't actually forgotten this movie ,  it is indelible .  yet ,  over the years ,  i had forgotten of its existence .  i know nobody who has seen it ,  had never read of it ,  nor seen any reference to it .  erendira is such an unusual name ,  i'd even forgotten the title .  well ,  i'll be looking to buy a copy now .   **i have since the above posting become a huge fan of gabriel garcia marquez and so regret not having read him before .   relative to msmyth's comment below ;  the movie was filmed in mexico but the author is colombian and was not commenting on mexico or mexican history in any way ,  although marquez now lives in mexico for  " political "  reasons .  this story is universal .    i am still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library .  liked the movie ?  you have to read the story and then everything else garcia marquz wrote .  and ,  by the way ,  the original location in the story was colombia . 
unfortunately ,  this movie never made it to dvd .  i saw it when it was first released to the theaters in 1983 ,  and then again when the vhs was released in 1992 .  when i recently saw a vhs copy at a flea market ,  i immediately bought it .  i was not disappointed .  first ,  the obvious :  claudia ohana is beautiful and a joy to behold .  but then ,  the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values and decide what is really important to you .  the movie is about a lot of things .  it is about how the world bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt that they can never repay .  it is about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us into debt with credit cards ,  mortgage ,  and car payment .  it is about trying to save an innocence that maybe we have never really had and maybe we cannot really save .  it is about good and evil and about how hard it is sometimes to tell one from the other .  it raises a lot of questions but does not give answers .  i think sometimes this is good .  for this reason ,  this is a film really worth saving and seeing . 
i first rented this film many years ago ,  and was completely enthralled by it .  just recently ,  feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way-too-few films that i've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime ,  i decided to give  " erendira "  another look .  and i'm glad i did ,  as i soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film .   the story is about a teenaged girl  ( erendira ,  played remarkably by claudia o'hana - in some respects she resembles winona ryder !  )  who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion after which the grandmother ,  played downright hypnotically by irene papas ,  forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages .    the viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though ,  inspite of the basic premise ,  which deals with prostitution ,  is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content .  the story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother ,  and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn - which ,  by the way ,  is in the rough and tumble part of rural mexico .   the film is very atmospheric ,  arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality .  it sometimes borders on the bizarre ,  but not to the point of ,  say ,  a david lynch film .  it's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature ,  read the comments from previous viewers below .  .  .   often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion ,  quiet and melancholy ,  adding just the right musical accents to highlight the mexican setting .  the cinematography of the rural places ,  many of which are in the desert ,  is quite superb .   the film moves at a nice pace ,  neither too fast nor too slow ,  and after every scene i felt i had to rewind the tape and play it over again ,  just because it makes you want to do that .  for me anyway ,  it really is that compelling .   hopefully you will see the film in its spanish language version ,  with subtitles .  i studied spanish in high school as well as in college ,  and i was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue .  por ejemplo :   " el mundo no es tan grande como pensaba .  "   (  " the world's not as big as i thought "  - i . e .  ,  it's a small world .  )   this film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine ,  which ,  upon drinking ,  is immensely satisfying ,  however ,  you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one . 
this movie is such cheesy goodness .   a bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school .  they start getting killed off ,  they know they are being stalked ,  so what do they do ?  one girl decides to take a bath ,  another decides to cheat on her husband  ( who is also there )  with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed  ( in an old abandoned school ?  )  and go at it .   and it comes through with the gore and the t&a .   and it's also interesting from a historical/sociological point of view .  where the usual 80's slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves ,  or how adults view young people ,  or as hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective .  this is a brit film made to be an american slasher .  it's hilarious to see how often the british actors who are trying to speak  " american "  unintentionally slip back in to their uk accents .   if you like cheesy 80's slashers  ( like pieces )  then you will like this one . 
poor geeky marty  ( simon scuddamore )  gets horribly burned due to a cruel april fool's day stunt gone very wrong .  flash forward a decade and those involved  ( including caroline monroe ,  known to horror fans for her turns in maniac ,  faceless & the last horror film )  in the prank are psyched for the upcoming 10 year high school reunion not aware that a court jester-masked killer is hiding out in the  ( now closed down )  school and out for revenge .   chaulk this one up to being a guilty pleasure ,  i knew it's a bad film .  it has all the characteristics of one .  yet there's just something about it that makes me feel compelled to watch it from time to time  ( preferably with beer in hand )  .  i'm even willing to overlook the absolutely horrid ending  ( which ,  i do have to say ,  i hate )  i guess i like it because it has a fun atmosphere about it and some pretty cool kills .   eye candy  ( for the men )  :  josephine scandi & donna yeager both get topless   eye candy  ( for the ladies )  :  a gratuitous cock shot of simon scuddamore at the start of the film   my grade :  b-   lionsgate dvd extras :  optional trivia track ;  trailer for this film ;  and trailers for my bloody valentine  ( 1981 )  ,  monster squad ,  dirty dancing
 " slaughter high "  is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd marty , who gets pick on all the time by some pranksters . the prank goes wrong and he ends up getting savagely burned . five years later his tormentors all attend a reunion-just the ten of them of course , and low and behold marty murders them one after another . british actress caroline munro (  " maniac "  ) leads the cast as the heroine ( who dies anyway !  )  . the acting is completely awful , there's also no suspense at all . plenty of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore-freaks : a guy's stomach explodes , another female victim literally gets an acid bath , a couple having sex in bed get electrocuted , a guy is crushed by a tractor , one girl is drowned , and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye . the killer wears a decent and rather creepy jester's mask and the setting ( a beautiful old english castle ) is really nice . however the dream finale is utterly pathetic . all in all it's true that  " slaughter high "  is a piece of garbage , but i enjoyed it . only for fans of truly bad slasher flicks . 
a bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy marty  ( a sympathetic performance by simon scuddamore )  which leaves him hideously disfigured .  five years later the gang returns to the now crumbling and abandoned high school for a reunion .  of course ,  an angry and vindictive marty shows up dressed in a jester's costume to exact a grisly revenge on his tormentors .  writers/directors mark ezra ,  peter litten and george dugdale trot out all the endearingly corny clichés which make these 80's slice'n'dice body count flicks so much cheesy fun :  fake jump scares ,  prowling steadican shots ,  a fierce storm ,  an insanely groovy hard rock soundtrack ,  a nice smattering of gratuitous female nudity ,  a totally ridiculous  " what the hell ?  "  supernatural climax ,  tacky make-up f/x ,  and one of those lovably lame  " it was all just a terrible dream "  fake-out non-endings .  moreover ,  the elaborate murder set pieces deliver the gruesome goods :  gory highlights include a man's stomach exploding after he drinks poisoned beer ,  a lady taking an acid bath ,  a guy being crushed under a huge tractor ,  and two people getting electrocuted while in the middle of having wild passionate sex .  thirtyish british cult horror siren caroline munro is hilariously miscast as an american teenager in the first third of the flick .  the cast all give solid performances ,  with especially stand-out work from carmine iannaccone as smartaleck ringleader skip pollack ,  billy hartman as faded macho meathead frank ,  and donna yeager as foul-mouthed slut stella .  co-producer dick randall has an amusing cameo as munro's sleazy agent manny .  harry manfredini's moody ,  rattling music shamelessly recycles cues from his  " friday the 13th "  scores .  alan pudney's slick cinematography does the trick .  good ,  trashy fun . 
i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months .  i was actually surprised at how good it was .   the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty .  they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly burned .   a few years later ,  the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party .  though ,  not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party .   later through the film ,  the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible .  i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well .   at the end of the film ,  you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened .  but ,  marty is in the hospital with severe burns .  although the murders didn't happen ,  the burns and the pranks apparently did happen .   the acting is terrible but that is fine .   i love the story .  i really sympathize with marty .  it's like tamara  ( 2005 )  .  the bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge .   i would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers .   i give this movie 8 stars out of 10 .  good cheesy slasher ! 
okay ,  sorry ,  but i loved this movie .  i just love the whole 80's genre of these kind of movies ,  because you don't see many like this one anymore !  i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off ,  or a cheesy imitation ,  what is it imitating ?  i've never seen another movie like this one ,  well ,  not horror anyway .   basically its about the popular group in school ,  who like to make everyones lives living hell ,  so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty .  it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks .   so ,  its like 10 years later ,  and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters .  but .  .  . they are the only ones receiving them !  so they return back to the old school ,  and one by one get knocked off by .  .  .  .  .  .  . yeah you probably know what happens !   the only part that disappointed me was the very end .  it could have been left off ,  or thought out better .   i think you should give it a try ,  and try not to be to critical !   ~*~cupidgrl~*~
my 10/10 rating is merely for the fun factor and assumes that you decided that you liked  " slaughter high "  even before watching it .  yes ,  it's the typical revenge-several-years-after-a-dirty-prank story ,  but how can you not like some of the stuff that they pull here ?  !  i couldn't have predicted that bathtub scene in a million years .   ok ,  so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie offers nothing new .  well ,  it doesn't pretend to .  it's the sort of flick that the characters in  " scream "  probably watched ,  and it contributed to their rules about how to survive a horror movie .  after all ,  who doesn't like to watch people suffer for doing these things ?  obviously ,  it's got sort of a reactionary undertone ,  as people get punished for doing what the '60s championed .  but still ,  you gotta love this stuff !  so ,  with apologies to don mclean ,  this jester didn't sing for the king and queen ! 
i have seen slaughter high several times over the years ,  and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humor ,  but i never knew that it was filmed in the uk ,  and i never knew that the actor that plays marty rantzen  ( simon scuddamore )  committed suicide after the film was released .  i guess i did notice while watching it last night that the actors phrasing seems rather odd for americans ,  and a few of them aren't very good at hiding their english accents .   all that aside though ,  this is the tale of the class nerd ,  marty ,  who is the butt of jokes from his classmates ,  and on one particular day ,  april fools day ,  he's lured into the girl's locker room by one caroline munro  ( yes ,  playing a teenager )  and humiliated big time on film .  of course ,  the coach catches the gang at work & they're all given a vigorous workout to punish them ,  but not before a couple of the guys slip marty a joint ,  which he tries to smoke in the chemistry lab ,  but it's full of something that makes him sick & when he runs to the restroom ,  one of his classmates slips in and puts a chemical that reacts with something marty is mixing ,  which results in a fire and the spill of a bottle of nitric acid ,  which leaves poor marty burned & horribly scarred .   ten years later ,  this same gang is headed for their class reunion at good old doddsville high ,  which seems oddly boarded up and inaccessible ,  but thanks to ingenuity they manage to get in and find the place seemingly derelict .  .  . except there's a room where a banquet and liquor is laid out and so of course ,  they eat ,  drink ,  and be merry .  for soon ,  they will die ,  of course .   the gang is stalked one-by-one by a figure in a jester's mask ,  but could it be marty ?  they don't know ,  they figure he's either in a loony bin or working for ibm ,  they're not sure which .  but whoever it is ,  he's making quick work of them .  particularly nasty is the girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when he drank poisoned beer .  she is victim to an acid bath which i believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version ,  because it seemed extra nasty when i watched it this time .  i could be wrong but i believe that wasn't on the tape .   at any rate ,  there's somewhat of a twist ending ,  and that also contains footage not on the tape ,  i believe .  there's also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also excised ,  but apart from that i didn't really notice if there were other bits on this uncut version ,  probably so but it's been a while since i've last seen it .   at any rate ,  if you're a fan of 80's slasher flicks then snap up the new release dvd ,  because it's a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere & feel to it .  7 out of 10 . 
both my friend and i thought this movie was well done .  we expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic thrusts .  we both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy .  i was impressed with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a terrific acting job .  most of the supporting cast are veterans not first timers and they were solid .  we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie .  if you don't buy rent it for a good time . 
it's movies like these that make you wish that you never picked on the nerd growing up in school .  if you liked this movie ,  then i would suggest you watch valentine .  i just found out today that the guy who played marty ( simon )  killed himself a little after the movie was released which is a shame since he did a good job .  i wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie .  it starts out when carol tricks him into going into the girls restroom to act like they were about to do it .  when he was changing in the showers ,  carols popular friends snuck into the bathroom and got everything ready ,  camera ,  electric shock ,  pole .  when marty open the curtain butt naked he realized that he was tricked .  he tries to cover the shower up but the kids open it ,  grab marty and starts being mean to him while the camera is rolling .  they picked him up ,  dunked his head in the toliet while it was being flushed ,  and they electricuted him ( slightly )  .  when the kids are in detention ,  given by the coach ,  2 of the boys give marty a joint that will make him throw up .  skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to excuse him .  while marty is puking in the bathroom skip sneaks into the science lab and mixes some stuff that looks like cocaine but not sure what it was .  the lab blows up disfiguring him badly .  5 years later the kids who tormented him that day got invitations for a 5 year school reunion at the old school which was burn that day it exploded .  one by one the people get killed off .  i don't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned .  she could have gotten back up after marty left .  she almost got out the first time . 
this movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre ,  which is my favorite genre of them all ,  so when i saw it was free on demand ,  i had to watch it !  it stars caroline munro ,  from both dr .  phibes films  ( she was his wife that died !  )  ,  dracula a . d .  1972 ,  the golden voyage of sinbad ,  captain kronos - vampire hunter ,  the spy who loved me ,  maniac ,  and faceless .   brought to you by the people behind don't open til christmas and pieces ,  heres my thoughts on this .  .  .   it opens on april fools day ,  where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower ,  and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet  ( all while hes naked !  )  .  the coach puts a stop to it ,  but both parties swear revenge .  but ,  the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive .   cut to the future ,  and its th high school reunion ,  or so they think  ( bwahahha ?  )  .  the only ones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid ,  and its april fools day  ( or really ,  the day before april fools ,  but the fun starts at midnight )  ,  yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall .  then they finally break into the school and it starts storming .   inside they find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them ,  each of their lockers and belongings ,  along with marty's  ( the nerds )  locker and yearbook .  they also find the old black janitor/caretaker who spends his time saying  " oooh yesser !  yesser !  i don't want no trouble ,  sir !  "  and then is killed instantly .  pretty pointless character ,  but hes still my favorite .   the movie takes a page out of alien's book ,  in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see !  thats when everyone realizes that they're there to die ,  and they start freaking out ,  except for shirley ,  who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this .  of course ,  it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off  ( very cool ,  mind you )  the rest of the night goes as usual ,  sex ,  drugs ,  and marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask .  .  whats their plan ?   " all we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon .  marty wont kill us during mid-day !  "  .  seriously ,  thats what he said .  apparently you can only kill at nighttime .  but will they survive through the night ?  who will live and who will die ?  and why are all the bodies disappearing ?  rent ,  buy ,  or steal this great movie to find out !  the movie is actually very good ,  filled with clichés  ( car wont start ,  dammit !  )  and just plain slasher fun .  not to mention they all have names like carol and nany and frank and joe and susan .  i recommend it to all of you !  and ,  not to mention ,  it has a spin off !  1989's cutting class is a spin-off from this slasher gem ,  and that movie starts the career of brad pitt and roddy mcdowell .   favorite scene :  2 people having sex ,  the guy wants to finish but the girl doesn't .   " talk dirty to me ,  frank !  !  "  she screams  " uh .  .  .  tits !  "   " dirtier !  "   " uh .  .  .  tits .  f*ck .  tits .  boobs .  f*ck .  "  .  it seems to work for her and at her climax ,  the killer electrocutes them both ! 
slaughter high starts like any other day at doddsville county high school where little minx carol manning  ( caroline munro )  has tricked resident nerd marty rantzen  ( simon scuddamore )  into the girls locker rooms where she tells him to get undressed in the shower ,  while doing so carol's gang of friends come in & give the now naked marty a big surprise as they film him as they stick his head down the girls toilet in an april fool's day joke .  the school's sports coach  ( marc smith )  saves marty & punishes the gang who rather harshly blame marty ,  they decide to play another trick on him only this time things get out of hand & marty is caught in an explosion & has nitric acid splashed over his face .  years later & the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school ,  they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there .  they all venture inside where they quickly learn they aren't the only ones there as marty is back & has revenge on his mind .  .  .   originally shot under the title april fool's day which they changed probably because of another slasher film named april fool's day  ( 1986 )  made the same year this american english co-production is unusual in that it has three credited writers & directors ,  george dugdale ,  mark ezra & peter litten  ( after never seeing a film with three credited director's i've now seen two in a week the other being the jean-claude van damme flick kickboxer  ( 1989 )  )  & i have to say i really rather liked slaughter high even though it seems to have a pretty bad reputation .  one of the things i like about the script is that it is a pure unashamed slasher flick ,  it doesn't try to be anything else & it just accepts the genres rules ,  short comings & trappings & plays up to them .  basically it delivers what it promises ,  a homicidal killer ,  blood ,  boobs & babes .  i thought the character's were alright ,  the story was ok even though it's just an excuse to get a load of teens inside an isolated location so some killer can bump them off one at a time & i actually liked the twist ending as well which is also something for which slaughter high gets a lot of flak for .  the first half starts off a little slow but the second half moves along at a rate of knots as there is one gory killing after another .  some of the situations & character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who's complaining ?   despite three credited director's slaughter high turned out pretty good ,  i liked the look of the film a lot .  the isolated rundown school made for a really atmospheric location & looked good ,  the makers throw in a good thunderstorm as well & there's some nice photography especially at the end where there are numerous impressive uninterrupted long lasting stedicam tracking shots which follow carol through various corridors of the rundown school .  while not particularly stylish it certainly looks nice enough & is professionally made .  there is some good gore here including burnt bodies ,  people melted with acid ,  impalings ,  stomach explosions ,  axes in faces & death by lawnmower as well as someone who gets drowned in fecal matter down a drain !  the special effects are also better than one would expect & i was both impressed & pleased with the higher than expected body count .   technically the film is better than i had expected & beats most low budget horror crap that gets released today ,  i would have thought it was relatively low budget itself though .  supposedly set in america this was very obviously shot in england .  harry manfredini composes another score which sounds exactly like all of his other musical scores & is basically the same as the theme from friday the 13th  ( 1980 )  & it's sequels .  anyone living here in the uk will probably recognise billy hartman who played frank as a regular in emmerdale farm  ( one of our nations top rated soap operas )  in which he plays terry woods !  while most horror fans will recognise the sexy caroline munro in a rare staring role .  legendary exploitation producer dick randall did the deed on slaughter high & actually appears in the film as a porno movie producer .  .  .  talk about typecasting !  you can also see a poster for the misunderstood brilliance that was pieces  ( 1982 )  which he also produced behind him in his office .   slaughter high is a slasher film that i liked a lot ,  did you see that ?  i didn't say it was great i actually said i liked it on a personal level & i'm sure the predictable plot & lack of story will probably put many off so i can't recommend it but i can say i liked it ,  make of that what you want .  make sure you you watch the uncut version if you ever decide you want to check it out .  if your not a fan of the slasher flick genre then slaughter high won't change your mind but if your looking for a simple & effective slasher then you could do a lot worse than this . 
wow ,  praise imdb and google ,  for i have been trying to remember the name of this f'ing awesome movie for over 15 years now .  slaughter high ,  man !  hells yeah !   i'm not going to bore you with a plot summary ,  and actors ,  and yadda yadda yadda ,  'cause you all know what's up .  that's why you're here anyway .  what i will do ,  however ,  is explain the fond memory i have of this quintessential 80's d-movie slasher joint .   in 1987 ,  when i was around the age of 7 ,  my father used to rent all these horror movies .  would he care that his kids were watching them with him ?  no .  so ,  at that young age i saw slaughter high .  what i saw in that movie stuck with me big time .  i haven't seen it since ,  but i remember to this day most of the ridiculous kills in the movie .  for example ,  the post-sex scene  ( why is there a metal bed in a school ?  )  gets electrocuted .  or ,  the guy being drowned in a cess pool .  come on !  my personal favorite ,  though .  .  . the exploding stomach from the tainted beer .  amazing !  how can you honestly hate on a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school ,  like ,  10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it ?  then his stomach explodes ?  what !  ?  and that great line :  let's take my car .  .  . it always starts .  classic crap all the way .    i mean ,  i look back now ,  almost 20 years later ,  and laugh at it .  but when i was 7 ,  i was scared sh ! tless .  that jester hat  ( or was it a mask ?  )  that the killer rocks throughout freaked me the f*ck out !   all in all ,  yes ,  a crappy movie .  but for nostalgia purposes and for humor factor this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me .  either stay up every night real late and hope to catch this on same late late late movie show ,  or hunt down a vhs copy and dust off your vcr . 
slaughter high is about a boy named marty .  he was harassed ,  and picked on in high school .  a group of kids played several pranks on him ,  and these pranks were really bad .  the last prank ended tragically .   cue to 5 years later .  the gang of kids meet up again for a reunion .  one of them set it up at the old high school .  the school is now abandoned ,  and they have to break in .  for some reason ,  the janitor is still there ,  but he tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer .   they start partying  , and looking at their old lockers ,  and they see something of marty's .  one girl feels sorry for marty but another guy calms her down .   once the kills begin ,  it is great .  every kills is creative and gory .  we see a figure in a jester mask ,  hunting them one by one throughout the school .  it appears marty is back to exact revenge .  after the first person is killed ,  they find out they are locked in the school .  they begin looking for a way out .   now ,  there are a number of illogical things in this movie .  first of all ,  i don't know anyone who has a 5 year reunion .  second of all ,  after the first kid dies ,  a girl gets blood all over her .  they all run away in a panic ,  yet she runs to the bathroom ,  and finds a bathtub .  hrr friend has just been killed ,  and she decides to take a bath !  ?  more importantly ,  why is there a bathtub in a school bathroom .  anyways ,  the bathtub doesn't seem to really work .  .  .  . and she dies a horrible death this is an 80s movie .  it is a horror slasher .  who cares if it has some illogical parts .  i for one don't .  this movie has really great deaths .  the ending .  .  .  .  there is a twist .  having recently seen haute tension ,  i can compare the two .  the only way they are similar is that there is a twist ,  which kind of left me disappointed .  .  .  .  . then right after the twist ,  comes a great ,  if not the best kill ,  in the movie .   after the last kill ,  the killer looks at the screen and also does something crazy ,  and it was the perfect way to end the movie .  it has me going  " wow .  .  .  " 
i have lost count of how many reviews i've written on slaughter high .  i've read a lot of bad ones and i will say right now this is a fantastic movie .  simon scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide ,  and even though this was his only film ,  he is what made the movie so great .  at first i did not know anything about simon until i read a review about his suicide .  then i found out due to the current webpage at www . imdb . com he was born in 1957 ,  in dayton ,  ohio .  simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man ,  but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses .  he did a good acting job ,  who can disagree ?  i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie .  must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least .  i first saw this movie when i was 12 in the sixth grade .  i agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered ,  and that high schools do not have bath tubs !  i think caroline munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent ,  and unfortunately for simon's death he made no future films .  the reason ( s )  for his suicide are a mystery ,  and hopefully will be discovered in the near future .  doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 years old when he made slaughter high .  he looked like a teenager .  i give this film two thumbs up ,  the best horror film made .  probably because of their horrible acting the others didn't make fame in the movie business .  -jacob young
yes ,  the plot is hardly plausible and very thin .  yes ,  the acting does range from average to laughable .  yes ,  it has been done so many times before .  however what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is .  there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie .  in addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing .  i urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be ;  a scary ,  funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none . 
 " slaughter high "  is ,  perhaps ,  the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s .  it is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout .  that being said ,  it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula :  a group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdown .   the reason why  " slaughter high "  stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over-the-top .  marty ,  the killer ,  has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates .  they electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl's locker room shower ,  jabbed at his crotch with a javelin ,  and ,  to top it off ,  rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure him .   so ,  the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get .  when they reunite years later -- at a high school reunion put on by marty himself -- you realize they haven't matured all that much .  they're a bunch of sociopaths .   it is mind-boggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion ,  which ,  by the way ,  is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair .  and who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers -- as well as marty's -- on display ?  there are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film .  the ending makes little or no sense .  and the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how april fool's day works :  the movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon .   in all ,  the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre ,  despite all of its flaws .  it is hard to understand why it hasn't yet found its way to dvd ,  when so many other run-of-the-mill slasher flicks are graced with special editions . 
god bless 80's slasher films .  this is a fun ,  fun movie .  this is what slasher films are all about .  now i'm not saying horror movies ,  just slasher films .  it goes like this :  a high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders ,  and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong .  disfigured and back for revenge ,  sporting a joker/jester mask  ( pretty creepy looking ,  might i add )  ,  marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later ,  after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion .  that is basically the plot ?  what's wrong with that ?  that's the beauty of 80's slasher films ,  most of them i would say .  a lot of things could be so ridiculous ,  but they keep drawing you more in an' in as they go by .  especially this film .   it features some outrageous killings ,  and some are quite creative as well .   ( poisoning of a beer can ,  acid bath ,  i can't remember a javelin ever being used before in any other slasher film either ) it really is a fun ,  fun movie .  that's all it is .  nevermind the fact that the characters are complete idiots ,  never mind their stupidity ,  and never mind the outrageous ,  random things that occur in this film .  such as lights being able to be controlled by the killer  ( when he's not even switching any buttons ,  you'll see )  and toilets being able to cough up blood ,  baths being able to have acid come out of them ,  just use that as part of your entertainment !  because thats what really makes it entertaining .   movies like this represent 80's slashers .  never again could movies like this get made ,  know why ?  it isn't the 80's anymore .  that is why you should just cherish them for what they are ,  good fun !  i highly recommend this film if you're a hardcore fan of slahsers such as friday the 13th .   one last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well ,  marty rantzen .  a disfigured ,  nerd ,  who kills all his old foes in a creepy jester mask .  a good villain makes a good slasher .  simon scuddamore ,  who played marty apparently committed suicide shortly after slaughter high was released .  that alone adds something creepy to the film ,  and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the marty character ,  i guess .  all in all ,  great 80's slashers fun !  it's a shame it will never be the same again .  .  . 
a serious comedy .  ross hunter-produced movie version of the french play  " les joies de la famille "   ( later americanized as  " a very rich woman "  )  is plush ,  well cast ,  occasionally funny .  .  . and unfortunately timeless .  a wealthy california widow ,  who appears to be frittering away her money ,  is railroaded by her two grown ,  greedy daughters ,  both of whom are afraid mama rosie is carelessly spending their inheritance .  the whole issue of a vital--but aged--woman sent to a rest home against her will ,  and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing ,  is touchy material for a comedy  ( and to his credit ,  director david lowell rich doesn't overload the picture with crass gags or obvious sentiment )  .  some of the humor is a little broad and doesn't work ,  yet rosalind russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note .  sandra dee is also good as rosalind's granddaughter ,  and james farentino is very charming as a young lawyer .  the movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly ,  and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time ,  that the seriousness of  " rosie !  " 's theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending .  the picture leaves you smiling--and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who were never quite so lucky .  *** from ****
i really liked this movie .  of course the idea is pretty much out there .  .  . the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small-time thief to lure a more dangerous thief/computer hacker out of hiding .  but alvin sanders ,  the man who the feds have  " volunteered "  to be implanted with the device ,  is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while .  alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem .  definetly worth a watch . 
as with most rosalind russell movies ,  this one is very entertaining -- it's fun all the way through .  it's definitely one of the last of this genre of film -- just good wholesome entertainment .  give it a try - i don't think you will be disappointed . 
rosalind russell executes a power-house performance as rosie lord ,  a very wealthy woman with greedy heirs .  with an auntie mame-type character ,  this actress can never go wrong .  her very-real terror at being in an insane assylum is a wonderful piece of acting .  everyone should watch this . 
absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch .  .  . i highly recommend this movie .  her performance ,  in my opinion ,  was academy award material !  the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format ,  whether it be tape or dvd .  they are ignoring a very good movie .  but universal has little regard for its library on dvd ,  which is sad .  if you get the chance to see this somewhere  ( not sure why it is rarely even run on cable )  ,  see it !  i won't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film ,  and too many  " reviewers "  spend hours writing about the story ,  which is available anywhere .   a 10 ! 
in addition to being an extremely fun movie ,  may i add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful .  this kind ,  fun loving woman had a great deal of money .  unfortunately ,  she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money .  this woman was lonely since the death of her husband .  he had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down .  to prevent that ,  she bought it .  her daughters were afraid she was throwing away  " their "  money and decided to take action .  the character actors in this film were a great plus also .  i would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library ,  but as of yet ,  it's never been released .  sad . 
reviewed at the world premiere screening sept .  9 ,  2006 at the isabel bader theatre during the toronto international film festival  ( tiff )  .   this had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of ewaste  ( recycled computers ,  keyboards ,  cables etc .  shipped over to china by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back )  and other desolation .   the filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to chinese censorship .  still ,  what was there was interesting .  the bits of a shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens ,  intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking .  the opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well .  scenes of the activity at the three gorges dam project were also a complement to the jia khang-je films at tiff  ( the feature still life/sanxia haoren & the documentary dong )  which were also built around that subject .   director jennifer baichwal ,  producer nick de pencier ,  cinematographer peter mettler and subject edward burtynsky were all there on stage for a q&a after the world premiere .  producer noah weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in china itself . 
i had nowhere to go .  i was on a flight to vancouver .  i would probably have missed this film if i hadn't chosen air canada .  watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front ,  i found this captivating and mesmerising .  i did drift in a couple of places and had to skip back but i had to watch to it's end .  now i'm looking forward to the dvd release in europe though whether i'll be quite as transfixed when i can walk out the door ,  is yet to be discovered !   the photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and 'fills out' the story the photographs tell .   recommended  ( if you have time on your hands )  . 
edward burtynsky is a canadian photographer who makes art out of the least  " artful "  objects imaginable .  everyday items such as crates ,  boxes ,  metal containers ,  etc .  - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects d'art by burtynsky's camera .  he achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them ,  that is .  even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through burtynsky's lens  ( but didn't we already know that from  " wall-e "  ?  )  .  he is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures  ( i . e .  the workers in those places )  ,  with their uniform clothing and robotic movements ,  become part of the industrial landscape .    " manufactured landscapes ,  "  a documentary about burtynsky's work ,  has much of the feel of a  " koyaanisqatsi "  about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns .  indeed ,  director jennifer baichwal and cinematographer peter mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms ,  as their own camera records burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in china ,  a dockyard in bangladesh ,  and the construction site at the massive three rivers gorge dam project in china .  with their fluid camera-work ,  the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of burtynsky's images .  in fact ,  the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows .   the movie does less well when burtynsky gets around to articulating the  " themes "  of his work ,  which ,  quite frankly ,  come out sounding confused ,  contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best .  but it is as a purely aesthetic experience ,  highlighting image and form ,  that  " manufactured landscapes "  resonates most .  in the case of burtynsky ,  perhaps ,  a picture really is worth a thousand words . 
this is the most confronting documentary i have ever seen .  it was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea .  based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centred around the modern industrial growth of china ,  edward burtynsky brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to ignore .   taking no political sides ,  this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies chooses not to educate us about - the by-products of economical growth ,  the externalities paid by citizens of the lesser-developed communities ,  the source of our comforts and the wastes of our consumer lifestyles .   amazing ,  heart-breaking ,  impossible to ignore .  this is a challenging journey but one worth taking - please stop staying ignorant and at least see these photographs of truth without feeling any pressure to take a standing to these issues .  10/10 definitely ! 
i really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie .  this movie was not intended to be a  " deep thought "  movie ,  which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be .  in fact ,  it would appear that if any movie doesn't produce a life altering insight ,  and a deep ,  twisted ,  mind boggling plot ,  they would rate it a 1 or 2 .  don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre ,  people .   this movie was an action/comedy flick ,  and that's all it was intended to be .  and for an action/comedy ,  it was very well done .  i was actually rather surprised that i enjoyed it as much as i did ,  having never really been a jamie foxx fan ,  and having the over-used plot that it has .   the plot was nothing spectacular ,  using the typical criminal gets out of prison ,  and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act  ( see blue streak ,  hudson hawk ,  48 hours ,  etc .  etc .  etc .  )  but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist .  now the  " bad guys "  are actually the  " good guys "  and the real  " bad guy "  is an uber-geek .   jamie foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous ,  while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character ,  and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film .   if you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in  " the matrix "  or a drama such as  " of mice and men "  then this movie isn't for you .  but if you enjoy the raw action ,  excellent fast-paced filming ,  and an occasional twist of humor tossed in ,  this movie won't disappoint you .  i would normally have rated it about an 8  ( on the same level as the die hard trilogy )  ,  but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it should be .   
i had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer's art by presenting the beauty in man's deconstructing the natural landscape .  it certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations ,  setup shots ,  and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide .  put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show .   this film oozes by you supplanting the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that guides you like on slow moving river .  each sequence stands on its own ,  but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability .  there are few words ,  this allowing the grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way .  an awful ,  massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories .  individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our e-waste .  the birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards .  the construction of the three gorges dam ,  the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time .  the time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity that purposefully destroys all relics of the culture that was .   the most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control .  the shot shifts to the orchard behind the spokesperson where you witness the level of the last flood by the toxic water having eaten the bark from the trees ,  demonstrating that nothing but the most hideous vermin could be living in the waters .   the obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy save the earth documentaries .  the artist edward burtynsky explains the method wonderfully .  'by not saying what you should see  many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you don't necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what we're doing is creating problems that run deep .  it is not a simple right or wrong .  it needs a whole new way of thinking' .  the subtlety of this descends into an either/or proposition ,  but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark side .   though never stated directly in any way ,  as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate ,  there is only one conclusion possible  we are doomed .  the progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in .  what he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise .  unlike most films with environmental themes ,  this one ends with no call to arms .  it argues basically what's the point ,  but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally . 
mesmerizing ,  breathtaking and horrifying ,  this hauntingly beautiful film is the  " apocalypse now "  without fiction .  slow in pace ,  quiet in mood ,  it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom .   there is no doubt in my mind -- the nature is plagued and we are the disease .  greed ,  the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress ,  has turned us into something like cancer ,  on its way to consume the host and die with it .  .  .   manufactured landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least i'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again . 
this is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man .  it begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things ,  parts of high-tech equipment presumably ;  it isn't really made very clear .  the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they're herded around outside in little yellow jackets .  the film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory ,  and talking with his crew as he does so .  this is a world of relentless industrialization .  it's a relief at least to know these soulless images aren't going to be presented without a human voice ,  as is the case in nikolaus geyrhalter's gleefully cold documentary about the food industry ,  'our daily bread . ' 'manufactured landscapes' contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town  ( many towns ,  really )  being wiped out by the biggest dam ever ,  with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is .  some of these scenes ,  the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places ,  might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer sebastião salgado .  but this photographer isn't as interested in seeing people up close .  his orientation places him somewhere in between salgado and the cold ,  neutral modern landscape photographs of lewis baltz .   all this happens in china ,  of course ,  though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in bangladesh .  it is backed up by music in a new age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive .  there are a good many stills of the photographer's work--or were some of them made by the film crew ?  it isn't made clear .   edward burtynsky is the name of the photographer .  we see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow .  the irony is that burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted ,  and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring .  he admits himself that he takes no political stand .  when we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film's cinematographer peter mettler ,  burtynsky's work almost amounts to a kind of glorification ,  and hence falsification .  but he is showing us places that ,  if we look closely ,  reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be .   logically ,  but not entirely fortunately ,  it is burtynsky whose voice-overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites .  burtynsky's  " epiphanies "  may have inspired his decades of fine work ,  but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we're changing the planet irreparably ;  are dependent on oil ,  which will run out ;  that china has come into the game of massive industrialization late ,  and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel .  the interest of 'manufactured landscapes' would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it .  the reasons for watching it are two :  to see glimpses of burtynsky's work and the raw materials ,  the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully ;  and to observe scenes from the vast ,  awesome ,  daunting ,  and rather horrifying industrialization of modern china .   because of the limitations of the narration ,  the idea of the title 'manufactured landscapes' feels insufficiently developed .  it even seems a misnomer .  new landscapes they are ,  but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than  " manufactured .  "  'landscapes of waste' or 'wasted landscapes' might be better titles .  there is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject ;  and those who want to know more about edward burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions . 
i have been an admirer of edward burtynsky's work for years ,  and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work ,  thanks to jennifer baichwal's documentary .  the severe beauty of the ship-breaking yard in bangladesh ,  the stone quarry in vermont ,  the enormous assembly plant in china ,  the beleaguered old neighbourhoods in shanghai that are just waiting to be torn down :  these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the filmmaker .   at times i thought of old tv documentaries on abandoned coal mines and plastic-mold factories ;  the sort of stuff i grew up watching .  burtynsky's work has the great value of pointing out how the industrial activity has only shifted to asia ,  it has not stopped .  the strangest scene for me was the computer scrap-yard somewhere in china--the waste had a threatening air about it ,  while the workers were very jovial . 
this is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like  " the corporation "  and  " fahrenheit 9/11 .  "  its commentary is clear and unwavering as is the breathtaking cinematic style of this well crafted feature .  the film manages to impose a powerful sense of how unsteady our world is as we rush toward an environmentally unsustainable future at lightning speed - while showing us the terrifying beauty in our pursuit of progress .    truly a remarkable accomplishment which must be seen by all who care about the world we leave to our children .  bravo !   nb - this is also the only film  ( of 8 )  at varsity theaters  ( toronto )  boasting a stick-on tag which reads .  .  .   " to arrange group viewings please contact .  .  .  .  "   .  .  .  a further testament to the popularity and importance of this gem .   my bet .  .  .  an academy award nomination for best documentary .   ob101
i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie .  i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me .  before i start my review ,  let me first say this .  .  . it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner ,  yet the writers and scott chose a different approach .   plot :   simply stated ,  it's not boring .  most hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people ,  often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit .  this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while .  just for reference ,  i recently watched 'the weather man' and 'lord of war' and while i will say that these movies are excellent ,  and i enjoyed them both tremendously ,  both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told .  they don't take any chances whatsoever ,  and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of american films .  domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking ,   " oh man ,  they're screwed now "  .  and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films .  it has a lot of depth to it ,  in my opinion ,  and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it .  overall ,  this is what kept me so interested in the movie .   characters :   i felt that the characters were accurate .  knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman ,  who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was .  it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that .   choco was also very believable ,  his use of spanish in inappropriate situations ,  his reactions to domino's lack of affection ,  as well as his jealousy issues within the team .  .  . they all rang true to me ,  which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic .   rourke's character was the least interesting to me ,  but it still rang true to me .  he seemed like an ordinary guy ,  trying to make ends meet .  i hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what i got out of it .  he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes ,  yet is still trying to live .   claremont/ladies :  i believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story .  they weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley ,  these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal .  you could empathize with them because ,  to them ,  this child's illness was a problem with no other solution .  these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help .   the mobsters :  they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can .  and i really liked that part .  they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting .   christopher walken/90210 guys :   they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie .  from walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has-beens .  their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable .   cinematography .  .  .  . yes .  .  .  . the cinematography .  this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans .  but in my opinion i thought it was genius ,  the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion .  i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement ,  just like anything else .  i both applaud and congratulate scott ,  the editor ,  the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie .  not only did they go far and above with its presentation ,  they went that much further .  the use of colors ,  both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob ,  bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else .  if you notice ,  in times of less stress or conflict ,  there were very few camera tricks if any at all .  this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it .  i realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach .  hollywood films have grown predictable and bland .  most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns .  and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different .   granted ,  this movie isn't for everyone ,  but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point .  i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it .  i would recommend this to all ,  but i'm sure it will only hit a chord with few .  i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of mtv' won't appreciate this movie ,  but i think many people will .  we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co .  took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique .  and with that in mind ,  i think he succeeded tremendously . 
ah ,  domino is actually a breath of fresh air ,  something new to the cinema world .  i enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot ,  the varied characters ,  and the intense camera effects .  i've seen some complain about the camera work and ,  in fact ,  according to the creators themselves ,  the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time .  all of what you see was the desired effect .  perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before ,  although that's what sets it apart .  in a deeper aspect ,  what you are seeing is just how domino sees things through her eyes ,  think about it .   when it comes to the story ,  i don't see anything quite bad about it .  despite it's  " messy "  nature ,  according to some ,  it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling .  the plot really isn't all that hard to follow ,  if you actually focus on what's going on .  maybe it's just me because i see movies from many different aspects such as the acting ,  the plot ,  etc .  i'm no  " interpreter "  or anything who picks movies apart ,  it just comes to me .  with that said ,  i believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed ,  despite it's future as a cult-classic ,  blockbuster ,  or whatever .   and the characters ,  well there's no doubting how varied the cast is .  i believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively ,  that's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen .  the characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives ,  setting them apart even further .  basically ,  i personally loved the cast and characters .   all those who bash and burn this film perhaps just don't see it as i do ,  or it just doesn't appeal to them .  no matter ,  this is a great film in it's own right ,  no ,  it's a great film period . 
when i rented domino i was expected it to be very dumb .  i hate films that have really flashy editing and cinematography and domino also just got very bad reviews .  the only reason i watched it is because i like have liked keira knightley ,  mickey rourke ,  christopher walken ,  and tony scott on other occasions .  i also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories .  yes the editing and cinematography were frantic ,  the story was weak ,  and the acting was mediocre ,  but i still loved this film for some bizarre reason .  domino was very ,  very entertaining and often very funny .  it was horribly underrated when it was released i think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like scotts last film man on fire and instead just got wonderful entertainment .  i actually understand why everybody hated domino so much ,  even though i loved it and recommend it . 
kiera nightly moved straight from the p&p set to this action movie .  .  .  she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically .  a great success in love actually and as lizie in jane austen's classic ,  she is ,  once again ,   " having a go "  .  just as her bikini clad warrier woman in king arthur was more skin than muscle ,  it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life .  .  .  but then this is exactly what domino harvey  ( the real one )  did ,  and i  ( being one of nightly's biggest fans )  believe she carries if off .   stuff .  .  .  .   * 90210  ( for the non american world )  is the post code of beverly hills in la ,  where all the film stars live .  * domino harvey father's mostfamous film was manchurian candidate  ( which appears in the film )  .  * domino harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in june 2005 ,  after having been arrested for drug dealing .  she had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film .  * kiera knightly alludes to domino harvey's sexuality in her interview with lucy liu .   if you find this film a bit far fetched ,  then check out domino harvey ,  as the facts are more amazing than the fiction . 
domino is a great movie .  it's about a young woman names domino harvey  ( kiera knightley )  who becomes a bounty-hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle .  she joins with two fellow hunters  ( mickey rourke & edgar ramirez )  and the adventures begin .  the script is good .  very down-to-earth and realistic with the tone of the film .  the only problem i had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do ,  instead of the character of domino .   even with that ,  kiera knightley gives a fierce performance .  she shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance .  mickey rourke follows up his oscar-worthy performance in 'sin city' with another tough-guy performance .  edgar ramirez really doesn't do anything except speak spanish every once in a while and stare at kiera .  delroy lindoi gives a good supporting performance .  mo'nique was herself ,  although she did surprise me on one particular scene .  lucy liu has great chemistry with kiera knightley in her scenes with her .   the best thing about the movie though ,  is the direction .  tony scott's fast-paced style really brings the movie to life .  the cinematography is some of the best ,  i've ever seen .  it takes a regular movie and puts on acid .  all the blacks are blacker ,  the whites are brighter ,  and it has a sort of green glow to it .  the action scenes are exhilarating .   overall :  if you liked sin city & man on fire ,  you'll like domino . 
i had no expectations ;  i'd never heard of jamie foxx ;  all i knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it .  i thought it was highly entertaining ;  it was fun .  the plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interest .  to me ,  foxx is an original .  david morse is terrific  ( true ,  this is not his finest role )  .  i thought the chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well done .  i didn't expect a lot and i was happily surprised . 
as soon as i knew keira knighteley being in this flick ,  i said  " i have to watch this movie "  .  she's the undisputed main character ,  domino ,  a bounty hunter .  her  " job "  ,  as the  " no action "  scenes would teach us ,  reflects her rebel ,  violent attitude to life .  i have to admit that it's the very first time that i watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands .  so ,  this stomped me a bit .  anyway ,  for all the john woo's fans ,  there are helicopters falling down ,  explosions ,  gunfire as if it would rain ,  and a lovely keira that shoots with two machine guns ,  one per hand .  the cast is absolutely brilliant .  going beyond keira ,  which in this movie is a real tomboy ,  pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see ,  mickey rourke is back ,  with his usual slap-throwing face and his potent body .  christopher walken makes his job pretty well ,  as a reality show producer .   let's go to the contents :  this movie has a journalistic shape .  the talk show scene is  " disgustingly "  real .  anyone that watched that load of  .   .   .  you-know-what ,  can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations .  as well as the producer ,  when domino's mom says that the reality that should show domino's life is  " trash ;  no offense "  ,  he answers  " i don't take it like an offense "  .  this movie portrays a difficult life .  domino ,  coming from a world that didn't want her ,  ed  ( mickey rourke )  ,  a bounty hunter  " not so bounty "  ,  choco  ( the third guy of the band )  ,  which family is  ( using ed's words )  ,   " the correctional institutes he's been "  ,  and alf ,  the driver/bomber coming from afghanistan during the russian occupation .  this bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born  " without the shirt "  ;  unlucky ,  violent ,  and with nothing to lose ,  excepts their  ( as they would consider )  miserable lives .  the intro of the movie says that it is  " inspired by true story  .   .   .  more or less "  ,  so i couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true .  anyway ,  going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons  ( which could have been  " added "  to make the film easier to see ,  and be classified as an action movie )  ,  the characters' story is too realistic to be  " edulcorated "  .    the interaction between the characters is various ,  well studied ,  and definitely not boring .  what hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist  ( lucy liu ,  sober as never in her acting career )  .  it represents only the reason by which domino starts telling her story  ( and that's a story )  .  probably ,  the only  " con "  ,  in a movie with a lot of  " pros "  .    all in all :  this isn't  " swat "  .  the characters are crafted ;  they have an identity ,  a shape .  they have a name and a surname  ( not just  " gamble "  and  " street "  )  .  it's the case to say ,  it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet . 
i doubt much of this film is based on a true story .  at the beginning it says based on a true story ,  sort of .  i bet the only truth to it was there was an ex-model turned bounty hunter possibly named domino .   anyways ,  it begins with domino talking to lucy liu ,  who works for the fbi .  domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of 10 million dollars .  through flashbacks ,  we see domino as a child ,  then as a model ,  and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter .  she basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off ,  ed and choco .  they let her join the group .  she's tough ,  can use any kind of weapon ,  and will use her good looks if needed .   they get involved with a scam that clarmont ,  a bailsman ,  has going .  along the way ,  the group starts a reality tv show ,  and that's where ian zering and brian austin green become involved .  they are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this .   i thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs .  the editing didn't bother me .  there's also a lot of violence ,  mainly using guns ,  and blood .  it could have been a little shorter .   final verdict :  good enough to watch . 
i'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum ,  and many of the reviews .  i think tony scott made a good movie here .  yes ,  it is highly stylized ,  flashy and over the top ,  but it is very entertaining .  i'm glad at least ebert and roeper agrees with me  :  )    this movie may not be for anyone ,  but if you like over-the-top ,  dark humor ,  cool action and dialog ,  you should see it .    i've previously seen scott's man on fire ,  crimson tide and enemy of the state - all good movies ,  but i like this one more .  it's like a roller-coaster ride ,  with great soundtrack selections ,  visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13 ,  it is nice to see that someone isn't afraid of showing nudity ,  gory violence ,  and have explicit dialog .   it doesn't hurt that keira is super-hot ,  and even shows nipples in this one ,  either .  .  . 
i rented domino on a whim ,  not even knowing it was inspired by a true story ,  and even though it's the least likely and true biopic you'll probably see .  i found it to be rather awesome .   with richard kelly writing he crams together a mass of plots and narratives into 2 hours of pure entertainment .  and once you've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it .    domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career .  it has an edgy acid trip style provided by director tony scott .  and with fast paced music and editing ,  it provides the visual flare to keep your attention ,  with slick performances and unexpected comedy ,  the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience .    i suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours . 
if you go to this movie expecting something it isn't ,  you will be disappointed ,  as with any movie .  this movie contains what hemmingway described as the  " iceberg effect "  .  on the surface ,  its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie .  if this would be written in a book ,  it would be a short story ,  because the action in the movie is very fast paced ,  and unless you actually try to catch it ,  the reasoning behind the plot  ( along with some subtle foreshadowing )  can very well pass you by .  definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate .  experimental cinematography barely describes this movie .  the camera-work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film ,  making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others  ( something to be desired in american movies as of late )  .  although ,  at some parts it may get a little raunchy ,  gruesome and too heavy for some audiences ,  the movie never becomes completely unrealistic .  the only aspect of the movie that i would write off as  " needs improvement "  is the soundtrack selection .  no movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack ,  and although the soundtrack is quite fitting ,  the opening is a little too long ,  and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate  ( heavy ,  grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip )  .  the flooding of imagery and dynamic .  .  .  color palettes adds another  " artistic "  aspect to it ,  also combined with the events that happen throughout the film ,  this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand .  however ,  that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch ,  and not one you'll quickly get bored of .  8 . 5/10
if you find yourself in need of an escape ,  something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world ,  domino will satisfy that need .  this is entertainment ,  after all !  the plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies  ( like usual suspects )  where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out .  i wondered about domino harvey herself ,  how her life became of interest to hollywood .  as for the acting ,  lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers .  and any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well .  not once did i think of kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume .  and granted ,  mickey rourke plays mickey rourke well and often ,  but here ,  despite the violence ,  he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people . 
 "  domino  "  has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and  "  sickening  "  photography .  it's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of  "  style over substance "  i couldn't disagree more .  i believe that  "  domino  "  represents the absolute height of tony scott's film-making career .    after having created the dominant hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties tony scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema .  as early as  " crimson tide "  scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters- the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with dutched-angle framing .  this was then carried through to  "  enemy of the state "  and  " spy game "  which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively .     "  man on fire "  was an extreme departure  ,  a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic .  here scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage  .  although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in  "  domino "   couched in the framing device of an fbi interrogation  "  domino "  presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory .  she grasps at memories as we all do- in fragments ,  flashes and brief snatches .  as domino relays her story verbally scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them .  she does have  "  traces of mescaline "  in her system but her individual vision is anyway unusual -that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting .    it is when domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that scott really lets rip .  together with cinematographer dan mindel and composer harry-gregson williams scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary americana .  gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be domino is no more disjointed than the  " 90210 "  culture she has rejected .  as she wades through this cultural melange scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces .  ultimately scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip .    to criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a picasso or a pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human .  like any great painting the meaning in  "  domino "  is in the surface and the surface is everything .    i am not in any way associated with scott free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of tony scott's work
my name is domino harvery .  {edit *dizzying* chop} my--my--my name is domino harvey .  {cut ,  chop} my name is domino harvey .  {edit .  cut .  playback}  never have i seen a director take so much flack for his style before .  by now it is evident that most people do not appreciate tony scott's choppy ,  flashy ,  dizzying editing technique .  if i have to choose between loving it and hating it ,  i'd say i love it .  it was borderline distracting at times ,  but the end result was pretty good and it's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality  ( even if it borrows heavily from mtv videos )  .   this stylistic edge manifests itself as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy .  otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her ,  no matter how much she suffered .  we follow domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters mickey rourke ,  rizwan abbasi and edgar ramirez .  the crew become tangled up in the fbi and suddenly has a reality show contract under christopher walken's tv production company  ( what is christopher walken doing in every film ,  by the way ?  )  .  i guess that is a clever film technique ,  because now tony scott is free to use as much flashy mtv/reality show editing footage as he likes .  it becomes a pastiche of mtv culture at this point .   it followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid-fire pace ,  with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence .  there are some funny jokes ;  it's all very modern and surreal at the same time .  it's a mess ,  but it's a rather enjoyable mess .  it is ultimately flawed in so many ways  ( the actors try too hard to make their characters  " cool "  ,  for one )  but it works .  i give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie-goers who graded this film  but i feel it had some good ideas and executed them well .   7 out of 10
this was one of my favorite series when i was a kid .  the swedish broadcasting company decided to broadcast it once again a couple of summers ago when i had just finished my first semester of medical school .  i was surprised to see the depth in which the organs was explained .  sure ,  some things are simplified but most of it was correct  ( even though it was made 22 years ago !  )  and quite understandable .  i would suggest that all soon-to-be medical student should watch it .  it is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words for example .  now i'm in my 7th semester and i think i'll watch the series once again as soon as i've bought the dvd-box  : - ) 
this tv-series was one of the ones i loved when i was a kid .  even though i see it now through the pink-shaded glasses of nostalgia ,  i can still tell it was a quality show ,  very educational but still funny .  i have not seen the original french version ,  only the swedish .  i have no idea how good the dubbing was ,  it was too long ago to remember .   the premise of the show was to show you how the body works .  i swear ,  school still hasn't taught me half of what i know from this show .  it also tied in other things ,  like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don't exercise ,  with nice examples within the body .  who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you ?   : d the cartoon looked nice ,  very kids friendly of course ,  but done with care .  cells ,  viruses ,  electric signals in the brain ,  antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures ,  looking pretty much how you'd expect what they should look like in the animated body .   this ,  and the series about history ( especially the environmentally scary finale )  were key parts of my childhood .  i'm so happy i found them here . 
we bought the dvd set of  " es war einmal das leben "   ( german )  /  " once upon a time .  .  .  life "   ( english )  for our bilingual kids because everyone loved the  " es war einmal der mensch "   ( german )  /  " once upon a time .  .  .  man "   ( english )  series  ( us parents had seen it as kids )  and it has exceeded even high expectations !  the series is very well made ,  does not show its age ,  and our kids at various ages really like to watch it .  at the same time ,  they learn things us parents didn't know until way ,  way later .  the series covers everything to do with the human body from organs ,  all senses ,  blood ,  infection ,  antibodies ,  and much more in animated 20-25 min episodes .  topics some people may find  " sensible "  ,  such as digestion and reproduction are covered in a tasteful ,  discreet and child-friendly manner  ( the reproduction episode starts coverage mainly where the baby starts growing )  ,  while still  ( as typical )  informative and fun .   children are usually fascinated with how their bodies work and through the episodes gain an understanding of this in the context of their environment .  the format of the episodes switches between the outside world  ( a family with 2 children )  and the inside of the body .  for example ,  in the episode covering infections ,  the boy cuts himself accidentally and the wound gets infected and the episode covers how the body reacts to this .  similarly ,  the episodes on the senses ,  e . g .  hearing ,  seeing ,  link what happens inside the body to the context of the outside world and the episode on respiration and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the complete lifecycle including  ( briefly )  where the oxygen comes from  ( plants )  .   this is one of the best ever children's programs - i would say it's a must see for every family with kids ! 
actually this movie was not so bad .  it contains action ,  comedy and excitement .  there are good actors in this film ,  for instance doug hutchison  ( percy from  " the green mile "  )  ,  who plays bristol .  another well known actor is jamie kennedy ,  from  " scream "  and  " three kings "  .  the main characters are played by jamie foxx as alvin ,  who was pretty good and also funny ,  but the one who most surprised me ,  was david morse as edgar clenteen .  he plays a different character than he usually does ,  because in other films like  " the green mile "  ,   " indian runner "  ,   " the negotiator "  or  " the langoliers "  he plays a very sympathetic person ,  and in  " bait "  the plays almost the opposite ,  a man without any emotions ,  which was nice to see .  the only really negative thing about this film ,  are the several pictures of the world trade center ,  which makes this film perhaps look a little dated .  overall i thought this was a pretty good little film ! 
this is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins ,  viruses ,  blood cells etc .  i will not try to explain it in more details ,  you will simply have to see it for yourself :  you will not be disappointed .   i remember watching this as a kid in the 80s  ( with swedish voices )  .  i have talked with a few people who were also children in the 80s and they loved it also !  i must admit that the education-part of the episodes didn't get through to me at a conscious level but the whole idea of educating children while they have fun is wonderful .  i have recently seen a few episodes ;  there is a humour and heart in it that is hard to find in other children programs nowadays .   5/5
this animation tv series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works .  yes ,  this is biology but they will never tell it is .   i truly think this is the best part of this stream of  " educational cartoons "  .  i do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts :  skin ,  skeleton ,  and of course :  organs .    in the same stream ,  you'll find :   " il était une fois l'homme "  which relate the human history from the big bang to the 20th century .  there is :   " il était une fois l'espace "  as well  ( about the space and its exploration )  but that one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future . 
you know the story - a group of plucky no-hopers enter a competition they seemingly have no chance of winning - it's a tale that has been done to death by hollywood  ( bring it on ,  the karate kid ,  escape to victory ,  best of the best etc )  .  now korea gives it a go with a taekwondo team struggling for glory  and guess what  the result is predictable but ultimately satisfying .   the fact that this movie doesn't fall flat on its face is down to the talented young cast who really make you care about the characters ,  and this in turn keeps you watching to the end .   fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed  taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of moves and acrobatics seen in most kung fu films ;  the action is limited to  ( albeit impressive )  kicking and the occasional punch .  this doesn't matter though ,  since it is the interaction of the characters and their fight to make something of themselves which makes this movie a success . 
a good korean film about not just taekwondo but what its takes to be good ,  like a thugs way of fighting cannot beat a taekwondo guy in his sport because there are rules ,  just as there are to life and school and this film has undertones of this notion .   the martial arts in the film isn't that good but it is passable and enjoyable .  friends who go on to achieve something they once would mock become stronger through the mind and heart .  this film isn't meant to be taken too seriously as it does have slapstick ,  but it also carries a message .   a good film again from korea . 
the movie never claims to be something spectacular like many films do .  the films props itself as a fun and entertaining time .  and that's exactly what it was .  it is the korean version of a male bring it on .   from the get go you can feel for the rest of the film and how it will end but the enjoyment is not in the surprise twists nor is it the way the film is a carbon copy of another .  instead ,  the enjoyment is held in the journey of how the 2 remaining  " thugs "  came to be men in their own right .  therefore ,  the film is fun and entertaining .   the camera work ,  specially the dolly moves were very well executed .  the script ,  being a tad weak ,  was overly enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2 dimensional but they were full of life and desire .  this film will not win any oscars ,  nor any dvd blockbuster sales ,  but a fun watch and a fun experience . 
sure ,  the plot isn't oldboy .  it seems the only  " great "  movies these days are amazingly shocking or high-budget/hyped in some way .   spin kick is a drama/comedy about a group of people who decide to pour their hearts into tae kwon do .  regardless of what you expect from this film ,  you're guaranteed to feel moved by the work ,  pain ,  and expectations that the characters force themselves to experience .  though comedic at times ,  many moments and characters are rendered beautifully :  there's the old guard character who takes things too seriously ,  the hoodlum turned good-guy who just wants a second chance at life ,  the meek team-substitute who would die happy if he just won once in his life ,  and many other well-rounded characters with their own problems-- but most importantly ,  their own their hopes and dreams .  while the plot and the goals of the movie are simple ,  these aspects of the movie merely highlight the development of the characters as they overcome their personal and inter-personal struggles .    in short ,  this film will leave you feeling fresh ,  determined ,  and satisfied . 
first things first !  this isn't an action movie although there is a lot of action in it !  i think you can compare it to american sports movies !  where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable , winning a game or tournament beyond expectation !  in this case it isn't about football or baseball , but taekwondo !  in the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing !  but soon we will find out that they don't want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life !  it is nice to see them struggle and training !  i was surprised how funny this movie was !  from start till the end you will laugh your pants off !  the young korean actors are very convincing !  go see this wonderful feel good movie ! 
dream quest was a surprisingly good movie .  there were some noticeable goofs ,  but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time .  i did not feel any urge to fast forward during the movie and i found it pretty entertaining .  it gets kind of silly at times ,  but overall i recommend it .  they probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores ,  and some of the costume designs were pretty good . 
dreamquest is by far ,  the best porn movie i've ever viewed .  this is a must see !  !  !  and if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it ,  just skip over the naughty scenes .  of course ,  this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes .  but even then it's enjoyable .  this movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any movie .  .  . even shawshank redemption . 
i watched this movie once and might watch it again ,  but although jamie foxx is good in the movie ,  i feel they could have used a 'less funny' character as alvin sanders .  foxx's scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by edgar clenteen  ( david morse )  are too funny .  david morse again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop .  his tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role .  once again morse meets doug hutchinson  ( bristol )  in the theater .  morse ends up coming down hard on hutchinson .  they are both perfect for this scenario in each film .  i personally love that quality in a film ,  where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film ,  as these two did in the green mile .  overall it was a pretty good movie . 
oh yeah !  jenna jameson did it again !  yeah baby !  this movie rocks .  it was one of the 1st movies i saw of her .  and i have to say i feel in love with her ,  she was great in this move .   her performance was outstanding and what i liked the most was the scenery and the wardrobe it was amazing you can tell that they put a lot into the movie the girls cloth were amazing .   i hope this comment helps and u can buy the movie ,  the storyline is awesome is very unique and i'm sure u are going to like it .  jenna amazed us once more and no wonder the movie won so many awards .  her make-up and wardrobe is very very sexy and the girls on girls scene is amazing .  specially the one where she looks like an angel .  it's a must see and i hope u share my interests
this one is quite a nice surprise .  cute little story of the heroine's quest ,  very surprising metamorphosis of the four-eye prissy soon-to-be-spinster type into a raunchy dd-cup sex queen .    visually a sight for sore eyes ,  not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for  ( most of )  the costumes and make-up of the actors .  an unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation .   back to the positives :  the movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera-shots which you would not expect in a soft core .  loved that scene with the icicles ,  absolute classics potential .  a slight minus only for  ( very )  few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief .    9/10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect . 
very nice action with an interwoven story which actually doesn't suck .  interesting enough to merit watching instead of skipping past to get to the good parts .  having jenna jameson and asia carrere helps liven it up ,  too .  jenna in that sweater and those glasses is just astounding !  worth picking up just to see her ! 
if you've ever wondered why they don't make porn with a plot ,  watch dream quest .  on the one hand ,  you have to give the armstrong credit both for making the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some name power behind it .  on the other hand ,  it also quickly becomes apparent why most porns never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialog connecting sex scenes together .  these people simply cannot act  ( and the story is ,  unfortunately ,  lame to a ridiculous degree )  .   still ,  i gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there didn't seem to be much of an effort to cut corners .  also ,  i'd like to see more attempts like this one .  maybe someday i will see the perfect combination of porn and plot . 
before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched .  as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed ,  i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed .  except asia carrera's sexual scene ,  any sexual scene in this movie doesn't make me feel great  ( you know what i mean )  .  the great jenna jameson doesn't do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of .  felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned .   although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor ,  this movie is very good .  if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies .  story ,  acting ,  direction ,  sets ,  makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great .  the actors of this movie done really good acting ,  they all done a great job .  dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies . 
this is really films outside  ( not in a motel room )  .  with real costumes  ( not only strings and swimsuits )  .  you have to see this movie .  it's the only porn movie i know that is worth watching between the sex scenes .   bon cinema  laurent
this is a more interesting than usual porn movie ,  because it is a fantasy adventure . the production values are high and the acting is ( believe it or not )  pretty good , especially jenna jameson . it`s also in widescreen which helps , it gives a feeling of a real motion picture and not a porn movie . but , of course it is a porn and a really good one with nice costumes , fine atmosphere and scenery . and by the way , the sex is hot .   watch out for this one .  .  . 
saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it .  i work in the jane finch community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and flavour of the community - grit ,  determination ,  exuberance ,  creativity ,  in your faceness with a dose of desperation .  the writing ,  dialogue and acting is solid and i really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process .  great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well .  all the characters are multi dimensional - none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong .  this is a film that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth ,  hip hop and communities like jane finch . 
beforehand notification :  i'm sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here ,  but when i saw the preview for this movie ,  i was thinking  " finally !  "  i have yet to see one movie about popular african-influenced dance  ( be it popular hip hop moves ,  breaking ,  or stepping )  where the main character was a black woman .  i've seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it  ( breakin ,  breakin 2 ,  save the last dance ,  step up )  ,  but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent .  that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop ,  african-influenced dance ,  and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasn't always men who performed it ,  so i felt this movie has been a long time coming .  however ,  the race does not make the film ,  so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot ;  the dancing be entertaining ;  and interesting to watch .   pros :  i really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture .  i can't recall ever seeing a popular ,  mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican ;  had believable accents ;  and weren't stereotypical with the beanies .  the steppers ,  family ,  friends ,  and even the  " thugs "  were all really intelligent ,  realistic people who were trying to love ,  live ,  and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive .  even when the audience was made aware that the main character's sister chose an alternate lifestyle ,  it still didn't make the plot stereotypical .  i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed .  i loved the stepping ;  the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers ;  the trials that the main character's parents were going through ;  and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in a barrel .  i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time ,  and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world .  they were all just as excellent as the fellas .  i don't see that in too many movies nowadays ,  at least not those that would be considered black films .   cons :  i'm not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this ,  but i question whether they've been to real step shows .  whenever the steppers got ready to perform ,  some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers' hand/feet beats .  at a real step show ,  there is zero need for music ,  other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups .  and then when hip hop songs were played ,  sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers' hands and feet .  it was awkward .  i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus  " stomp the yard "   ( another great stepping movie )  because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys  ( in  " stomp the yard ,  "  meagan good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the  ( deltas ?  )  let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately )  .  even when there were very small scenes ,  the ladies tore it up ,  especially in the auto shop ,  and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music .  i know soundtracks have to be sold ,  but the movie folks could've played the music in other parts of the film .   i'm not a keyshia cole fan ,  so every time i saw her ,  all i kept thinking was  " is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks ?  "  she looked uncomfortable on screen to me .  i thought they should've used a host like free or rocsi instead .  deray davis was funny as usual though .  also ,  i groaned when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto ,  like stepping couldn't possibly happen anywhere else .  hollywood ,  as usual .  however ,  only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers ,  which mainstream movies tend to do .   i would've given this movie five stars ,  but the music playing killed it for me .  i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs . 
this film is shockingly underrated on imdb .  like so many films ,  this isn't shawshank .  but it's a reasonably good ,  if predictable ,  dance competition / personal growth film .  if you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 mile for a female step dancer ,  than i think you'll like it .   judging from the imdb ratings ,  my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250 ,  and was  " vote bombed "  with many 1s ,  as happens to so many films that aren't about the mob ,  don't have special effects ,  or include non-white or non-straight characters .   it's an american film ,  but it's not a us film .  set mostly in toronto the cues are subtle ,  and some audiences may think it's set entirely in the us just because the final competition is in the border city of detroit .   i liked the music .  i liked the dance  ( but not convinced it's worth $50 , 000  .  .  .  but what do i know )  .  the characters were easy on the eyes .   i do agree the title sucks .  i don't remember anyone in the film saying those words ,  and it should have an  " s "  .   ( no ,  it's not a foreign language )  .   there's not a lot to hate about this film  ( and let's be honest ,  a vote of 1 means you hated it )  so i can only assume that it's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it ,  and that's sad . 
i watch them all .   it's not better than the amazing ones  ( _strictly ballroom_ ,  _shall we dance ? _  ( japanese version )  ,  but it's completely respectable and pleasingly different in parts .   i am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting .  for example :  the  " name should scream don't watch .  'how she move . ' since when can movie titles ignore grammar ?  "    there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar .  it's just not canadian standard english grammar .  comments about the dialogue seem off to me .  i put on the subtitles because i'm a canadian standard english speaker ,  so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it .  it wasn't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so american .   i loved that this movie was set in toronto and ,  in fact ,  wish it was even more clearly set there .  i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast .  i enjoyed the stepping routines .  i liked the driven mum character .  i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movies .   in summary ,  if you tend to like dance movies ,  then this is a decent one .  if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking ,  your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie . 
well ,  if you are open-minded enough to have liked barber shop ,  then you will like this canadian film .   if your mind is as closed-minded as fort knox ,  then you will give it the current score that it has  :  2 . 5 .   this is a film for anybody prepared to watch films from outside of their own racial grounds .  it is engaging ,  it is true to life ,  on two or three occasions you lose the connections between the scenes ,  but many times ,  especially towards the end ,  you find yourself having a tear or two in your eyes and this simply because it so often mirrors what life can be like .   i like it and recommend it to anyone open minded beyond the traditional american film . 
this movie surprised me .  some things were  " clicheish "  and some technological elements reminded me of the movie  " enemy of the state "  starring will smith .  but for the most part very entertaining- good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo  ( providing some comic relief )  .  this is a movie you can watch over again-say .  .  .  some wednesday night when nothing else is on .  i gave it a 9 for entertainment value . 
i noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and i too didn't have high hopes for it .  i figured it was another  " you got served "  type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting .  i was at the theater and deciding between this and meet the spartans and picked this .  to my surprise the acting wasn't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good .  the fact that it has a lower rating than you got served is absolutely ridiculous .  instead of listening to the garbage posted on here i recommend going to see a matinée showing of this movie so you don't spend too much .  i think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it .  when it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones .  go see the movie and judge for yourself .  hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on dvd and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released .   edit the movie is now moving closer to its correct rating .  over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 ,  a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1 . 
i must give how she move a near-perfect rating because the content is truly great .  as a previous reviewer commented ,  i have no idea how this film has found itself in imdbs bottom 100 list !  that's absolutely ridiculous !  other films--particular those that share the dance theme--can't hold a candle to this one in terms of its combination of top-notch ,  believable acting ,  and amazing dance routines .   from start to finish the underlying story  ( this is not just about winning a competition )  is very easy to delve into ,  and surprisingly realistic .  none of the main characters in this are 2-dimensional by any means and ,  by the end of the film ,  it's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them .   ( and ,  even if you're not the crying type ,  you might get a little weepy-eyed before the credits roll .  )    i definitely recommend this film to dance-lovers and ,  even more so ,  to those who can appreciate a poignant and well-acted storyline .  how she move isn't perfect of course  ( what film is ?  )  ,  but it's definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half-baked plot and/or characters who lack substance .  the actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally enthralling thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers ! 
i was a bit scared to watch this movie due to its rates .  but living in italy titles like this never ever come across and i love step so much that i decided to give it try .  and how surprised i was !  the story is different from any other dance-movie i've seen lately ,  with a deeper meaning than just  " winning "  .  it's touching and well written and well directed .  raya is such a strong character ,  i love the fact that she never doubts herself ,  she's so mature and focused and aware of her talent  ( and what talent rutina wesley has ,  my jaw dropped in the final dance scene )  .  the way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is ,  honestly ,  inspiring .  also ,  the fact that she's not the typical super-hot chick  ( see jessica alba ,  briana evigan ,  jenna dewan ,  zoe seldana .  .  .  )  makes her really appealing and real .  seriously ,  why is this movie rated so low ?  you can understand between the first 5 minutes that it's a good work .  really good actually .  i even cried at the end of the movie .  and the dancing routines are just sick . 
i saw this movie when i was a little girl .  and i have enjoyed it every time .  sure the graphics are a little cheesy ,  compared to now ,  but back in the 70's it was great .  i saw it in the original spanish version only and thought it was wonderful .  that was how i remember my christmases were with my family - magical .  santa claus was amazing and i couldn't wait for him to come back each year .   if you have a child/children and speak spanish ,  bring them up watching this old fashioned version of  " santa claus "  .  it's a different version than we are used to today ,  but who says there is one way ?   it's a fun movie to watch .  it teaches children good vs .  bad .  i don't know how the english subtitled version is or if there is an english one of this ,  but the spanish is the best .  enjoy and happy holidays !  feliz navidad ! 
just get it .  the dvd is cheap and easy to come by ,  the length is now standard and you've gone long enough without it .   ( when home video started ,  there were at least three versions with parts missing .  .  )  everything you've read is true .  there is no defending it ,  and no living without it .  the color is lush and wonderful to look at ,  and the production values are pretty good for a saturday afternoon kiddie epic .  but no question .  . the whole santa vs .  satan angle is so jaw dropping strange it made the movie a hit at the time and a cult fave once home video really got underway .  how good/bad/strange/ is it ?  i only saw the trailer as a kid , and remembered it for nearly 30 years .  . including murray's over the top voice over .  . i told my older sister ,  and she called me a liar and could not believe it was possible for anyone to make a movie where santa vs . satan .  .  add to it stuff like santa asking for the virgin mary's blessing before setting off on christmas eve ,  kids wanting to capture him and make him their slave .  . and an international kiddie sweat shop .  . and it probably comes close to a lot of nightmares kids had in the 60's .  .  like others here ,  i watch the thing every holiday season now .   ( my version of choice is the mystery science theatre 3000 edition )  .  but any old way you choose it ,  the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total must  ( along with brianiac ,  by the way .  .  )  . it never fails to make me laugh .  better ,  i think ,  then santa claus conquers the martians .  parts of it can still make you cringe or just creep you out .  ( how many parents do you know go out for cocktails on christmas eve ?   " if you get bored ,  just go downstairs and play the piano .  "  dang .  .  )  freaky ,  boring ,  disturbing ,  funny ,  childish ,  strange .  . hey ,  what more can you want ? 
perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing ,  albeit ,  completely corny ,  to adults .  not a bad film for a low-budget job .  children will be amazed with santa's workshop and the  " magic "  that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small ,  or homes that have no chimneys at all !   kids will thrill over the santa's success at thwarting the nasty devil named pitch  ( complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail !  )  .  they will sympathize with the poor little girl who's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love .  and the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents .  and what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by pitch to help capture santa and ruin christmas ?  in the end ,  everyone ,  including the nasty boys ,  get just what they deserve for christmas !   the film will endear children to both santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world .   
i saw this movie when mystery science theater ran it in 1993 .  it is the worst thing i've ever seen .  so bad in fact ,  that by sheer freakiness ,  this movie must get a ten rating because it has to be seen to be believed .    whoever wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten .  i mean ,  really ,  the devil vs .  santa ?  visions of hell ?  creepy laughing wind-up reindeer ?  forced child labor with racial stereotypes ?  it ain't sesame street ,  that's for sure . as crow exclaims during the mst3k showing ,   " this is good ol' fashioned nightmare fuel !  "    there's plenty of weird innuendo and screwed up theology .  merlin  ( presumably the arthurian merlin )  hangs out with santa in his crazy castle in the clouds  ( i . e .  heaven )  .  santa talks about baby jesus and sends letters to  " mr .  stork "  for children who ask for siblings .  there are symbols around the castle that either look like pentagrams or raf stars .    my best friend and i have watch it every year since 1993 and we subject anybody we can hold down for 2 hours to watch it with us . 
there are some things i will never understand ;  why underwear comes in packs of threes when clearly thats not enough is an example .  similarly ,  i will never understand this film ,  and that is brilliant .  if you approach this film expecting an actual movie ,  you might as well be approaching satan expecting a hug ;  although that may well be possible if you greet this film's satanic figures .  take pitch for instance ;  the most ineffectual ,  camp ,  unhellish portrayal of a devil since freddy mercury and wayne sleep joined forces to create a ten foot satan costume from red body paint and horns covered with condoms .  however ,  it does create some of the most hilarious moments of any film ever .  seriously ,  this is no understatement .  the same can be applied to every other character ,  bar the little girl who acts so sickly innocent she's probably overcompensating for some serious crime she's part of .  then again ,  if santa's inter-space recon station is real ,  there is no chance she could have avoided him this long .  put simply ,  if you haven't seen this movie ,  you cannot consider yourself a serious buff .  the achingly funny characterisation ,  acting ,  concept ,  and almost-under-the-radar racism makes this a must see above any film to date  ( if you're after pure laughter that is )  . 
my mother took me to see this film as a child and i long to see it every year as i do all of my other christmas favorites .  what i remember most was the silly devil and santa looking through his telescope .  i waited and looked through the t . v .  guide each year after that to see when it would be shown .  i would usually find it playing on a saturday afternoon .  i only found the movie in english which took something special away from the film and have longed to find a copy of it in spanish .  i hold this film dear to my heart and have never suffered from nightmares as others might suggest .  yes ,  it is a different film about santa claus and that is what makes it special and unique .  i can't wait to get a copy of this film and watch it with my children as i explain to them my favorite parts and memories !  ! 
shawshank ,  godfather ,  pulp fiction .  .  .  all good films .  great films .  but nothing ,  and i mean nothing lives up to the greatest christmas movie of all ,  santa claus .   the film is so great and has so many messages ,  i cried while watching it .  seriously ,  this is one of those movies you need to watch 10 times .  when we see pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream ,  we see the sadness in his eyes ,  and we feel the deep sorrow ,  and then we wonder .  .  .  what is so bad about this ice cream ?  is it implying that we as humans are treating ice cream as good when all it does is make us evil ?  think movie makes you think .   this movie has the best rendition of santa claus ever .  unlike other santas ,  he is a normal person .  we see him imprisoning children and spying on kids dreams ,  and we wonder ;  is the santa we believe in really that good ?  also ,  this santa actually mentions christ ,  the whole meaning behind christmas .   you owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece .  we should just stop making movies and air nothing but this epic 24/7 .  whether it's christmas or not ,  this movie gets a 500/10 .  whoever says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool . 
this movie surprised me .  some things were  " clicheish "  and some technological elements reminded me of the movie  " enemy of the state "  starring will smith .  but for the most part very entertaining- good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo  ( providing some comic relief )  .  this is a movie you can watch over again-say .  .  .  some wednesday night when nothing else is on .  i gave it a 9 for entertainment value . 
brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day christmas ceremonies .  the voyeuristic element during the scenes  ( santa & pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope )  is unique  ( and obviously jean-luc godard ,  although he was subtle ,  stole this theme in his film  " pierrot le-fou "  )  .  highly recommended ! 
this film was excellent ,  i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre .  this one however got all the ingredients ,  a factory 1970 hemi challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that mother mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars !  i was in chrysler heaven every time kowalski floored that big block hemi ,  and he sure did that a lot  :  ) 
this is definitely an appropriate update for the original ,  except that  " party on the left is now party on the right .  "  like the original ,  this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty .  it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous ,  and over-powerful federal government .  kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge ,  where the us government ,  with the cooperation of the mainstream media ,  threw around words like  " white supremacist "  and  " right wing extremists as well as trumped-up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights ,  with the willing acquiescence of the general populace .  that message is so non-pc ,  i am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick ,  katherine prudhomme ,  the western journalism center ,  and countless others who dared to speak out .   " live free or die "  is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays  " the voice ,  "  and that sums up the dangerous  ( to some )  message of this film .   
i really liked this version of 'vanishing point' as opposed to the 1971 version .  i found the 1971 version quite boring .  if i can get up in the middle of a movie a few times ( as i did with the 1971 version )  than to me ,  it is not all that great .  of course ,  this could be due to the fact that i was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out .  however ,  i have seen many remakes ,  where i have liked the original and older one better .  i found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version .  in my opinion ,  i felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn't so  " blase "  .  ( boring ) 
sure this was a remake of a 70's film ,  but it had the suspense and action of a current film ,  say breakdown .  he's running ,  desperate to be with his hospitalized wife ,  the police are the least concern .  the chases were very good ,  the part with him being  cornered at a rest stop was well done ,  the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger .  this is better than bullitt ,  a boring movie with what ,  a muscle car chase that was filmed badly ?  vigo's character knew what he had to do to escape johnny law ,  few movies had the effects-night vision ,  cb radio-okay i forgot the name of the movie ,  guy has 76'caddy souped up ,  toys with guy he upset .  the ending is great ,  you can't tell if he fakes his suicide or not ,  a very good did-he-make-it-or-not . 
its not as good as the first movie , but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scenes , on the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his ailing wife , the ending is great just a good fair movie to watch in my opinion ,   
sure ,  it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny ,  but at least the filmmakers didn't try .  while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity ,  this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it .  the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film ,  and viggo mortensen displays shades of aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules .  most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy ,  but the scene with the mountain lion was intense .  i was kind of annoyed by jason priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock-jock ,  but then again ,  it's a tv movie !  despite all of the good things ,  the soundtrack was atrocious .  however ,  it was nice to see tucson ,  arizona prominently featured in the film . 
spoilers through :    i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie .  it's not a classic but it's definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride .  i definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating .   perhaps the reason i liked it is because i haven't seen the original . something tells me that with a movie like this it's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus ,  have little to compare it to .  this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original .   there were a few things i liked about it .  one was the casting of kowalkski .  viggo mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role .  since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders ,  he really needed to be excellent and he was .  this was a great role for him .   another interesting thing about vansishing point was the fact that it's made for television .  i had no idea this was the case when watching it .  it sure seemed like a major motion picture and i would never have guessed this was not a big screen release .   i also found the story to be very absorbing .  i'm not one for action movies but i got sucked into this .  plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama ,  mysticism ,  a love story ,  quirky people every which way you turned .   ( i didn't even recognize priestly .  )  and it was touching .  this was not a great movie but it is watchable .   and then there's the ending .  it packs a strong punch and if one's been involved in the story up to that point ,  it's very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end .  i am not sure how i feel about the ending .  the implication was that kowalkski survived and though i'm highly skeptical of how that would be possible ,  it is a movie and realism isn't an ingredient that's always in the mix when making a movie .   so i'd have to say i found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way ,  which i don't usually like but for some reason ,  is almost forgivable in this movie .  admittedly ,  a lot of things were just props for the plot ( could the villains have been anymore stereotypical ?  )  but the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well .  however ,  having said that ,  i will admit i can understand why someone who's a major fan of the original would hate this version because ,  though i have not seen the original ,  i have seen many original movies i loved being remade with terrible results .   ( my big dislike is actually sequels .  )  but i can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality .   people have compared this to smoky and the bandit .  how about a road version of  " legends of the fall "  meets  " thelma and louese "  as well ?  i sure felt touches of both films ( both of which i'm a fan of .  )  i do not think however ,  that this was a great film .  it was better then average to me but far from great .  but it was an absorbing ,  adrenalin fueled ,  touching movie with excellent casting of the main character .  my vote is 7 of 10 . 
i have to agree with most of the other posts .  was it a comedy ?  a drama ?  to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side .  i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived .  jamie keeps running into the julio and whats his name .  in new york ,  how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown cleveland . and just how could robert pastorelli dig up yankee stadium to hide the gold .  again ,  a comedy or drama ?  but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning .  i enjoyed kimberly elise's performance ,  she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously .  she is a younger actress that is going to be viable . 
i have to say ,  i loved vanishing point .  i've seen the original ,  and this is a pretty good remake of it .  even though it didn't follow the original storyline  ( that's why i gave it 8 out of 10 )  ,  it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline .   as for the car ,  well the dj's comment at the end about the challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable  ( and if you look ,  the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145-150 )  ,  but even though i didn't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine ,  the original storyline had a supercharged hemi ,  so it's possible .  for those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it ,  the normally aspirated chrysler 300c of today can go 168 mph ,  and if you look at that thing ,  going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph .  plus ,  in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic . 
to start off with ,  since this movie is a remake of a classic ,  the rating has to be lowered already .  since this version stars viggo mortensen in the lead role of kowalski ,  it helps .   isn't this just like the united states government though ,  to terrorize one of its own citizens .  sounds like jason priestley's character from the movie !  but it is the truth ,  the government would do anything possible to destroy a man's life for trying to get home to his wife .  a wife ,  who is in labor no less ,  and may not make it .    " there was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife .  "  the words of the disc jockey .   there were some great shots of scenery in this film ,  and great car chases and a lot of spirituality .  after much consideration ,  i gave this film a 7 . 
any movie that shows federal pigs  ( persons in government )  to be the power-mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me .   alas ,  the script supervision and editing and even ,  at times ,  the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments .   i saw the original way back when it was new and hated it ,  despised it ,  loathed it .  thought it was a terrible ,  irrational piece of junk .   now ,  though ,  i don't remember why .   i believe the two should not be compared or even connected .   consider them as two different movies .   rate them as two different movies .   this  " vanishing point "  provides a rallying place ,  a banner for people who want to encourage individualism ,  who believe in human rights ,  who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is ,  especially the federal government .    " the voice "  wears a cap bearing the state motto of new hampshire :   " live free or die .  "  at one time it would have been the motto of most americans .   despite its obvious flaws ,   " vanishing point "  is a film to cheer . 
in canadian director kari skogland's film adaptation of the margaret laurence novel the stone angel ellen burstyn is hagar shipley ,  a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end ,  stubbornly refusing to be placed in a nursing home by her well-meaning son marvin .  filmed in manitoba ,  canada and set in the fictional town of manawaka ,  the stone angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in canadian high school english classes for almost half a century .   the title of the film comes from the stone statue erected on hagar's mother's grave which serves as a metaphor for hagar's inability to express emotion during her tumultuous lifetime .  burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego-driven ,  self-defeating character who managed to alienate her wealthy father ,  her well-meaning but alcoholic husband ,  and both of her sons .  as she nears the end of her days ,  she reflects that  " pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear .  i was alone ,  never anything else ,  and never free ,  for i carried my chains within me ,  and they spread out from me and shackled all i touched "  .   confronting having to spend her last days in a nursing home ,  hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships ,  her recollections shown in flashbacks without voice-over narration .  the story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl .  chaperoned by her aunt dolly ,  she meets her future husband ,  the previously married bram shipley  ( cole/wings hauser )  ,  a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is sullied because of his association with the native american population .  the young hagar is played by christine horne who is exceptional in her first feature role .  despite hagar's pleading ,  her relationship with bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot .  this is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of manawaka ,  condemning the young couple to a life of poverty .   going through the motions of her marriage to bram ,  hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town's upper classes .  when she produces two sons ,  marvin  ( dylan baker )  and john  ( kevin zegers )  ,  she is unable to give them the love that they need .   " every joy i might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning "  ,  she reflects ,   " all were forced to a standstill by some break of proper appearanceswhen did i ever speak the heart's truth ?  "  like the biblical hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride ,  hagar leaves manawaka to live in ontario but eventually returns to the shipley farm .   as the scene shifts back to the present ,  hagar runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a nursing home by marvin and his wife doris  ( sheila mccarthy )  ,  here she meets a young man named leo  ( luke kirby )  who takes an interest in her and compels her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life .  the stone angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where i felt any stake in the story's outcome ,  although the spirited performance by ellen page as john's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film's second half . 
i saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in canada  ( still only in limited release )  .  it was worth the wait and then some .  i am a very avid reader of margaret laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film .  i actually ended up liking the movie better than the novel .  i liked that the character of bram shipley was a bit less harsh ,  and that there seemed to be more of a love story between hagar and bram ,  which made the scenes at the end of bram's life that much more moving .  the loss seemed stronger .  hagar was not any more likable on film than in the book ,  but ellen burstyn was a genius in this role .  she was hagar through and through .  christine horne was brilliant and has many more great things ahead i am sure .  her scenes with cole hauser were electrifying .  i could go on and on ,  overall a 9 * out of 10 .  fantastic and can't wait for it to come out on dvd ,  a must own for my collection ! 
this movie is about basically human relations ,  and the interaction between them .  the main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past ,  doing an analysis of how she lived her life .  this journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home .  it is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life ,  and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy ,  real love ,  marriage or destiny .  although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new ,  this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas .  there is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable ,  but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed .  i really recommend this movie for a quiet saturday afternoon . 
i was surprised at just how much i enjoyed this most thoughtfully delivered drama ,  which owing to its rather unimpressive 6 . 6 rating ,  i nearly missed ;  as i rarely give the time of day to any movie rated below 7/10 .  having said that ,  i'm so glad i gave stone angel the viewing it so very much deserved .  and so should you ,  if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive ,  soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form .   i must say that in many ways  ( though not all )  ,  viz .  its themes ,  execution ,  style ,  production etc .  ,  stone angel very much reminded me of the much praised  " the notebook "  .  i am so surprised that other commentators didn't pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie ,  so i can only assume that those who've written comments have yet to see the notebook .  they may not share any alzheimer's theme ,  yet i can confidently say that if you very much enjoyed  " the notebook "  you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully with  " the stone angel "  .  but even if you've not seen the notebook ,  nor read the book on which this move is based ,   ( which ,  incidentally ,  i haven't either )  you should definitely find much to hold your attention firmly - as long as your favourite genres don't include fast paced action thrillers .  this is a movie for thinkers and those who like to reminisce about time's passing ,  how life changes as the years pass ,  and what might have happened in one's life as one gazes back through the years .   this bizarrely underrated yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately 8/10 .  i can only blame its current lowish rating of 6 . 6/10 on the 11% of idiots who gave it 1/10 .  after all it has attracted less than 300 votes at the time of my writing this comment .  nonetheless ,  if those 11% who gave it the lowest ranking possible were really expecting car chases and explosions why didn't they look .  .  .  for even a few seconds at the movie's premise and promotional lines ?  oh dear .  .  .  whatever the world is coming to ,  don't miss this most underrated gem of a movie - but only *if* you have a brain  ( i . e .  ,  your top ten doesn't include transformers ,  fight club nor the terminator )  . 
i saw this film in winnipeg recently - appropriate ,  given the location used .  i first read lawrence's book back in the 70's and for me ,  it's always been a very powerful picture of the trials of aging in our society .  it resonated when i was young ,  and it resonates even more now .  when the film came out ,  i was keen to see if the story could survive .  and was thoroughly impressed ,  especially with ellen burstyn's performance .  she manages to give us a complete human being ,  even though the character is generally cranky and judgmental - someone that you wouldn't want to live with .  it's great to be able to see favourite characters come to life so authentically . 
as perhaps one of the few canadians who did not read the book in high school ,  i thought i would add my comments .  seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film .  the characters have so many complexities ,  everyone can relate to them in their own way .  the brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters ,  rather than being spoon-fed an opinion .  you can love them or dislike them ,  and still feel the emotional impact of the movie .  wonderful performances by ellen burstyn and christine horne really bring the characters to life .  i'd highly recommend it . 
i was very moved by the story and because i am going through something similar with my own parents ,  i really connected .  it is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate .  and then there's the mistakes they made and have to live with .  i loved ellen burstyn's performance and who is christine horne ?  she's fantastic !  a real find .  there is probably the most erotic scene i've ever seen in a film ,  yet nothing was shown - it was just so beautifully done .  overall the look and feel of the film was stunning ,  a real emotional journey .  cole hauser is very very good in this picture ,  he humanizes a man spiraling downwards .  i liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life ,  never sentimental ,  never too much - just enough to hook us in ,  but not enough to bog down . 
this is a really interesting movie .  it is an action movie with comedy mixed in .  foxx teams up with comedian epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin .  it will keep you wondering whats going to happen to foxx next .  it was a well shot movie ,  the director used the right colors in this movie ( dark blue colors )  to give it the right kind of feel .  kimberly elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen .  she plays her role well .  even jamie kennedy is in this movie .  it's worth seeing it you haven't seen it .  it's definitely worth having if you are a jamie foxx fan .  it deserves more credit than it is actually given . 
what i loved about the on-screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel !  great film !  as an avid reader ,  i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation .  you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film .   ellen burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar .  however ,  i think the canadian actress  ( christine horne )  chosen to play hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise .  i haven't seen any of horne's previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel performance .   i heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer 2008 .  i can't wait to see it on the big screen again ! 
i had a chance to see a screening of this movie recently .  i believe that it will be in theaters in canada some time around mother's day .  if it is in a theater near you .  .  .  go !  it's not a funny feel-good movie - it's more along the lines of a feel and think movie .   the director does an excellent job of character development - letting you into the heart ,  mind and hurts of hagar little by little .  at first ,  her attitudes and behaviors don't make much sense .  as her story unfolds ,  she becomes someone you can understand .  as in life .  .  .  understanding brings empathy .  i found her likable by the end of the movie - particularly when she opens up her heart to the young man in the shack by the lake .   hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful - and reflective of so many of our own experiences in this world .  her youngest son ,  john ,  who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the very edge of their seat - and into the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare .   it's fun to see ellen page acting in this movie .  she is so very different than the young woman that she plays in juno .  it gives me an even broader appreciation for her acting ability .  if you loved her in juno ,  you'll love her in the stone angel .   of course ,  there is ellen burnstyn as hagar .  there is likely no way of expressing the power of acting as strongly as the ability for the actor to make you forget every other character they have ever played .  never once in the course of this movie did i ever think of ellen burnstyn - i always and only thought of hagar .  she swept me into her character - hook ,  line and sinker .   kari skogland's capacity to capture on film this renowned book by one of canada's most cherished authors is impressive .  she brilliantly brings to the screen both the stoney and angelic parts of this complex woman ,  hagar - the stone angel . 
a christmas together actually came before my time ,  but i've been raised on john denver and the songs from this special were always my family's christmas music .  for years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was christmas .  a few years ago ,  i was finally able to track down a video of it on ebay ,  so after listening to all the music for some 21 years ,  i got to see john and the muppets in action for myself .  if you ever get the chance ,  it's a lot of fun--great music ,  heart-warming and cheesy .  it's also interesting to see the 70's versions of the muppets and compare them to their newer versions today .  i believe denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this--i guess normally performers don't compromise their images by doing sing-a-longs with the muppets ,  but i'm glad he did .  even if you can't track down the video ,  the soundtrack is worth it too .  it has some muppified traditional favorites ,  but also some original denver tunes as well . 
i saw the movie recently and really liked it .  i surprised myself and cried .  this movie is in the same niche genre as  " away from her "  - or even  " the bucket list "  but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity .  it's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as hagar .  the director does a masterful job with the challenge .  hagar's hard to understand .  her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all .   the first scene gets this across without any compromise .  hagar  ( ellen burnstyn )  is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law .  she figures it out en-route and freaks out .  her edges are really hard .  she is mean .  she is belittling and selfish .  she is a stone .  i didn't like her - not even a little bit .   throughout the course of the movie ,  we get insight .  we find out why she doesn't like petunias ,  why she favors one son over the other ,  how her losses have formed her character .  .  .  i started to see the angel .  .  .  and i started to like her .  i especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack .  ellen burnstyn ,  you are a brilliant actor .  kudos .  kudos .  kudos .  what a scene !   this isn't a  " feel good "  movie ,  but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy .  i understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect ,  they are there for a reason .  .  .   hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor .  .  .  but parts of her are present in many women  ( and men )  in my life .  those parts somehow make more sense to me now that i've watched the stone angel . 
i am amazed at how this movie ( and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on imdb .  the fanboy mentality strikes again .  when this movie came out just about everyone slammed it .  even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable .  years later i sat down to watch this movie and i found myself enjoying .  even laughing quite a bit .  this and the replacement killers are the movies that had people labeling the director antoine fuqua as the black michael bay .  i don't see how since most of fuqua's movies are smarter than anything michael bay has came up with .  at any rate .  .  .   story :  alvin sanders ( jamie foxx )  is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense treasury agent edgar ( david morse )  as a pawn to catch a killer named bristol ( doug hutchinson )  .  alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident .  while these agents are after bristol ,  bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry .   jamie foxx is funny as well as great as alvin sanders .  alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on .  doug hutchinson is okay as bristol .  he can be over-the-top sometimes in his john malkovitchesque demeanor .  he was better here than he was as looney bin jim in punisher :  war zone .  david morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent .  even mike epps is funny as alvin's brother stevie .  both him and jamie had some funny moments on screen .   the only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat .  the scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but i couldn't look away .  the director went all out there so he gets points for that .  plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty .   all in all bait is not a bad movie by a long shot .  its never boring ,  its always funny and i wasn't checking my watch every minute .  that should count for something .  bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period .   ps :  to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent .  .  .  .  how long have you been living under a rock ?  i'm pretty sure you've seen the die hard series and every movie by quentin tarantino .  but those movies aren't violent right ?  weirdo . 
i thought this movie was hysterical .  i have watched it many times and recommend it highly .  mel brooks ,  was excellent .  the cast was fantastic .  . i don't understand how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating .  i loved it .  .  i have seen other movies of his and they were also funny but this one really stick out in my mind because of the humor .  .  his i just can't say enough about this movie .  i look for it to be on periodically but it never on enough for me .  the people playing the homeless people were by comparison up to the funniest standards also .  please put this movie on more often .  i can't see it enough .  . leslie ann warren also was another favorite of mine ,  ever since cinderella .  i always thought that she wasn't really funny but loved her acting .  in this movie she was very funny .  . and her and mel did a great job together .  they should put more of his movies on tv . 
 .  .  . this is a classic with so many great dialogs and scenes nobody should miss .  nice story ,  funny riches-to-rags situations ,  mel brooks is not a bad lead ,  maybe not perfect but he is funny  ; d don't pay attention to the rating ,  it's bs .  watch it ,  then watch something like final destination  ( 2009 )  and tell me that life stinks deserves about the same rating .  if you do ,  i don't think we can be friends xd at this point i recommend the fourth season of  " curb your enthusiasm "  to every brooks fan  ;  )  vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of inchworms !  i've to make 10 lines here to post a comment ?  i don't wanna write a book here  : p
the most hillarious and funny brooks movie i ever seen .  i can watch and re-watch the tape 100 times .  i laugh my a** off and i cry on some moments .  it is really good and funny movie ,  and if you like brooks - this is a must !  in short - brooks  ( billionare )  gets to the streets as homeless for 30 days in order to win the entire poor district from his competitor .  the reality bites ,  but in the end - it is about warm relations between humans .  .  .  hightly recommend ! 
 " life stinks "  is a parody of life and death ,  happiness and depression .  the black and the white always present in our lives .  mel brooks performance is brilliant as always ,  and the other actors work is fine too .  this movie has some capra flavor ,  that´s why is so good .   there are some unforgettable gags such as the one when brooks tries to earn some money dancing in the street ,  and all the people passing by just ignore him ,  or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes is paul getty and then start arguing and slapping each other .   if you haven´t seen it ,  you don´t know what you´ve missed .   this movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich .    the only difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending ,  and reality hasn´t .   yes indeed ,  life stinks . 
this is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine ,  the fire on ,  and with your feet up .  it doesn't require that much brain-power to follow ,  so is very good after a long day .  i would say it is very unrealistic - if you expecting anything serious ,  then don't bother ,  but it is very funny .  just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a slum for a while ,  and then actually get to enjoy it .  .  .  i would definitely recommend it . 
i have not read the other comments on the film ,  but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary .   i watched it for the second time with my children .  they absolutely loved it .  true ,  it did not have the adults rolling around the floor ,  but the sound of the children's enjoyment made it seem so .   it is a true mel brooks farce ,  with plenty of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money ,  not for whom we are ,  and how fickle are our friends and associates .  there are many other films on a similar subject matter ,  no doubt ,  many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults .  it's hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family ,  however .   hence ,  for the children ,  a 9/10 from me . 
life stinks  ( 1991 )  was a step below mel brooks other productions .  he stars as a rich man who wages an insane wager with his  " friends "  .  brooks claims that he can life like a homeless man for a month .  his shocked and amused friends accept this unusual wager .  during his  " stay "  in the bowery ,  he meets a bunch of odd homeless people ,  one of them catches his fancy  ( lesley-ann warren )  .  they strike up a friendship as she teaches him the many tricks she learned whilst living on the street .  can mr .  brooks survive on his own without the luxuries of being filthy rich ?  will he win this unorthodox wager ?  who are his true friends ?  find out when you watch life stinks to find out !   this film has been slagged unfairly .  sure it's not a classic like his earlier films but it's still enjoyable .  i liked the way mel brooks pays homage to charles chaplin in this film .  if you have watched chaplin's earlier silent films then you'll get the humor as well .   recommended for mel brooks fans . 
seeing as the vote average was pretty low ,  and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was  " just ok "  ,  i didn't have much expectations when renting this film .   but contrary to the above ,  i enjoyed it a lot .  this is a charming movie .  it didn't need to grow on me ,  i enjoyed it from the beginning .  mel brooks gives a great performance as the lead character ,  i think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies .   there's not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that ,  but there are some rather hilarious scenes ,  and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch film .   very recommended . 
the plot had some wretched ,  unbelievable twists .  however ,  the chemistry between mel brooks and leslie ann warren was excellent .  the insight that she comes to ,   " there are just moments ,  "  provides a philosophical handle by which anyone could pick up ,  and embrace ,  life .   that was one of several moments that were wonderfully memorable .
